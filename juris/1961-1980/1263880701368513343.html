Secretary of Justice Vicente <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos against the
then respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Marcos of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, now retired after having reached the age of seventy,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>arose from
the issuance of a search warrant past 12:00 midnight of April 4, 1971, and
thereafter served and executed approximately two hours later, long before
dawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds alleged were that the
search warrant was not limited to one offense covering both illegal possession
of firearms and violation of Central Bank rules and regulations; that it did
not particularly describe the property to be seized; that he did not carefully
examine under oath the applicant and his witnesses; that articles not mentioned
were taken; and that thereafter the return and the inventory although appearing
to have been prepared on said date were not actually submitted to respondent
Judge until April 13, 1971 and the objects seized delivered only about a week
later on April 19.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was a lengthy and detailed answer submitted by respondent
Judge, the essence of which was substantial compliance with the requirements of
the Constitution and the Rules of Court, the procedure followed by him
conforming to the practice he found quite conducive to fruitful results in the
campaign against smuggling, resulting in intensified tax collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserted that he is legally and morally
convinced of his innocence of the charge of gross inefficiency, his actuations
being guided by the prescriptions of the Constitution and the rules or the
spirit thereof as well as the best interest of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then alleged that the application for the
search warrant was filed by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, Colonel <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>,
duly supported by the affidavit of one Romeo <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span>,
who was subjected to intensive examination and interrogation, the other
witness, one Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> de Vera of the
Philippine Constabulary, also being thus examined and interrogated, all three
of them describing with particularity and in detail the place to be searched
and the things to be seized; that the applicant and his witnesses arrived at
his place at about 10:30 p.m. and the warrant issued at 11:45, the promptness
with which he acted being due to the urgency of the matter; that there was only
one specific offense therein covered, namely robbery in band with the use of a
firearm then in the possession of the alleged leader Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, who had allegedly taken by force a treasure in the
form of a golden Buddha; that after the interrogation, he was convinced that
the offense of robbery in band was committed and that the Buddha had to be
seized before dawn as it would be taken out of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
and smuggled out of the country; that the delay in the delivery to the court
could be explained by the conclusion reached by him that from the angle of
security and safety, the articles seized should be kept and guarded by the CIS
agents at Camp Holmes, only a few kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>,
under tight security and personal responsibility of Colonel <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>;
and that as to those things taken or seized not covered by the warrant, the
persons aggrieved could file a motion for their return, his duty to act on<span style=""> the matter starting to commence only when it
is submitted judicially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Judge prayed that the complaint be dismissed for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complaint and the
answer were then referred for investigation, report and recommendation to the
then Associate, now Acting Presiding, Justice <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He conducted a thorough investigation and
thereafter submitted an exhaustive and comprehensive report on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31,
 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds alleged in the complaint to show
inefficiency he classified into the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first, the failure to follow the legal procedure by respondent Judge
when he issued the warrant; the second, the defects manifest on the face
thereof as two offenses were included and the description of the premises to be
searched and the objects to be seized being too general; the third, the absence
of a probable cause; and the fourth, the articles seized having included
objects not mentioned in the warrant and the delay in the delivery thereof to
respondent Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the first ground,
the failure to follow the legal procedure by respondent Judge when he issued
the warrant, Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> stated the following
in his Report: "There can be no question that from a reading of the
application for search warrant by Col. <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>, and
the affidavit by witness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span>, as well as
the search warrant itself, it can be deduced thatâ€”the deposition in writing of
Sgt. De Vera had not been taken contrary to </span>Sec. 4 of Rule 126; but
Investigator must agree with Defense that Respondent did examine under oath,
both applicant, Col. <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>, and witnesses, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span> and Sgt. De Vera; for Investigator notes that
complainant Secretary of Justice himself presented as his sole witness, Clerk
of Court, Fernando R. Romero, and this witness declared that, 'Q. Would you be
able to tell us more or less what sorts of questions were propounded by Judge
Marcos by way of interrogating these witnesses? A. I cannot repeat the words
because it was a long time ago, but if I may be permitted to make a gist I may
be able to relate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Q. </span>Please do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A. After administering the oath individually
to Col. <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span> and
de Vera, after giving their names and other personal circumstances, he dealt on
the questions "What were those articles that were the subject of the
application? And they described the articles, what I heard are a golden Buddha,
a rifle with some ammunitions." ' This being the case, Investigator is
bound to accept this testimony and must hold that outside of the literal defect
in that Respondent had not taken the written deposition of Sgt. de Vera, the
proceedings he had adopted were not fatally wrong; in fact, it might as well be
added that there is something very probable and therefore credible, in the
testimony of this witness that time was of the extreme essence, the urgency of
the situation could no longer permit further going back to the Office of the
Clerk of Court for renewed typing of application and affidavits and warrant, at
any rate, since it was complainant Secretary of Justice himself who presented
Clerk of Court Romero, he should be bound by latter's testimony; * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the second ground consisting of the warrant itself being defective
because it was issued for two offenses and the description of the premises to
be searched and the objects to be seized being too general, Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> discussed the matter thus: "Since the
warrant really stated that it was issued for, 'Illegal possession of firearms
and Violation of Central Bank Rules and Regulations,' and the body recited
that, 'Accused Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> illegally possess[<span class="SpellE">es</span>] firearms and ammunition without license or permit to
possess the same and a golden Buddha which he is keeping and concealing at his
premises at No. 47 <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City in violation of Central Bank Rules and Regulations; Investigator must
concur with complainant that this warrant violated Sec. 3 of Rule 126 which
provides that, 'No Search warrant shall issue for more than one specific
offense. 'Investigator must even add that the particular Central Bank circular
or regulation is not determined; as to the attack on the description of the
premises to be searched and the objects to be seized, what Investigator
understands is that the test of a good description for purposes of sufficiency
of the warrant is that it be one that would not permit seizure of the wrong
property, * * * indeed the very jurisprudence cited by Complainant * * * where
the search warrant described the objects as, 'books, documents, receipts,
lists, chits and other papers used by him in connection with his activities as money
lender charging a usurious rate of interest in violation of the law,' this
description was held to be good enough, the Supreme Court reasoning, 'Taking
into consideration the nature of the articles so described, it is clear that no
other more adequate and detailed description could be given, particularly
because <span style="">it </span>is difficult to give
a particular description of the contents thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The description so made substantially
complies with the legal provisions because the officer of the law who executed the
warrant was thereby placed in a position enabling him to identify the articles
in question, which he did,' * * * so that here, since certainly, no one would
be mistaken in identifying the Buddha, whose image is well known, and even the
firearms and ammunition because these were those without permit to possess, and
all located at No. <span style="">47 </span><span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, so far
as description was concerned, the search warrant perhaps could not be said to
have suffered fatal defects."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the third charge that the search warrant was issued without probable
cause, Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> started with the affidavit
of <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span> showing that "'on or about 6:30 a.m.
of March 31, 1971, I went to <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City and while I
passed by a house at No. 47 <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City I was attracted by several persons inside the
house; That I peeped from outside the house and when the curtain was moved I
saw a Buddha that was inside the house; That I observed what was going on
inside the house and I heard someone say that the golden Buddha was actually
for sale and when I observed them closer I overheard that it was being offered
for sale for 100, 000 pesos; That <span style="">I </span>peeped
again and I actually saw for myself again the Buddha and I heard one of the
persons inside whom I later found out to be Mr. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
that it was a golden Buddha but that a down payment was needed; That I am
executing this affidavit because I actually saw the Buddha and that I also saw
a firearm and some bullets inside the house.' * * * <span style="">which can easily sustain, contrary to complainant's position, that <span class="SpellE">Amansec's</span> knowledge was not hearsay at all; as to Sgt. De
Vera, it will be seen that </span>according to his testimony, 'Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>, did you seek the
coordination of the Police Force in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>?
A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not upon our arrival, but late in the
evening, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What else did you do between <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 a.m.</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 p.m.</st1:time> that same day, <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="4">April
 4, 1971</st1:date>, when you went to <span style="">see </span>Col. <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
conducted a survey and tried to find out and I found out that the Buddha <span class="GramE">is really existing</span> in the house of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, at <st1:street><st1:address>No. 47 <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were you able to pinpoint where the Buddha is?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yes, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to the place at
<st1:address><st1:street>No. 47 <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> Street</st1:street>,
 <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:city></st1:address> City to
determine that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did you find out?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span> it was really existing.' * <span style="">* * </span>from which investigator concludes
that Sgt. de Vera's knowledge neither was hearsay either; now complainant
point[ed] out * * * <span style="">certain alleged
discrepancies between the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span> and
his interrogation, * * * but perhaps, neither should it be overlooked that all
these if they existed at all were directed to the conscience of examining
Judge, who was the one called upon to grade their credibility, to act with
precision; the point is that while at the beginning the knowledge of witnesses
had come thru their information from their undercover men, the fact also was
that they were able to confirm the same with their own eyes, the existence of
the suspected articles within the premises, and that was what they certified
under interrogation, â€”from respondent, â€” as declared no less by complainant's
own witness, the Clerk of Court, Fernando R. Romero who was present
thereat."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As to the fourth accusation of gross
inefficiency, based on </span>the delay in the return as well as the delivery of
the objects seized, Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> did concur
"with complainant that the return was quite delayed; for in the words of
Sec. 11, Rule 126, the searching officer should forthwith deliver the seized
articles, yet, while search had been made on the night of 5 April, or better
stated, early morning of 6 April, 1971, the return was made only on 13 April,
1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the Buddha, it was stated in
the return that it was, 'under the control and custody of Government Security Agents
for safekeeping and will be turned over to this Honorable Court when directed
to do so.' * * * Now if it be remembered that Police Chief <span class="SpellE">Calano</span>
kept the Buddha in his residence in Camp Holmes, * * * for several days, that
provided the most fertile ground for suspicion of possible substitution;
however, Investigator will concede that the duty to make immediate return
devolved upon the searching party, perhaps a Judge cannot, considering that he
has other duties, be expected to immediately act and require immediate return;
perhaps, if there might and probably could be, danger of substitution, the
attention of the Judge should be immediately called to that, here it was not
ever, at least, there is nothing in the evidence to that effect; * * * However,
the searching officer's duty is to immediately return to the Court with the
seized articles; here the raiding party returned 7 days later, but without the
Buddha, although Investigator sees that on that date, 13 April, 1971, when the
return was made without the Buddha, respondent issued the order reading,
"In the 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated April 5, 1971
signed by the Acting Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, the
following articles were seized by virtue of Search Warrant No. 296 issued by
the underÂ­signed, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One <span style="">(1) </span>Buddha allegedly golden about 28
inches in height more or less; * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these articles were delivered to this Court, except the first item
which is 'one (1) Buddha allegedly golden about 28 inches in height more or
less.' To complete the record of search warrant No. 296, the Acting Chief of
Police is hereby ordered to deliver to this Office the 'one (1) Buddha
allegedly golden about 28 inches in height more or less.' [It is so
ordered].<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:city>City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
this 13th day of April, 1971. * * * <span style="">Although
not mentioned in the memorandum but mentioned in the complaint, is the fact
that articles not mentioned in the warrant, i.e., '1 old saber with scabbard,
and 14 pieces of <span class="SpellE">brassbars</span>, appearance similar to
gold bars.' </span>were seized * * * â€”as to this, respondent's answer that
Fiscal had the right to take action, as well as aggrieved person to file
corresponding pleading in court, * * * â€” this is correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, as to the delay in the return and
the seizure of other articles <span style="">not </span>mentioned
in the search warrant, Investigator must conclude that he can find no way to
blame respondent."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The conclusions reached
by Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span> follow: "From foregoing,
Investigator has come to the conclusions that Respondent:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1stâ€”Issued subject search warrant after
examining the witnesses as well as complainant thereof under oath, that the
examination sufficiently complied with the requirements as to the description
of the place to be searched and the object to be seized and that the knowledge
of the witnesses was not hearsay but on their own knowledge; however, insofar
as the fact that the written deposition of witness Sgt. De Vera was not taken
down and the same attached to the record, Respondent violated Sec. 4 of Rule
126; 2ndâ€”There was probable cause to issue the warrant; but the warrant itself suffered
of the defect that it was for two (2) offenses and one of these was not even
specified by stating with precision what Central Bank circular or regulation
had been infringed, contrary to Rule 126, Sec. 3; 3rdâ€”As to the delay in the
return, and as to the seizure of brass bars and a saber not mentioned in the
warrant, herein Investigator has not seen that Respondent should be made
liable."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came his recommendation: "In view whereof, while
Investigator believes that <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> defects in the
search warrant might perhaps have justified setting it aside on <i>certiorari</i>,
this being however an administrative case, maybe something more should have
been shown to justify punishment, for otherwise, all Judges whose orders are
assailed and annulled under the extraordinary legal remedies must be visited
with definite sanctions, ? something more should have been shown, some
partiality, bias, prejudice, wrongful motive, â€” but which Complainant has not
shown nor even attempted to show, and Investigator after some reflection having
come to believe that in the extreme urgency in which Respondent had found
himself, even other Judges, even Investigator himself, would have fallen into
the same mistakes, â€” therefore, he respectfully desists from recommending a
specific severe or even less than severe punishment, â€” this subject of course
to this Highest Court's other wiser criterion."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What immediately attracts attention in the above sentence of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan's</span> recommendation is the extreme
care he took to indicate that he is not to be understood as intruding in any
way with the full discretion that appropriately belongs to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reflects his high sense of <span class="SpellE"><u>delicadeza</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, it would appear obvious, considering the exhaustive report
and the language employed after his painsÂ­taking appraisal of the evidence of
record, that there is not <span style="">sufficient
warrant for any disciplinary action against respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he correctly pointed out, a <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding could have been availed of for corrective purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it must have been Justice <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan's</span> sense of realism fortified by long years of
service as a trial judge and possibly excessive modesty that did lead him to
say that he could have fallen into the same mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As was categorically
affirmed by retired Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
"To hold a judge administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling
or decision he renders, assuming that he has erred, would be nothing short of
harassment and would make his position unbearable."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nonetheless, it is not inappropriate to
place on record that a trial judge in the position of respondent ought to have
abided with the settled juristic norm that a search warrant should not be
issued for more than one offense and that the depositions of the witness should
be made in writing and thereafter attached to the record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">One

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as
found in the resolution sufficiently justify the complaint for gross
inefficiency filed by the complainant Secretary of Justice against respondent Judge,
arising from the latter's issuance at around midnight of April 4, 1971 of a
constitutionally-proscribed general search warrant that unlawfully covered more
than one offense and failed to particularly describe the property to be
seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>record</u> also does <u>not</u>
show that respondent Judge complied with the prescribed prerequisites for the
issuance of a search warrant of personally examining the complainant and
witnesses, taking their depositions in writing and attaching them to the
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, contrary to
standing instructions that such warrants except for compelling urgent reasons
should <span style="">be
served in </span>the daytime, the warrant was served and executed within two
hours of its issuance long before dawn (allegedly because the golden Buddha
subject thereof would be taken out of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and
smuggled out of the <span style="">country, </span>notwithstanding
that the house where it was kept was under close surveillance of the police and
constabulary); no receipt for the properties seized appears to have been issued
and the return of the warrant and delivery of the properties seized with an
inventory thereof were made to respondent judge not <span style="">forthwith </span>but only about two weeks
later on April 19, 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
seems quite </span>clear that Rule 126 on search and <span style="">seizure was thus violated in five </span>principal

<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> stressed two points in connection with the
constitutional mandate, "namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that no warrant shall issue but <u>upon probable cause</u>, to be
determined by the judge in the manner set forth in said provision; and (2) that
the warrant shall <u>particularly</u> describe the things to be seized."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There as in this case,
the implementing rule that "no search warrant shall issue for more than
one specific offense" was disregarded and violated and the warrants that
were issued were general warrants that <u>did no</u>t refer to any specific
offense or determinative provision of law alleged to have been violated (as
stated by the Investigator, the particular Central Bank circular or regulation
is not even determined) and did not particularly describe the properties to be
seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, in emphasizing that
such general warrants are outlawed and therefore may <u>not</u> be issued by
judges to whom the responsibility was at the time exclusively entrusted by the
Constitution (so that the determinaÂ­tion of the existence of probable cause for
the issuance of the warrant may be properly left to "a neutral and
detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often
competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">), held that "(T)o uphold the validity
of the warrants in question would be to wipe out completely one of the most
fundamental rights guaranteed in our Constitution, for it would place the
sanctity of the domicile and the privacy of communication and correspondence at
the mercy of the whims, caprice or passion of peace officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the evil sought to be
remedied by the constitutional provision above quoted -- to outlaw the
so-called general warrants." In unanimously adopting the exclusionary
rule, the Court recognized its salutary purpose -- to compel respect for the
constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way, by removing the
incentive to disregard it since otherwise "the ignoble shortcut to conviction
left open to the State tends to destroy the entire system of constitutional
restraints on which the liberties of the people rest."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court reaffirmed in <u>Asian
Surety &amp; Ins. Co. Inc. vs. Herrera</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in declaring void an outlawed general
warrant that was wrongfully served in "the wee hours of the morning",
that "(O)f all the rights of a citizen, few are of greater importance or
more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security,
and that involves the exemption of his private affairs, books, and papers from
the inspection and scrutiny of others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the power to search and seize is necessary to the public welfare,
still it must be exercised and the law enforced without transgressing the
constitutional rights of the citizens, for the enforcement of no statute is of
sufficient importance to justify indifference to the basic principles of
government." The Court once again stressed that the evident purpose and
intent of the constitutional mandate requiring a particular description in the
search warrant of the place to be searched and of the things to be seized is
"to leave the officers of the law with </span><u><span style="">no </span></u><u><span style="">discretion</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">regarding what articles
they shall seize, to the end that unreasonable searches and seizures' may not
be made."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In line with the
foregoing, judges of inferior courts who have been entrusted with this great
responsibility must be placed on notice that they will be held administratively
liable for disregard and breach of the Constitutional guaranty of immunity from
unreasonable searches and seizures and of the cited implementing rules of
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Art. III, sec. 1, par. 3, 1935 Constitution provides that: "(3) The rights
of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall
issue but upon probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination

<p class="FOOTNOTES">Art. IV, sec. 3, 1973 Constitution substantially reproduces
the text of the 1935 Constitution emphasizing the people's right against

other responsible officer as may be authorized by law." The text <span style="">reads:<span style="">&nbsp;
