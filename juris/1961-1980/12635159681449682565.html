				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The appellant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> was
prosecuted in the justice of the peace court (now municipal court) of <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union for qualified seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The criminal complaint, signed by the
offended woman Fe Castro and filed on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1961</st1:date>, charged</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the month of September, 1960, and for
sometime subsequent thereto, in the Municipality of San Juan, Province of La
Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously,
with grave abuse of confidence and authority, seduce and have sexual
intercourse with the offended par­ty Fe Castro, a domestic in the house of the
said accused, located at <span class="SpellE">Allangigan</span>, San Juan, La
Union, the offended party being then a virgin over 12 years but under 18 years
of age."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court, on November 27, 1962, found that
"the guilt of the accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt,"
and accordingly sentenced him to "an indeterminate pri­son term from four
(4) months of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor as maximum to two (2)
years and four (4) months of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> and to pay the costs." The accused was
further ordered "to pay the sum of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) as moral
damages to the offended party or to her parents."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> forthwith appealed to the
Court of Appeals which subsequently certified the case to us in a resolution
dated <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1965</st1:date>,
on the ground that the jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, is in issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following, in paraphrase, are the assigned errors:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace court of San
Fernando, La Union had no jurisdiction to try and decide this case because the
alleged offense was committed outside its territorial jurisdiction and at the
same time does not fall within the compass of its original jurisdiction;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in finding that the
accused had sexual intercourse with Fe Castro repeatedly and that he had told
her a number of times that he will separate from his wife Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Copio</span> and will marry her, which was the reason why Fe
Castro consented to the sexual intercourse;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in relying heavily on
the testimony of Fe Castro, considering that her testimony is hazy and
self-contradictory;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in totally disre­garding
the evidence adduced by the appellant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in failing to consider
in favor of the accused the delay in the filing of the complaint, which delay
is not convincingly explained and which renders the accusation suspi­cious; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in ordering the
appellant to pay the sum of P500 in moral damages to the offended party or to
her parents.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution discloses that in Sep­tember,
1960 Fe Castro, a fifteen-year old virgin, was brought by her mother to the
house of the appellant and his second wife, Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Copio</span>,
a sister of the complaining witness' mother, to serve as a helper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
spouses had been married for two years but were childless, although the
appellant had grown-up children by his first <span class="GramE">marriage who
were</span> domiciled elsewhere.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fe Castro testified that during her stay in the house of <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> for about three months from September to shortly
be­fore Christmas of December, 1960, the accused succeeded in having carnal
knowledge of her repeatedly, the total number of times she could not
recall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was certain, however, that
the accused consummated the first sexual intercourse with her one night in
September, about a week after her arrival, when the ac­cused intruded into her
bedroom, placed <span class="GramE">himself</span> on top of her and fondled her
nipples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She added that he was able to
gain ac­cess to her room because the wooden bar used to lock the door did not
prevent the said door from being opened when pushed from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also declared that prior to this <span class="GramE">incident,</span> the accused had made amorous overtures and
advances toward her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from giving
her money, the accused repeatedly promised to abandon his wife to live with
her.</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- You told us that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
had been giving you money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are there
other circumstances that led you to the sexual intercourse?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- He told me, ‘Come
now let us play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am go­ing to separate
your aunt because I love you more than my wife.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- For how many times had Mariano <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> been promising you this?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-He was telling me
all the time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Fe Castro farther testified that she subsequently repeated­ly
yielded to the carnal desires of the accused, as she was induced by his
promises of marriage and frightened by his acts of intimi­dation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused made love to her during the day
when his wife was away and at night when the latter was already asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their intimacies lasted for almost three
months until her aunt, the wife of the accused, caught them <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span> on the kitchen floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day she returned to her
parents, and revealed everything to her mother two days later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mariano <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>, testifying in his
defense, admitted that Fe Castro actually lived in his house from September to
De­cember, 1960, not as a helper, however, but in consideration of her being a
niece of his wife, and was treated as their own child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He vehemently denied having had carnal
knowledge of her, as there was never an occasion during which he could have
taken advantage of the chastity of his ward, because at night her room was
locked and during the day he was out in the farm.</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the offended party testified before the
Court she stated that the first time you had sexual intercourse with her was a
certain night in September and you said to her, 'You are very beautiful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Come let us play.' What do you say to this
allegation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- I did not do that,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- How is it possible
or will circumstances afford you of getting inside her room and take advantage
of her being a woman?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
No, sir.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Why could it not be that you could enter the room and take advantage of her
woman­hood?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
Because the room is locked."</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The offended party
further testified in Court that you did the sexual intercourse daily, one in
the day time and one in the nighttime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Will you mention before this Honorable Court if you can commit sexual
intercourse in the day time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- That cannot be,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Why could you not
possibly do the sexual in­tercourse in the day time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
Because I am in the farm, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Sometimes when you are
in the farm, during lunch time Fe <span class="GramE">Castro<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would</span> bring your food in the farm?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
No, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- And when you go
home to your house in the day time for example you take your lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is possible for you to have sexual
intercourse with the offended party?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
No, sir.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not possible
during day time.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Who are your companions in your house in the day time?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
My wife and also our neighbor who used to come."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> declared that another reason
why it was not pos­sible for him to seduce Fe Castro was that his sexual
capabilities had waned considerably because of old age, as he was already 52
years old at the time of the supposed commission of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that despite the fact that he had
been mar­ried for only two years to his second wife, he made love to her only
once a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
it was impossible for him to have indulged in sexual intercourse with Fe Castro
twice daily.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused advances the theory that the instant case was filed
against him upon the malevolent instigation of one <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, an uncle of Fe Castro, who wielded strong
influence over her, adding that the complainant herself was envious of his (<span class="SpellE">Fontanilla's</span>) children of the first marriage who received
some salary from their employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
allegation was indirectly corroborated by a witness for the defense, Mayor
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of San Juan, La Union, who testified
that he endeavored to settle the case by proposing that the accused pay P50
which was due to Fe Castro as her share in the cultivation of tobacco, but the
complaining witness through <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> refused the offer and the latter then insinuated
that the amount of P2,000 should be paid, which sum he believed would be
sufficient reparation for “the honor destroyed.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Copio</span>, 51-year old wife of
the accused, corro­borated her husband's statement that they indulged in sexual
intercourse only once a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also
stated that during the three months that Fe Castro stayed with them, there was
no unusual in­cident or sexual relation between her husband and her niece.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She denied having caught the accused in a
compromising situation with the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also testified that she slept regularly from <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 p.m.</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00</st1:time>
<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, after which she seldom could
go back to sleep, and that she was easily awakened by the slightest noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She categorically declared that her husband
slept with her in the same bed every night.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the first time on appeal, <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
challenges the jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> - the justice of
the peace court of San Fernando, the capital of La Union - alleging that it had
no jurisdiction to try and decide this case, for two reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the crime charged according to the
indictment was committed in San Juan, a municipality outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>; and (2) original jurisdiction
over the crime of qualified seduction belongs exclusively to the court of first
instance, and not to the justice of the peace court of the provincial capital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's theory finds no basis in the then governing
provisions of the Judiciary Act when the instant action was commenced on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule that the jurisdiction of
a court is determined by the statute in force at the time of the commencement
of the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The pertinent statutory provision then in force was section 87(c), paragraph 3,
of Republic Act 296, as amended by Republic Act 2613, which <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>
provided that "Justices of the peace in the capitals of provinces and
Judges of Municipal Courts shall have like juris­diction as the Court of First
Instance to try parties charged with an offense committed <u>within the
province</u> in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding three
thousand pesos or both. . ." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span>
supplied) It is therefore beyond dispute that under the then existing law all
offenses committed <u>within the province</u>, provided that the penalty
prescribed did not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> or a fine not exceeding P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> or both, were <span class="SpellE">triable</span> by the
justice of the peace courts of provincial capi­tals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the penalty prescribed for qualified
seduction under article 337 of the Revised Penal Code is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> in its minimum and medium
periods, the instant case was clearly within the periphery of the concurrent
jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="6">June 22,
 1963</st1:date>, more than two years after the institution of the case at bar,
that the above-cited provision of the Judiciary Act was amended by Republic Act
3828.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The per­tinent provision is now
section 87(c)<span class="GramE">,</span> paragraph 4, which, as amended, reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Municipal judges in the capitals of provin­ces and sub-provinces
and judges of city courts shall have like jurisdiction as the Court of First
Instance to try parties charged with an offense <u>committed within their
respective jurisdictions</u>, in which the penalty provided by law does not
exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or <u>fine not exceeding six
thousand</u> pesos or both. . ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Republic Act 3828 introduced two
significant changes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the concurrent
jurisdiction of municipal courts in the capitals of provinces and sub-provinces
and of city courts with the courts of first ins­tance has been territorially
localized and limited to the proper of­fenses committed "within their
respective jurisdiction,” while previously said courts could take cognizance of
the proper offenses committed "within the province;" and (2) the
proper offenses cognizable include those where the pecuniary (fine) does not
exceed P6,000, an increase over the previous P3,000 limit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first of the above-mentioned changes unmasks the fallacy of
the appellant's theory that even under the then existing provision, the
concurrent jurisdiction of the justice of the peace courts of provincial
capitals with the courts of first instance was already confined to their
respective territorial limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this
were true, then Congress would have had no reason to enact the foregoing
amendment which eliminated the phrase "within the province” and in its
place substituted the delimiting phrase "within their respective
jurisdictions.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing notwithstanding, the appellant insists that justice
of the peace courts of provincial capitals, like the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
have no jurisdiction over the crime of qualified seduction because of the
provisions of article 345 of the Revised Penal Code by virtue of which the
court must, in addition to the impo­sition of a prison term (<span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>correctional</u> minimum to medium in
case of qualified seduction) which the accused must suf­fer, require him to
indemnify the offended woman, to acknowledge the offspring unless the law
should prevent him from so doing, and in every case to support the offspring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of the appellant is that the
imposition of the enumerated civil liabilities increases the punishment,
thereby divesting the justice or the peace courts of the capitals of provinces
of jurisdiction and consequent­ly confining original and exclusive jurisdiction
over the offense to courts of first instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is obviously untenable because section 87(c),
paragraph 3 [now sec. 87(c), paragraph 4] of the Judiciary Act grants the
justice of the peace courts (now municipal courts) of provincial capitals
concurrent jurisdiction with courts of first instance over offenses for which
the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>correctional</u> or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding
P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> (now<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P6,000).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This concurrence of jurisdiction is based upon
the <u>duration of the imprisonment and/or of the amount of the fine imposable</u>,
irrespective of the civil incidents or obligations which may attach to the
offense charged. <span class="GramE">So that any civil liability attaching to the
offense concurrently cognizable by the courts of first instance and the justice
of peace courts provincial capitals can also be imposed by the latter because
these have been conferred jurisdictional parity.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant cites as authority for his theory the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Bernardo,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> a
seduction case in which this Court, with a slim majority of four justices
(three justices dissented), said:<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""></a></p>

<blockquote>“These obligations imposed upon the culprit ordinarily exceed the
amount of the penalty fixed by the law as being within the jurisdiction of the
justice of the peace court and comprise, moreover, by virtue of the forced
recognition imposed by article 135 of the Civil Code, the special determination
of the civil status of the offspring which resulted from the crime, conse­quently,
although the said crime of seduction is only punished by the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, a judgment of conviction
cannot be pronounced by a justice of the peace, on account of his lack of
jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But disregarding the amount of the indem­nity, whatever it
be, according to the conditions and circumstances of the offended party and of
the one obliged to furnish the same, which amount might be greater than that
fixed by law as within the jurisdiction of justice of the peace courts, the
acknowledgment of the resulting offspring, one of the findings which the
sentence must contain, es­tablishes by force of law the civil status of the
child whose acknowledgment is necessarily upon the guilty party; so with much
less reason could the crime fall within the jurisdiction of the justice of the
peace court, inasmuch as, in accordance with specific legal provisions, only
the judge of the Court of First Instance can make such pronouncements.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly contended by the Solicitor General, however, "there
is a big difference between the case of U.S. vs. Bernardo, <u>supra</u>, and
the present case, in that while the Bernardo case in­volved the original
exclusive jurisdiction of the justice of the peace courts, the present case
touches a concurrent jurisdiction of the justice of the peace courts in the
capitals of the provinces and Courts of First Instance.” Furthermore, “It would
be going a long way to say that an indemnification or <span class="GramE">a
restitution</span> or a repa­ration is a fine or an imprisonment under any
definition found in the criminal law of any country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the court is determined
by the amount of the fine and imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An indemnification or <span class="GramE">a reparation</span> or a
restitution is merely an inci­dent of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the court is not fixed by
the incident but by the nature of the crime itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legally speaking, the nature of the crime is
determined by the punishment imposed. . . . The jurisdiction of courts of
justice of the peace over crimes being determined exclusively by the amount of
the fine and impri­sonment imposed by law, that is by the legal nature of the
crime, and in no manner and to no extent whatever by the civil incidents which
accrue to the person injured by the commission of said crime, such courts have
jurisdiction of the crime presented in the case at bar, the punishment
prescribed by law for such crime being (then) simply <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<u>mayor</u>.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We now proceed to the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The atmosphere of secrecy and privacy which pervades the
commission of crimes against chastity, coupled with the con­sequent dearth or
even absence of witnesses, constrains the courts to rely in no small measure
upon the uncorroborated testimony of the complaining woman whose testimonial
and personal credibility assumes pivotal importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is against this situa­tional backdrop that
we proceed to discuss the issues of fact posed by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> contends, among others, that
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in finding there that there is evidence to
show that he had sexual intercourse many times with the complainant Fe
Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a thorough study of the record, we find
that the complainant's testimony, in direct as well as in cross-examination, is
entitled to essential credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
declared that <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had carnal knowledge of her
one night in September, 1960 in the house of the former where she was staying
as a maid, and that since then up to December of the same year, <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had sexual intercourse with her repeatedly,
sometimes at night, sometimes in the daytime, but always when his wife was
asleep or away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
convincing proof of the first sexual intercourse would suffice to affirm the
conviction of the appellant without necessity of proving the subsequent ins­tances
of carnal liaison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following frank
and revealing tes­timony of the offended woman appears on record:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When you were with
the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>, do you know if there was anything
unusual that took place?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimony of the aggrieved woman belies the
contention of <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> that there is no evidence
showing that he had carnal knowledge of Fe<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Castro.
Of course no other witness was presented by the prosecution to corroborate the
testimony of the victim with respect to the actual act of seduction, nor to the
amorous overtures of the accused before the first sexual intercourse, nor to
their subsequent carnal acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this
is quite understandable because aside from <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
and Fe Castro, there was only one other person in the house of the accused --
his wife, who was either asleep or away when the two indulged in their illicit
love-making.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously intimated,
the final verdict would principally hinge on the testimonial and personal
credibility of the complaining witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assailing the credibility of the complainant, <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
contends that Fe Castro had malevolent and ulterior motives for filing this
case against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that Fe
Castro was envious of his children by his first marriage who had some
income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our view, this is a flimsy
rationalization which the accused, significantly, did not even attempt to
substantiate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> also argues that Fe Castro
was induced and pressured by her uncle <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> to file the criminal complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying on this point, Mayor Antonio <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of San Juan, La Union, stated that he tried to
settle the case by propos­ing that the accused pay the complainant P50 as the
latter's alleged share in the tobacco harvest and that this proposal was re­fused,
however, by Fe Castro, thru <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, on the ground
that the amount offered would not even be sufficient to defray the ex­penses
for the delivery of the child which the victim mistakenly thought she was
conceiving as a result of <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla's</span> carnal know­ledge
of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
also claimed that <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> insinuated that any
compromise amount must be equal to the "honor destroyed" and he, <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, suggested P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimony was presented by the defense to prove its
allegation that Fe Castro was pressured into filing the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standing alone, <span class="SpellE">Gapasin's</span>
objection to the proposed compromise does not prove that he induced the victim
to de­nounce <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, from the actuations of <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> it can be inferred that he was just trying to
protect the interests of his niece who was offered so meager an amount as
settlement for an offense which caused the latter the irredeema­ble loss of her
virginity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is on record
that prior to the overtures at settlement, the complaining witness had al­ready
gone to the office of the provincial fiscal of La Union to file charges against
<span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> himself admitted upon cross-examination that he had
requested Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Crisogono</span> Bautista to postpone the
filing of the complaint to enable him to settle the case, and that the proposed
compromise was his idea and made upon his own initiative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This admission shows that the filing of the
instant case <span class="GramE">preceded</span>, and was not due to, the failure
of the alleged proposed compromise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further contends that the complainant's tes­timony
does not merit credence because it is hazy and self-contradictory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that if it is true that he
repeatedly pro­mised to marry Fe Castro in order to deceive her into submitting
to his carnal designs, why did the latter allegedly consent to the continuance
of their illicit liaison even after it was evident that he would not fulfill
his promise to marry her?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A situation
like <span class="GramE">this,</span> says the appellant, borders on the
incredible and suggests that there was actually no promise of marriage and
consequently there was no resultant carnal relation between him and the com­plaining
woman.</p>

<p class="BODY">This "unthinkable" situation pointed out by the
appellant was quite reasonably explained by the complainant in a frank, albeit
embarrassing, reply contained in her sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">A-1) taken in the office of the provincial fiscal of La Union
on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE">January
 31, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon interrogation, Fe Castro declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Despite his many
promises which he never fulfilled, why did you still continue to have
relationship with him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-
Because I was beginning to like him and enjoy this sexual intercourse."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Underscoring the above statement of Fe Castro, <span class="SpellE">Fonta­nilla</span> claims that it exposes in fact the fabricated
nature of the case against him, because for a woman to continue having sexual
relations with a man even after a patent breach of the latter's pro­mise of
marriage, is unthinkable and alien to human experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe, on the contrary, however, that
the said statement of the aggrieved woman does not make her testimony
incredible for it evinces basic honesty and sincerity on her part, even to the
extent of admitting something which could conceivably put her to shame and
ridicule.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the said marital promise, <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
also claims that there is no evidence on record supporting its veracity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grant­ing this to be correct, it is
nevertheless settled that deceit, although an essential element of ordinary or
simple seduction, does not need to be proved or established in a charge of
qualified seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is replaced by
abuse of confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the offender
is a public officer, a priest or minister, a servant, domestic, tu­tor,
teacher, or under any title is in charge of the education or keeping of the
offended woman, as in the present case, the act is punishable although fraud or
deceit may not have been used or, if employed, has not been proved.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The seduction of a virgin over twelve and under eighteen years of age,
committed by any of the persons enumerated in art. 337 "is constitutive of
the crime of qualified seduction . . . even though no deceit intervenes or even
when such carnal knowledge were voluntary on the part of the vir­gin, because
in such a case, the law takes for granted the exis­tence of the deceit as an
integral element of the said crime and punishes it with greater severity than
it does the simple seduc­tion . . . taking into account the abuse of confidence
on the part of the agent (culprit), an abuse of confidence which implies deceit
or fraud.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise contended for the appellant that the testimony of
the complainant is unbelievable because while she denounced the perverse and
criminal conduct of the accused, in the same breath she described the relation
between the accused and his wife as harmonious and cordial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged inconsistency in this re­gard is
more apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man could
hide his evil mo­tives and immoral conduct behind a deceptive facade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it stands to reason that a husband who
has illicit relations with a woman who resides in the same house where he
dwells with his wife would even be over-solicitous with the latter to
camouflage his infidelity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> also challenges the
credibility of Fe Castro's account regarding his having been discovered by his
wife in the act of sexual intercourse with the complainant on the kitchen
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that had such a
discovery actually been made, the natu­ral reaction of his wife would have been
to lay hands on both of them (Fe Castro and himself), with the complainant
taking the most punishment since women are inherently possessive and are merci­less
upon those who attempt to take away their loved ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fe Castro did not testify on such a hostile reaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are inclined to believe, however, that women are bound to
react differently to the same or similar situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no sufficient reason to discredit Fe
Castro's testimony that when they were discovered <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span>
by Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Copio</span>, the appellant's wife and her
aunt, the latter verbally chastised <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> for
hav­ing "fool(ed) this little girl."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's wife, then 51 years old and twice married, most
probably knew that it was her 52-year old second husband, the herein appellant,
who was at fault and thus spared her 15-year old niece from any punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that the testimony of Fe Castro suffers from some
inconsistencies; these, however, could be attributed to her minority (she was
barely 16 years old at the time of the trial), lack of education (she had
reached only grade III), perceptibly low in­telligence, and to the
understandable partiality of a litigant to her cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the whole, we find that the complainant's
testimony is credible and convincing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, we believe that no other reason impelled Fe Castro in
instituting this case against her very kin, and exposing thereby her sordid
experience to public scrutiny and suffering as a consequence the travail of
trial, than to seek justice for herself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further claims that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
erred in failing to consider the unexplained delay in the filing of the com­plaint,
which delay renders the accusation suspicious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is rele­vant to note that the accused did not raise this issue before
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anent the
alleged delay, the Solicitor General states that it can easily be explained
"by the fact that the complainant was not accusing a person who was a
total stranger to her but the husband of her mother's sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attempt of the older people to thresh out
their differences and to settle the case amicably had brought about the said
delay." It appears on record that Fe Cas­tro left the house of <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> on <st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1960</st1:date>, and two days thereafter she informed her parents of what <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith she and her parents decided to bring the case to court, and on
January 13, 1961 Fe Castro had herself examined in the La Union Provincial
Hospital, with the name of Fiscal Bautista appearing in the medical certificate
as the requesting officer, which means that prior to January 13, 1961 Fe Castro
had already gone to the office of the provincial fiscal presumably to complain
against <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The criminal complaint was filed only on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1961</st1:date> because as previously <span class="GramE">stated,</span>
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> had requested Fiscal Bautista to
postpone the filing of the indictment to give the former sufficient time to
attempt at an amicable set­tlement of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the basic defense set up by <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>,
which is a denial of his having had carnal knowledge of Fe Castro whom he
admits was once his ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His denial is
anchored on two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) there was
no occasion during which he could have violated the chastity of the complainant
because during the night the room of the latter was locked and during the day
he was al­ways out in the fields; and (2) at the age of 52, his sexual potency
had considerably waned as proved by the fact that he had sexual intercourse
with his own wife only once a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not accord credence to this defense, and we are
of the view that in this regard the court did not err.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant testified that the wooden bar which she used to
lock the door of her room did not prevent the said door from being opened when
pushed from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had easy access at night to Fe Castro's sleeping
quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the general
make-up of residential houses in the bar­rios, we believe that the
complainant's statement is essentially true.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the appellant's argument that during the day he
had no opportunity of being alone with the complainant, he himself admitted
upon cross-examination that there were times when he would be home earlier than
his wife and would ask Fe Castro to serve him food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no other person in the house
during such occasions Fe Castro and <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
naturally would be alone together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant also admitted that whenever his wife went to market she would be away
for two to three hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hastened to
add, however, that each time his wife left for the market she advised Fe Castro
to stay with their neigh­bor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting
that Fe Castro would really go to their neighbor's place which was only five
meters away from their house, it is not improbable that <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
would call her back once his wife had left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the very record of the case belies the defense of the appellant
that there was no occasion when he could have violated the chastity of his
ward.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also contends that it was impossible for him to
have indulged in sexual intercourse with the complainant twice a day, because
even with his wife he made love only once a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
attributed his diminished virility to old age as he was already 52 years old at
the time of the commission of the alleged crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This declaration was corroborated by his
wife, Magdale­na <span class="SpellE">Copio</span>, who went to the extent of
vouching <span class="GramE">that</span> two years after their marriage they did
not indulge anymore in sexual relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe, nonetheless, that the appellant's claim is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the complainant did not
say that <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had her twice a day during the
three months that she stayed with him and his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked what time they indulged in sexual
intercourse she replied "Day and night." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p.6) This answer of the complainant cannot be interpreted to mean that they had
sexual intercourse twice daily (one in the daytime and another at night), for
said statement was in reply to a question with respect to the <u>time</u> when
they engaged in carnal intercourse and not the <u>frequency</u> of their
illicit love making.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second
place, there is a presumption that an adult male has normal powers of virility
and the burden of proving the contrary rests on the party assert­ing it.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
We believe that the declarations of <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> and his
wife on the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> alleged weakening potency are
not sufficient to rebut this presumption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alfred W. Herzog has cautioned that "one must be very careful not
to express the opinion that a man on account of his age is either sterile or
impotent."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, a party who claims loss of virility, or waning potency for that mat­ter,
must bolster his assertion clinically with the aid of a compe­tent and expert
witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prosecution presented Dr. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> K. Guerrero, the physician at the La Union Provincial
Hospital who examined the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
Guerrero testified that the hymen of Fe Castro showed "incomplete healed
lacerations at 9 &amp; <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3 o'clock</st1:time>
positions on the face of a watch, edges of which are sharp and easily <span class="SpellE">coaptable</span>." He explained that <u>healed</u>
lacerations would suggest that the injury happened six months, more or less,
prior to the date of examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, since per medical findings the hymen of the complainant showed “<u>incomplete
healed</u> lacerations,” then this fact would indicate that the injury occurred
less than six months before February 12, 1961, the date of the medical
examination of Fe Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
said period corresponds to the time when Fe Castro stayed as a helper in the
house of the <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon cross-examination, Dr. Guerrero
testified:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Dr. Guerrero, you
stated that it (the laceration) should last less than six (6) months counting
from?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- From the time I
examined."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Disregarding the history of the patient,

intercourses because of the laxity of the vaginal canal and it admits three (3)
fingers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- How many

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is clear from the above testimony that
Fe Castro had expe­rienced numerous distinct acts of sexual intercourse, a fact
which affirms her claim that the appellant had carnal knowledge of her
repeatedly during her three-month stay in his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence on record that Fe
Castro, then a 15-year old single girl was unchaste prior to her living with
the <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, her virginity before she
was seduced by the appellant must be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Presumption of a woman's virgini­ty arises whenever it is shown that she
is single, and continues until overthrown by proof to the contrary.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This is in accord with the presumption of innocence which "includes, also,
that of morality and decency, and, as a consequence, of chastity.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the considered opinion that the findings of fact
reached by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> are substantially correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, apart from the rule that "as far
as credibility and veracity of witnesses are concerned, the conclusions of the
lower court command great weight and respect, on the ground that the
trustworthiness of wit­nesses and the merit of the defenses by the accused, are
in the peculiar domain of the trial court."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, we see no reason for departing from this doctrine, there
being no showing that "some fact or circumstance of great importance to
the case has been overlooked in the records or misapplied or its sig­nificance
misunderstood by the lower court."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant finally contends that the lower court erred in
ordering him to pay P500 in moral damages to the offended party or to her
parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, this contention is
correct in two respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is
that the award of P500 in moral da­mages is inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have heretofore stated that the com­plainant
was a virgin, there being no proof to the contrary, and that she was deflowered
by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loss of her virgi­nity,
at the hands of the appellant, together with the attendant shame and scandal,
entitles her, in the view of this Court, to the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,500</span>
in moral damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her future as a woman
is definitely impaired, and the resultant prejudice against her engendered in
the male population of the barrio where she resides cannot be blinked away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second error of the lower court is in
making the award payable to the offended party <u>or</u> to her pa­rents; which
award is, by the very wording of the judgment, in the alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2219 of the New Civil Code provides
that moral damages are recoverable by the offended party in the cases of "<u>seduction</u>,
abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts" and that the "parents of
the female <u>seduced</u>, abducted, raped, or abused . . . may also recover
moral damages." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied) The
conviction of the accused suffices as a basis to adjudge him, in the same
action, liable for an award of moral damages, without independent proof
thereof, to the victim <u>and</u> her parents, because the law presumes that
not only the woman who was seduced, ab­ducted, raped or abused, but as well her
parents, naturally suffer besmirched reputation, social humiliation, mental
anguish, and wounded feelings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, moral damages must be awarded to the offended woman <u>and</u> her
parents, not to either of them, as ordered by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with
the modification that the appellant is ordered to pay the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,500</span> in moral damages to the offended party and her
parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against
the appellant.</span></p>
