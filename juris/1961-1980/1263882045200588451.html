into believing that the accused in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No.
12028 were actually reporting to the court, strictly in accordance with the
provisions of the Laurel Law, when in truth and in fact, said accused were not
so reporting; intentionally not informing the court and the private prosecutor
despite the fact that the Presiding Judge told counsel in open court that the
accused were re­porting in accordance with law, that the excerpts she prepared
did not reflect the fact that the accused had not strictly complied with the
law;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

delaying the transcription of the stenographic notes in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. 12028, although the same is about to be terminated." <span class="GramE">(p. 2, Memo.)</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After respondent filed her answer, the matter was referred to
Judge Eduardo P. <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch VIII in Valenzuela, who
submitted the following report and recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>"For purposes of expediency and clarity, the undersigned
Investigator will take up first the charges against respondent Josefina <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span>, Court Stenographer of the Municipal Court of
Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first charge is as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Intentionally</span> misleading not only the <span class="SpellE">Mun</span>.
Court Judge but also <span class="GramE">an officer of the Court into believing
that the accused in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 12028 were
actually reporting with the court strictly in accordance with the provisions of
the Laurel Law, when in truth and in fact said <span style="">accused were</span></span><span style=""> not </span>so
reporting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That despite the fact that
the Presiding Judge in formed the counsel in open court that the accused were
reporting in accordance with law, respondent stenographer who prepared the
excerpts, intentionally did not inform the court and the private prosecutor
that the excerpts she prepared did not reflect that the accused had not
strictly complied with the law.'</p>

<blockquote>"The charge in this case is that, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span>
prepared an excerpt (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B and B-1) in Criminal
Case No. 12028 of the Municipal Court of Valenzuela of whether the various
accused in said case reported every two (2) weeks to the Clerk of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no accusation that the excerpt is
falsified or that it is incorrect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
charge <span class="GramE">is,</span> that the contents of the excerpt were not
brought to the attention of Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> when she submitted the excerpt to the Judge in
open court, and during the time the question of whether the accused were
reporting to the Clerk of Court was being ventilated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted, however, that there is no
duty imposed by law on the Municipal Court Stenographer to make this
excerpt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undisputed testimony of
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> is that, she prepared this excerpt
upon express order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That being the case there was no duty on her
part to call the attention of Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> as to the
contents of the excerpt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was up to
Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> and to the proper officer entrusted by
law to report to Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not pretended that it is the duty of
the Municipal Court Stenographer to make this report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact therefore that the Judge may have
been misled by the excerpt is not to be attributed to the Court Stenographer whose
only duty was purely mechanical, and that was to obey the order of the Judge by
preparing an excerpt of the report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is submitted therefore that this accusation was not
proven.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The second charge against Mrs. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Macalincag</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> is that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Intentionally
delayed the preparation of the stenographic notes in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. 12028, as a matter of fact up to the present there is still pending
transcription of proceedings in aforesaid case, despite the fact that the said
case is about to be terminated.'</p>

<blockquote>"The respondent in this case admitted having failed to give a
transcript of the testimony of complainant as requested by him although she
furnished complainant with a copy of the transcript of the testimonies of the
other witnesses (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">1-A to 1-K
and 2 to 2-J).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt
likewise that complainant demanded a copy of said transcript.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the failure of said stenographer to
furnish the copy must be seen in the light of the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">First</span></u><span style="">, </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span>
is the sole stenographer in the Municipal Court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">number of cases that are filed and calendared in the Municipal
Court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> are</span> very
numerous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact more than
ten (10) cases a day are calendared and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span>
attends hearings of the Municipal Court everyday, Monday through Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning, Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> takes down the proceedings of the hearings and
in the afternoon she takes down the orders of the Judge as well as takes down
his decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>, that when
witness Marcelo Pasco in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 12028
testified, Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> allowed <span class="GramE">counsel</span>
Atty. Viola to take down the testimony through a tape recorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span>
explained that her failure to submit the transcript was due to the fact that
she could not find any time to transcribe the same because of the load of her
work and, because of the fact that counsel Viola was given the privilege of
taking down the testimony of complainant through a tape recorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last reason given by Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> is of course not tenable, as only her
transcribed notes are the official report of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the load of work of the single
stenographer of the Municipal Court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
is such that really delay in the transcription of the testimony of a witness in
a case is not only the foreseeable result but the inevitable result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span>
has too much work for her to bear alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not her fault then that she cannot immediately give transcription
of notes inasmuch as she must give preference to the work of the Court as well
as the orders of the Judge and his decisions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is submitted therefore that there was no intentional
failure on the part of Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> to
furnish complainant <st1:city><st1:place>Pasco</st1:place></st1:city> with a
copy of the transcribed notes of his testimony but rather that the pressure of
work prevented the said stenographer from doing so.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>RECOMMENDATION</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The undersigned recommends that Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> be exonerated from the two (2) charges that were
lodged against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(pp. 48-51, Rec.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have reviewed the record and <span class="GramE">We</span> find
the foregoing report and recommendation to be fully supported by the evidence
We therefore approve the same <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Loreto Perfecto, clerk of court of the same
court is charged with:</p>

despite knowledge that accused in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case 12028
had previously failed to appear during the scheduled hearings, and could
therefore be considered as having jumped bail, respondent had failed to so
inform the municipal court Judge; hence, accused continued to enjoy provisional

posted in the Court wherein he is employed as Clerk of Court, or in other
courts in and around Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, without the

furnished with copies of said pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">These charges were denied by respondent in his <span class="GramE">answer,</span>
hence the case was also referred to Judge <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> for
investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp;

heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his report, the Investigator submits that the first, second,
third and fifth specifications under the first charge have not been proven, as
also the fourth charge, and with respect to the second charge, the same is
already covered by the fourth specification under the first charge, which
together with the third and fifth, he submits have been substantiated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have also gone over the records on which the portion of the
report of the Investigator pertinent to the above matters is based, and <span class="GramE">We</span> find no reason to alter his findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, putting aside the charges and
specifications which, as recommended by him should be deemed as not proved, <span class="GramE">We</span> further approve the Investigator's conclusions as
follows:</p>

to order respondent <span class="SpellE">Macalincag</span> to make an excerpt of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">'D', 'D-1' to 'D-10', indicating
the lack of knowledge of Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> of the

<span class="SpellE">aa</span>:- In that despite knowledge of prohibition,
respondent plays tennis even during office hours, to the prejudice of the
service.'</p>

<blockquote>"In support of this charge complainant testified that on <st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1974</st1:date> after his case was
postponed, he saw respondent Perfecto changing into tennis clothes in his room
and then left the court presumably to play tennis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, complainant did not actually see
respondent Perfecto playing tennis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on two (2) occasions, the dates of which he cannot specify,
complainant testified that he saw respondent Perfecto playing tennis doubles at
the municipal tennis court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason why complainant could not
particularize the dated was that he did not pay attention to respondent playing
tennis because he thought that the situation will not reach this far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, complainant categorically stated
that he saw respondent Perfecto playing tennis between <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> in
the morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent Perfecto denied this charge and in support of his
denial he presented as witness the caretaker of the municipal tennis court, one
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Nacorda</span>, who stated that he did not see the
respondent playing tennis during office hours and that the playing days of
respondent Perfecto were merely after office hours, on Wednesdays at 4:30 in
the afternoon and on Sundays from 7:00 in the morning. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This witness stated that nobody could play in
the tennis court without first fixing it with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on cross-examination this witness
admitted that if a person wanted to play tennis without first arranging matters
with him, such person could do so and witness will not know about it because in
that case witness would be arriving late at the tennis court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Perfecto likewise denied the
accusation that he played tennis during office hours and admitted only playing
tennis twice a week, on Wednesday after office hours and on Sunday, saying that
he could not play tennis on other days because he was prohibited by his doctor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fe de <span class="SpellE">Gucena</span>, the only witness of
the complainant other than himself, testified that she had filed a case in the
Municipal Court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and that when
she went back for the first time to inquire about her criminal case (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. I and I-1) respondent Perfecto was not in his office
and she saw him playing tennis at the municipal tennis court and this was
between <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> in the morning.</blockquote>

knowledge, he had failed to verify before receiving pleadings whether the
counsel of records (particularly in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No.

pleadings.'</p>

<blockquote>"In support of this charge complainant submitted Exhibits ‘H’,
'H-1' to 'H-17' showing pleadings prepared by the accused or their counsel and
copies of which were not furnished to the complainant or his lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Perfecto, however, explained that
in a memorandum marked as Exhibit '3', dated <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1973</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> of the Municipal Court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, specified the duties of the personnel of the
Office of the Clerk of Court of the Municipal Court of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
questioned as to why no particular duties were assigned to him, respondent
Perfecto testified that his duty was to supervise the whole personnel of the Office
of the Clerk of Court of the Municipal Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Perfecto likewise testified that Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano's</span>
instructions were to the effect that in case of motions to lift warrant of
arrest, the same should be submitted to him right away even without copy being
furnished to the other party because of the urgent nature of said motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise testified that on other pleadings
there were instructions to the clerk assigned to receive motions, namely, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> de Jesus, not to accept the same unless copy was
first furnished to the other party or his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibits 'H' to ‘H-17’ indubitably show,
however, that copies of said pleadings were not furnished to the complainant or
his lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore clear that
these exhibits were admitted by clerk <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> de
Jesus in violation of the instructions of Judge <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>,
as well as those of respondent Perfecto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it is likewise clear that respondent Perfecto did not see to it
that clerk <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> de Jesus complied with her
instructions, because these are more than 18 pleadings wherein the copies were
not furnished to the other party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
therefore submitted that respondent Perfecto was negligent in his supervisory
duty of seeing to it that his personnel followed properly instructions." <span class="GramE">(pp. 59-60, </span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">Id.</span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE">)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Stated otherwise, We find respondent guilty (1) of having
violated the civil service rules for having been playing tennis on two or three
occasions during office hours; (2) of having failed in his duty, as clerk of court,
to inform the presiding judge that the accused in Criminal Case No. 12028 had
not been reporting twice a week as required by the Laurel Law; and (3) of
laxity in the supervision of his subordinates resulting in several pleadings
being filed with the court without being accompanied by proper proof of service
upon the other party, which, under his own instructions to the clerk-in-charge,
<span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> de Jesus, should not have been received for
filing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, <span class="GramE">We</span> do not consider the
proven charges to be so serious as to require drastic action against
respondent, particularly, if it is considered that he has been in the service
for more than 22 years and this is the first time that any administrative
complaint has been filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, <span class="GramE">We</span> feel that a fine of equivalent
to respondent's salary for month and a strong reprimand, together with a
warning that any subsequent administrative fault on his part will be dealt with
more severely would suffice to serve the interests of the service.</p>

her, and, with respect to respondent Loreto Perfecto, he is hereby found guilty
