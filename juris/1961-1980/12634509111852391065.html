				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Corachea</span>, on <st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1960</st1:date>, was a passen­ger
in a taxicab owned and operated by <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Perez when
he was stabbed and killed by the driver, Simeon Valenzuela.</p>

<p class="BODY">Valenzuela was prosecuted for homicide in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Found guilty, he was sen­tenced to suffer imprisonment and to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal from said conviction was taken to the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="12">December <span style="">6, </span>1961</st1:date>, while appeal was
pending in the Court of Appeals, Antonia <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>,
Rogelio's mother, filed an action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> to recover damages from Perez and Valenzuela for
the death of her son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
asserted that the deceased was killed in self-defense, since he first assaulted
the dri­ver by stabbing him from behind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant Perez further claimed that the death was a <span class="SpellE"><u>caso</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>fortuito</u></span> for which the carrier was not liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, after trial, found for the
plaintiff and <span style="">awarded </span>her P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> as damages against defendant Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim against defendant Valenzuela was
dis­missed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this ruling, both
plaintiff and defendant Perez appealed to this Court, the former asking for
more damages and the latter insisting on non-liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sub­sequently, the Court of Appeals affirmed
the judgment of conviction earlier mentioned, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the herein appeal, and on <st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="5">May <span style="">19, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>final judgment was entered therein.
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. <span style="">33)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant-appellant relies solely on the ruling enunciated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gillaco</u></span><u> v. Manila Railroad Co</u>., 97 Phil. 884,
that the carrier is under no absolute liability for as­saults of its employees
upon the passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The atten­dant
facts and controlling law of that case and the one at bar are very different
however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Gillaco</u></span>
case, the passenger was killed outside the scope and the course of duty of the
guilty employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court there
found:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>when the crime took place, the guard <span class="SpellE">Devesa</span> had no duties to discharge in connec­tion with the
transportation of the deceased from <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> to </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Manila</u></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulation of <span style="">facts is clear that when <span class="SpellE">Devesa</span> shot and
killed <span class="SpellE">Gillaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Devesa</span> was
assigned to guard the Ma­nila-San Fernando (La Union) trains, and he was at <span class="SpellE">Paco</span> Station awaiting transportation to <span class="SpellE">Tutuban</span>,
the starting point of the train that he was engaged to guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, his tour of duty was to start at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9"><span style="">9:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">, </span><span style="">two hours <u>af­ter</u> the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Devesa</u></span><u>
was therefore under no obligation to safeguard the passengers of the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>-Manila train, where the deceased was riding; and
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Gillaco</span> was not done in line of duty</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The po­sition of <span class="SpellE">Devesa</span>
at <span style="">the time was that of ano­ther would
be passenger, a stranger also await­ing transportation, and not that of an
employee assigned to discharge any of the duties that the Railroad had assumed
by its contract with the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, <span class="SpellE">Devesa's</span> assault can not be deemed </span>in
law a <span style="">breach of <span class="SpellE">Gillaco's</span>
con­tract of transportation by a servant or emplo­yee of the carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Now here, the killing was perpetrated by
the driver of the very cab transporting the passenger, in whose hands the
carrier had entrusted the duty of executing the con­tract of carriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, unlike the <span class="SpellE"><u>Gillaco</u></span> case, the killing of the passenger here took
place in the course of duty of the guilty employee and when the employee was
acting within the scope of his duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Gillaco</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>case
was decided under the provisions of the Civil Code of 1889 which, unlike the
present Civil Code, did not impose upon common carriers absolute liability for
the safety of passengers against willful assaults or negligent acts committed
by their employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The death of the
passenger in the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Gillaco</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>case was truly a fortuitous event
which exempted the carrier from liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that Art. 1105 of the old Ci<span style="">vil Code on fortuitous events has been substantially re­produced in
Art. 1174 of the Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philip­pines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> but both articles clearly remove from their
exempt­ing effect the case where the law expressly provides for liability <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the occurrence of force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And herein significantly <span class="GramE">lies</span>
the statutory difference between the old and present Civil Codes, in the
backdrop of the factual situation before Us, which further ac­counts for a
different result in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Gillaco</u></span> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Un­like the old Civil Code, the new Civil
Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Phi­lippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> expressly makes the common carrier liable
for intentional assaults committed by its employees upon its passengers, by the
wording of Art. </span>1759 <span style="">which
categori­cally states that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Common carriers are liable for the
death of or injuries to passengers through the negligence or <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> acts of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> emplo­yees,
although such employees may have acted beyond the scope of their authority or
in vio­lation of the orders of the common carriers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Code provisions on the subject of Common Carriers<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
are new and were taken from Anglo-American Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There, the basis of the carrier's liability for assaults on passengers
committed by its drivers rests either on (1) the doctrine of <u>respondent</u> <u>superior</u>
or (2) the principle that it is the carrier's <u>implied</u> <u>duty</u> to
transport the passenger safely.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first, which is the minority view, the carrier is
liable only when the act of the employee is within the scope of his authority
and duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>is not sufficient <span style="">that
</span>the act be within the course of employment only.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second view, upheld by the majority and also by the
later cases, it is enough that the assault happens within the course of the
employee's duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no defense for
the carrier that the act was done in ex­cess of authority or in disobedience of
the carrier's orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The carrier's liability here is absolute in <span style="">the sense that it practically secures the passengers from assaults
committed by its own employees.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As can be gleaned from Art.</span> 1759, the
Civil Code of the Philippines evidently follows the rule based on the <span style="">second view.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At </span>least three very cogent reasons under­lie this rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As explained in <u><span style="">Texas Midland R.R. v. </span>Monroe</u>, 110 Tex. 97, <span style="">216 S.W. 388, 389-390, </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Haver</span></u></span><u><span style=""> v. </span>Central </u><u><span style="">Railroad </span>Co</u>., <span style="">43 LRA </span>84, 85: (1) the special un­dertaking
of the carrier requires that it furnish its passenger that full measure of
protection afforded by the exercise of the high degree of care prescribed by the
law, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> from violence and
insults <span style="">at the hands of strangers</span>
and other passengers, but above all, from the acts of the carrier's own
servants charged with the passenger's safety; <span style="">(2) </span>said liability of the car­rier for the servant's violation
of duty to passengers, is the result of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
confiding in the servant's hands the performance of his contract to safely
trans­port the passenger, delegating therewith the duty of pro­tecting the
passenger with the utmost care prescribed by law; and (3) as between the
carrier and the passenger, the former must bear the risk of wrongful acts or
negli­gence of the carrier's employees against passengers, since it, and not
the passengers, has power to select and re­move them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, it is the carrier's strict obligation to select its
drivers and similar employees with due re­gard not only to their technical
competence and physical ability, but also, no less important, to their total
per­sonality, including their patterns of behavior, moral fi­bers, and social
attitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying this stringent norm to the facts in this case,
therefore, the lower court rightly adjudged the defendant carrier liable
pursuant to Art. <span class="GramE">1759 of the Civil Code.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of the claim against the de­fendant
driver <span style="">was </span>also correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's action was predicated on breach
of contract of carriage<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and the cab driver was not <span style="">a </span>party
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His </span>civil liability is covered in the criminal case wherein he
was convicted by final judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the award of damages, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>granted only <span style="">P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> </span>to plaintiff-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This i<span style="">s
</span>the minimum compensatory damages amount recoverable under Art. <span class="GramE"><span style="">1764 </span>in connection
with Art.</span> <span class="GramE"><span style="">2206
</span>of the Ci­vil Code when <span style="">a </span>breach
of contract results in the passenger's death.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been the policy followed by this
Court, this minimal award should be increased to <span style="">P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>As to other alleged actual damages, the lower court's finding
that plaintiff's evidence thereon was not convincing,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
should not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Still, Arts.</span> <span style="">2206 </span>and
<span style="">1764 </span>award <u>moral</u> damages
in addition to compensatory damages, to the parents of the passenger killed to
compen­sate for the mental anguish they suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A claim <span class="SpellE">there­for</span>
having been properly made, it becomes the court's duty to award moral damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Plaintiff demands P5,000 as moral damages; however, in the circumstances, We
con­sider P3,000 moral damages, in addition to the P<span style="">6</span>,000 da­mages afore-stated, as sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Interest upon such damages
are</span> also due to plaintiff-appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification increasing the award of
actual damages in plaintiff's favor to P6,000, plus P3,000 moral damages, with
legal interest on both from the filing of the complaint on December <span style="">6, </span><span style="">1961 </span>un­til the whole amount is paid, the judgment appealed from
is affirmed in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>
