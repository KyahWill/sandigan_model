<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In Civil Case No. 1636 of the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Domingo Bautista 
obtained a judgment against the Philippine Ready Mix Concrete Company, Inc. in 
the amount of P104.000.00 (should be P100,000.00) of which the company only paid 
the sum of P54,000.00 leaving a balance of P46.000.00. To effect payment of this 
balance writs of garnishment were served on different persons one of whom was 
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in his capacity as <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> of an Osgood shovel crane belonging to the 
Philippine Ready Mix Concrete Company, Inc. ordering <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> to pay to the Sheriff of Manila instead of said 
company all the rentals that may accrue under the lease in favor of the latter. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From May 6 to May 27, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> made several payments in the aggregate amount of P1 
,800.00 to Bautista in obedience to the writ of garnishment served upon him, 
refused to make any further payment on the strength of an agreement he had with 
Bautista that upon the Payment of said amount he would no longer molest him. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On February 10, 1954, in the same 
Case No. 1636, on Motion of Bautista, the court <i>a quo</i> issued an order 
declaring <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in contempt of court and ordering 
his arrest unless he pays either to Bautista or to the court the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> being the rentals that allegedly accrued when the 
writ of garnishment was served upon him. On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="19" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 
19, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> appealed the order to the Court of Appeals and 
in order to stay its effect pending appeal, he filed a bond in the sum of 
P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which was subscribed by the State Bonding and 
Insurance Company, Inc. The appeal was found to be meritorious and the Court of 
Appeals set aside the aforesaid order reserving to Bautista whatever action he 
may desire to take to enforce any indebtedness that may still be due him. And 
acting conformably to this reservation, Bautista commenced the present action 
before the same court on May 31, 1958 <span class="SpellE">impleading</span> Jose 
M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and the State Bonding and Insurance 
Company, Inc. based not only on the liability assumed by the former under the 
writ of garnishment served on him in Civil Case No. 1036, but on the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond subscribed by the latter to stay the order 
of arrest issued against <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> when the latter 
appealed from said order to the Court of Appeals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After the parties had submitted a 
stipulation of facts on the strength of which they submitted the case for 
decision, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="18" month="2"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 18, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
dismissing the complaint against both defendants for lack of merit. Whereupon, 
plaintiff took the present appeal which was certified to us on the ground that 
the only questions involved are of law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In dismissing the case against 
defendant Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> the court <i>a quo</i> took 
the view that he could not be <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> on the basis 
of the judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 1630 for the reason that he was not a 
party therein upon the theory "that an action on the judgment cannot be 
maintained against one not a party or not bound by it." Thus, the court <i>a 
quo</i> said on this point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The procedure taken by the 
plaintiff in going after defendant <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> on the 
judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 1636 is, in the opinion of the Court, not 
the proper one as defendant <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> was never a party 
in the afore-mentioned case, and it is elementary that an action on the judgment 
cannot be maintained against one not a party or not bound by 
it."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While it is true that defendant 
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> was not a party in Civil Case No. 1636 
when it was instituted by appellant against the Philippine Ready Max Concrete 
Company, Inc., however, jurisdiction was acquired over him by the court and he 
became a virtual party to the case when, after final judgment was rendered in 
said case against the company, the sheriff served upon him a writ of garnishment 
in behalf of appellant. Thus, as held by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Land Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Sharruf</span>, 
41 Phil., 382, "the proceeding by garnishment is a species of attachment for 
reaching credits belonging to the judgment debtor and owing to him from a 
stranger to the litigation. By means of the citation, the stranger <i>becomes a 
forced <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span></i>; and the court, having acquired 
jurisdiction over him by means of the citation, requires him to pay his debt, 
not to his former creditor, but to the new creditor, who is creditor in the main 
litigation." Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> herein not on the basis of any liability assumed 
by him under the judgment rendered in said case but rather on the strength of 
the writ of garnishment served upon him because of his liability to a party 
whose indebtedness was then the subject of execution. There is, therefore, merit 
in the complaint filed against <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and, hence, the 
court <i>a quo</i> erred in dismissing it merely on a matter of procedure. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The situation is different with 
regard lo </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">defendant</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">State</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Bonding and Insurance Company, 
Inc. which was absolved from liability by the court <i>a quo</i>. It should be 
recalled that when <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> appealed the order for his 
arrest unless he pays the .sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to the 
Court of Appeals he put up a bond to stay the order pending appeal which was 
subscribed by the State Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc, The liability of 
this company was expressed in the contract as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The condition of this obligation 
is such that if the appeal of Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> be 
decided against him and he abides by and performs, the judgment or order, then 
this bond shall be null and void; otherwise, it shall remain in full force and 
effect."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And in absolving the company, the 
court a quo made the following comment: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The above cited <span class="GramE">provisions of the bond indubitably shows</span> that defendant 
company's liability Is predicted on the happening of two events: (1) that the 
appeal is decided against defendant <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and (2) 
that defendant <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> dots not abide by and perform 
the judgment or comply with the same. This moans that even if the appeal were 
decided against <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and the latter complies with 
the judgment, the bonding company would still be free from liability. In the 
present case, the appeal was decided in favor of <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, thus it becomes indubitable that the principal 
condition of the contract that is an adverse judgment against <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> will not happen and such being so therefore the 
liability of defendant had been extinguished."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find no flaw in the foregoing 
finding since it appears that the liability of the bondsman is predicated upon 
the condition that the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> be decided 
against him and the decision was in his favor. Hence, by the very wording of the 
bond, because of the non-fulfillment of the condition, the same became null and 
void and without effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from 
insofar as the State Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. is hereby affirmed. The 
decision insofar as defendant Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> is 
concerned is hereby reversed. The case is remanded to the court a quo with the 
directive that it decides the case with regard to <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> on the merits. No pronouncement as to costs. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
