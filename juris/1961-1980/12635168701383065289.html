				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">To sustain the plea of petitioner Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc.
in this petition for the review of a decision of respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission would be to reverse without any justification the
controlling doctrine on the adverse consequences of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
on the part of the employer, one so continuously and uninterruptedly adhered
to, and for good and sufficient reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not disposed to take that stand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We <span class="GramE">sustain</span> the award of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission in favor of respondent Louise <span class="SpellE">Mateu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision of respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission
of August 5, 1965, now sought to be reviewed, the facts were narrated
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Claimant Louise <span class="SpellE">Mateu</span> had filed on January 27, 1965 with the Regional
Office No. IV, through the Bureau of Workmen's Compensation, her Notice of
Inquiry or Sickness and Claim for Compensation dated January 22, 1965,
Physician's Report of Sickness or Accident dated October 26, 1964, signed by
Dr. Clarence <span class="SpellE">Ekvall</span>, Manila Sanitarium and Hospital,
and a certificate of the same physician dated November 13, 1964 stating among
other things, that she is an employee of the Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc.,
as time worker, with the regular occupation as Passenger Sales Agent, earning a
daily wage of P26.31 with 5 working days a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1948, while stationed in Tokyo,
Japan, she allegedly met a car accident in the company car while going from the
airport to their staff house, and since then her right shoulder and arm have
been bothering her, causing her temporary total disability for labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 29, 1957, claimant again sustained an
injury when the aircraft she was riding on suddenly lost altitude between
Okinawa and Tokyo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last September 8,
1964, she was again disabled for work until November 1, 1964, caused by pain in
her right shoulder, the same shoulder which had been injured several years
back, which has been diagnosed as:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Biceps <span class="SpellE">tendonities</span>, right; <span class="SpellE">Fibrositis</span>, right shoulder girdle <span class="SpellE">masculature</span>.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A regional officer of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
furnished petitioner Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc. her notice of injury or
sickness and claim for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a reservation on the part of the American Foreign Insurance
Associations on behalf of petitioner of its right to <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
pending investigation of the circumstance of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was shown, however, that not only was such
reservation made out of time but nothing else was done on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, it was the view of
respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission that as there was an admission
that the injury was work-connected and there was a failure to controvert, the
award made by the referee, <span class="GramE">which</span> moreover was
supported by substantial evidence, should not be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this petition for
review.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first assigned error can easily be disposed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would dispute a finding of fact of the
respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission as to the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
having been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an effort cannot
be attended with success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only recently,
in the case of <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. v.
Workmen's Compensation Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
we had occasion to reiterate that findings of facts based on substantial
evidence of record are not for us to disregard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are binding and conclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next two errors assigned would raise a due process question
in view of the alleged failure to accord petitioner its day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above-cited <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co. decision reiterates that in the absence of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
the due process argument is not likely to prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It quoted Filipino Pipe &amp; Foundry Corp.
v. <span style="">Workmen's Compensation Commission,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where this Court, speaking through the
present Chief Justice, stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It
is not denied that petitioner's answer to <span class="SpellE">Hiwatig's</span>
claim had not been filed within ten (10) days from notice of <span class="SpellE">Hiwatig's</span> claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to section 45 of Act No. 3428, petitioner is deemed, therefore,
to have renounced its right to controvert said claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the same was deemed admitted
by petitioner, which, accordingly, had no more right to demand a day in
court." Petitioner Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc. cannot, therefore, take
any comfort in the above assigned errors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the fourth assigned error objecting to the late filing of
the claim any more persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again to
quote from the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co. decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Failure to controvert amounts to a
waiver or renunciation or forfeiture or loss of right of the defense that the
claim for compensation was not filed within the statutory period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is undeniable is that 'the failure to
controvert is fatal to its defense of the claim having been filed out of
time.'"</p>

<p class="BODY">An excerpt from <st1:place>Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span></st1:place>
de Don Pedro v. Workmen's Compensation Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
is likewise relevant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"With regard to the claim that the delay
in filing the claim for compensation should be considered fatal to its success,
appellant corporation seems to have taken no notice of the fact that the
original ruling to that effect has suffered a gradual evolution, and that the
trend of the more recent decisions of this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Court has been to consider the delay a non-jurisdictional defect, unless
it is shown that the employer has been prejudiced thereby * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This trend conforms to the need of protecting
the workman whose inferiority <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the employer
has always been marked by disadvantage (Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Article 24)."</p>
