				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for <i>certiorari</i> - filed by the People of
the Philippines - seeking to <span style="">annul </span>the
order of dismissal as well as the subsequent order denying the motion for
reconsideration <span style="">thereof issued by the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> in its Criminal Case
No. 4220 - commenced therein by an <u>Information</u> filed by the Assistant
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City against private respond­ent
for alleged violation of the Revised Election Code - which said court based on
the ground that under Section 187 of the said Code, courts of </span>first
instance have exclusive original jurisdiction to make preliminary
investigations, issue warrants of ar­rest and try and decide any criminal
action or proceed­ing for violations of the election law and, therefore, the
proceeding undertaken by the above-mentioned as­sistant city fiscal in
conducting his own preliminary investigation of <span style="">the </span>charge and in subsequently filing the corresponding
Information with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="">, </span>being without authority of law, the only jurisdiction the said
court thereby acquired was to declare the said proceeding illegal and dismiss
the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following antecedent facts of the case are gleaned from the
pleadings of the parties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime
before March 25, 1966, the Office of the Election Re­gistrar of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City lodged with the Office of the Fiscal of said
city, a complaint against private re­spondent for alleged violation of Section
92 of Repub­lic Act No. 180, as amended, otherwise known as the Revised
Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Assistant City
Fis­cal Sergio <span class="SpellE">Pestaño</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
conducted a preliminary investigation of the indictment wherein the ac­cused
(private respondent), through counsel, volunta­rily appeared and cross-examined
the witnesses for the prosecution (Memorandum for Petitioner, pp. <span style="">48</span>-<span style="">49, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Convinced after the termination of the preli­minary
investigation that a prima facie case existed against said respondent, on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1966</st1:date>, the above-named
assistant city fiscal filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> the corresponding Information, worded as follows:</p>

accused, without any autho­rity or permission to enter and participate in the
registration proceedings then being conducted by the Board <span style="">of Election Inspectors of Precinct No. 74 of
this City, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously enter the
polling place of said precinct and while there shouted, insulted, berated, and
threatened one <span class="SpellE">Editha</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonat</span>,

- P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To prevent his subsequent arrest and detention, private
respondent seasonably posted a bail bond in the amount of P3,000.00; when
called for arraignment o<span style="">n </span>April
1, 1966, however, he moved to quash the Information and all the proceedings had
in the case on the ground that Assistant City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Pestaño</span>
had no legal authority to file the Information above-quoted; and acting upon
that motion to quash, the respondent judge of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
issued, on even date, an order quashing the Information and dismissing the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said order of dismissal, His
Honor reasoned thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> <span class="SpellE">Roblete</span> was made defendant in a charge of violation of
Section 92 of the Re­vised Election Code (RA-180, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge was filed with the Office of the
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assistant City <span style="">Fis­</span>cal Sergio <span class="SpellE">Pestaño</span>
conducted the preliminary investigation thereon in accordance with section 24,
RA-603, <span style="">in </span>relation
to Rule 112, Rules of Court; after which he filed the within information on
March 25, 1966, charging said <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> <span class="SpellE">Roblete</span> with violation of the Revised Elec­tion Code; and
which information is now the subject of said defendant's motion to quash on the
ground that the said information was filed by Assistant City Fiscal Sergio <span class="SpellE">Pestaño</span> without proper authority to do so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In regard to cases involving election offenses, the Court of
First Instance has exclusive original juris­diction to make preliminary investi­gations,
issue warrants of arrest and try and decide any criminal action or proceeding
for violation of the election law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Section 187, RA-180, as <span style="">amended.)</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the prosecuting City Fiscal herein conducted the
preliminary in­vestigation and pursuant to the same he filed the within
information, he acted plainly without jurisdiction and all his actuations in
the said proceeding were done <span style="">by him </span>without
authority of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jurisdiction is conferred by law and not by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It remains where the law has placed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the law has placed the conducting of
preliminary investigations of <span style="">election </span>offenses
under the <u>exclusive original jurisdiction</u><span style=""> </span><span style="">of the </span>Court of
First In<span style="">stance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the language of the law, no other courts
or officers may exer­cise the power and authority to conduct preliminary
investigations of such cases.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The proceeding in question having been conducted obviously
without authority of law, <span style="">the only </span>jurisdiction
acquired by this Court is to declare it illegal and dismiss this action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the entire proceeding leading to the filing of the
within <span style="">information </span>is hereby
quashed and this case dismissed with costs <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bail bond posted for the accused herein
is hereby cancelled and dis­charged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the order of
dismissal above-quoted, pointing out in its motion that respondent judge should
not have ordered <span style="">the outright dismissal
of </span>the case but should have <span style="">conducted,
instead, his own preliminary investiga­tion on the basis of the Information
filed with his court (Memorandum for Respondent, p. 41 - last para­graph - <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion
failed to move </span><span style="">the trial court
which, in an </span><span style="">order dated </span><st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3,
 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, denied the
motion </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">reconsideration referred to for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the ruling of the respondent <span style="">judge </span>that only his court, to the exclusion of the City Fiscal,
had authority to conduct preliminary investigations is unassailable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tagayuma</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lastrilla</span>, et al., L-17501, August 30, 1962, 5
SCRA 937, 940-942; Sec, 187, Rule 180, Revised Election Code, as amended).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances of this case,
however, it was an abusive resort to technicality for the said respondent judge
to have dismissed the criminal case outright merely because, before it was
filed with him, the fiscal had, perhaps in an excess of caution, con­ducted a
preliminary investigation of his own, which was unnecessary since, anyway, such
preliminary investigation could not have, in law, finally terminat­ed the
matter either way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As suggested by the
fiscal in his motion for reconsideration filed with the respondent judge, the
simple remedy was for the court to have conducted its own preliminary
investigation without regard to the one undertaken by the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the respondent judge acceded, as he
should have done, to said suggestion, the valuable time and effort of everyone
concerned, including this Court, could have been saved and the merits of the
complainant's charge, affecting as it does an alleged viola­tion of the
Election Law which public interest requires to be settled as soon as possible,
could have been determined and the public interest as well as the interests of
justice would have been best served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
question, the herein petition must be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are incidental issues extant in the plead­ings, among them,
the propriety of the present remedy of <i>certiorari</i> instead of appeal,
particularly, be­cause there is no allegation of grave abuse of discretion <span style="">in </span>the
petition, and the matter of waiver by the accused, respondent <span class="SpellE">Roblete</span>, of his right to the preliminary investigation
provided by Section 187 of the Revised Election Code, even if it is therein spe­cified
that it should be the proper court of first instance that should conduct it,
said accused having voluntarily appeared in the investigation in the <span class="SpellE">fis­cal's</span> office and cross-examined the witnesses of the
prosecution and also filed bail for his provisional release, but We do not see
the necessity of passing upon them now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to say, in connection with the nature of the present remedy,
that grave abuse of discretion is apparent in the recital of facts in the
petition and an allegation regarding such abuse <span style="">is </span>no more than a legal conclusion
which generally need not be alleged in a pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, since in the climate of waning faith
that prevails these days re­garding the efficacy of our election laws and proce­dures
in eradicating malpractices frustrating the popular will, <i>certiorari</i>
instead of appeal would seem to be the more speedy and adequate remedy, in
appro­priate cases like the one at bar, if only to <span class="SpellE">dispell</span>
as quickly as possible any doubt about alleged viola­tions of the right of
suffrage and the laws governing the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may add, for clarification, that in election cases, the
criminal prosecution may be initiated by filing either a criminal complaint
subscribed and sworn to by the offended party, any peace officer or any duly
authorized representative of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (sec. 2,
Rule 110) or an information signed by the fiscal, who need not necessarily
conduct the preliminary investigation since pursuant to Sec. 14 of Rule 112, a
fiscal may file an information even without conducting a prelimi­nary
investigation when such investigation is required by law to be undertaken by a
judge or another officer.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed orders are reversed, and the
respondent court is ordered to proceed consistently with the above opinions,
without costs.</p>
