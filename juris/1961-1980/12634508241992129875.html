<p class="NUM">1. On July 3, 1965, a petition for mandamus and certiorari with preliminary
injunction was filed by <span class="SpellE">Au­yong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
(Hong <span class="SpellE">Whua</span> Hang) against Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Clo­ribel</span> of Branch VI of the Court of First Instance
of Manila, the Consolidated Tobacco Industries of the Phil­ippines, Inc.
(hereafter referred to as CTIP), the Col­lector of Customs, the Commissioner of
Customs and the Consolidated Tobacco Terminals, Inc., praying, among
others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) for a writ of certiorari
declaring the order of respondent Judge of June 9, 1965 in Civil Case No. 59344
of the Court of First Instance of Manila illegal and without force and effect;
(b) for a writ of mandamus directing respondent Judge to dismiss Civil Case No.
59344 of the Court of First Instance of Manila; and (c) to direct respondent
CTIP to deliver and return the 600 hogsheads of Virginia leaf tobacco involved
in the case to the custody of the Bureau of Customs under the control and
supervision of the Commissioner of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition further prays that pending decision an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> writ of preliminary injunction be issued res­training
the respondent Judge from enforcing his order of June 9, 1965, and the
respondent CTIP from disposing of and/or interfering in any manner with
petitioner's tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged in
the petition that the Col­lector of Customs, without authority, had illegally
released the tobacco in question to the <span class="GramE">CTIP, that</span> the
latter had no right to the tobacco, and the respondent Judge, also without
authority, had validated the release of the tobacco to the CTIP.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. On July 12, 1965, this Court, upon the filing of a bond of
P5,000.00 by <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>,
issued a writ of preliminary injunction addressed to Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Clo­ribel</span>, to CTIP, to the Consolidated Terminals,
Inc., to the Collector of Customs, and to the Commissioner of Customs,
enjoining them "from enforcing the order of June 9, 1965 and from
disposing of and/or interfering in any manner with herein petitioner's tobacco
in Civil Case No. 59344 (<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>,
et al. v. Consolidated Terminals, Inc., et al) of the Court of First Instance
of Manila, Branch VI)."</p>

<p class="NUM">3. On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1965</st1:date>,
the CTIP filed a petition to lift the above-mentioned writ of preliminary in­junction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this motion of CTIP <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed his opposition on <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1965</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to take note of that motion of CTIP.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. On <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1965</st1:date>,
the CTIP filed a peti­tion, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="12">December

and instead proposed that the 600 hogsheads of <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
leaf tobacco in question be released to him upon his filing a bond in the sum
of P2<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>, or such amount as this Court would
determine, to answer for customs duties, taxes and other legal expenses.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. On <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1966</st1:date>,
this Court required the Col­lector of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs
to comment on the petition, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1965</st1:date>, of CTIP to lift the preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1966</st1:date>,
Collector of Customs Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> submitted his
comment on the petition of CTIP, concluding his comment with a recommendation
that the petition for the lifting of the writ of preliminary injunction be
granted "since such action will as well re­dound to the advantage and
benefit of the Government."</p>

<p class="NUM">7. On <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1966</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a mani­festation
by way of an answer to the comment of Col­lector of Customs Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, reiterating his object­ion to the lifting of the
writ of preliminary injunc­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
same time <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
brought to the at­tention of this Court that on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1966</st1:date> the case, G. R. No. L-25181, entitled
"<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> v. The
Court of Tax Appeals, et al." was submitted for decision, stating that the
issues raised in that case have a direct bearing on the matter regarding the
disposition of the tobacco in question.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. On <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1966</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General, in behalf of the Commissioner of Customs, filed his com­ment
to the petition of the CTIP of <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1965</st1:date> praying for the lifting of the writ of preliminary in­junction,
in compliance with the order of this Court of March 7, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his comment the Solicitor General embodied
a letter addressed to him by Commissioner of Customs Jacinto T. <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> wherein the latter stated that he concurred with the
stand taken by Collector of Customs <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General submitted the matter
regarding the petition of the CTIP to lift the writ of preliminary injunction
to the sound discretion of this Court in the light of the facts stated in his
comment.</p>

<p class="NUM">9. On <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
filed a petition, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1966</st1:date>,
to defer act­ion on the petition of CTIP to lift the preliminary injunction
until the decision of this case on the merits, along with the decision in the
companion case of "<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
v. <span class="GramE">The Court of Tax Appeals, et al.," G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-25181, considering that both cases had already been submitted to
this Court for decision.</span></p>

<p class="NUM">10. On May 9, 1966, the CTIP filed an "Urgent Manifestation
and Reiteration of Motion for Lifting of Preliminary Injunction", dated
May 6, 1966, and pray­ing for an early decision of this case.</p>

<p class="NUM">11. On May 9, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a manifesta­tion on the comment submitted by the
Solicitor General dated April 13, 1966 and, among others, called the at­tention
of this Court to the fact that Secretary of Fi­nance Eduardo G. <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> had reversed and counter­manded the concurrence
of Commissioner of Customs <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> to the stand taken
by Collector of Customs <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> regard­ing the release
of the tobacco in question.</p>

<p class="NUM">12. On <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
filed a "Reiteration of Opposition to the Lifting of the Writ of
Preliminary Injunction."</p>

<p class="NUM">13. On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1966</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a pe­tition,
dated <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1966</st1:date>,
praying for the release of the tobacco in question to him upon his filing of a
bond in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>, or such other
amount as this Court would determine to answer for customs duties and taxes and
other legal charges.</p>

<p class="NUM">14. On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1966</st1:date>,
the Luzon Stevedoring Corporation filed a motion, praying that it be authorized
to proceed to satisfy its lien on the 600 hogsheads of <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
leaf tobacco which are deposited in its ware­houses, pursuant to Section 33 of
the Warehouse Receipts Law, on account of the warehousing and other charges on
said tobacco.</p>

<p class="NUM">15. On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
filed his opposition to the afore-mentioned motion of the Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation.</p>

<p class="NUM">16. On <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1966</st1:date>,
the CTIP filed an "Ur­gent Supplemental Petition to Lift the Preliminary
In­junction" dated <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="12">December 27,
 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">17. On December 28, 1966, the Collector of Customs, thru Special
Counsel Jose <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>, filed an urgent motion, dated
December 20, 1966, praying for an early decision of this case and for the
lifting of the writ of prelimi­nary injunction upon the posting of a bond by
the CTIP in the amount of P20,000.00.</p>

<p class="NUM">18. On <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1966</st1:date>,
the CTIP filed a manifestation stating that "the Solicitor General, as
coun­sel for the Commissioner of Customs, is agreeable to <span class="SpellE">CTIP's</span>
'Urgent Supplemental Petition to Lift Prelimi­nary Injunction' dated <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1966</st1:date>, as shown by the
letter of the Solicitor General which is annexed to the manifestation."</p>

<p class="NUM">19. On January 23, 1967, the CTIP filed "Addi­tional Grounds
for Lifting of Injunction", dated Jan­uary 18, 1967, as a supplement to
its "Urgent Supplementary Petition to Lift Preliminary Injunction" of
December 27, 1966, calling attention to the fact that the bond which was filed
by the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
for the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction in the sum of P5,000.00
is inadequate, and that the bond was filed by the Citadel Insurance Co., which
is one of the bonding companies that are black-listed by the In­surance
Commissioner on September 30, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
CTIP also calls attention to the fact that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hian</span> is facing two charges before the Deportation
Board for tax evasion and fraud, and that if he is deported by reason of said
cases he would not be able to answer for the damages suffered and accruing to
the CTIP.</p>

<p class="NUM">20. Again, on January 25, 1967, the CTIP, thru another counsel,
filed an "Urgent Manifestation", also calling attention to the fact
that the P5,000,00 bond filed by <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction
is inadequate and that said bond was posted by the Citadel Insurance Company,
Inc., which is a black-listed insurance company whose opera­tion as a bonding
company was suspended by the Insur­ance Commissioner on September 30, 1966, and
that <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> is facing
charges before the Deportation Board for tax evasion and in the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of Manila for illegal importation of
American Virginia leaf to­bacco, in violation of the provisions of Republic Act
1194, as amended by Republic Act 4155.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this mani­festation, the CTIP proposes that the writ of preli­minary
injunction be lifted upon its filing of a <span class="SpellE">coun­terbond</span>
of P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>, but that if this proposal is not
accepted by the Court, <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
be required to increase his bond for the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction to P1,000,000.00.</p>

<p class="NUM">21. To the foregoing "Urgent Manifestation" filed by the
CTIP, <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a
reply on <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1967</st1:date>,
stating that the Citadel Insurance Company, Inc. has been authorized by the
Insurance Commissioner to transact business effective <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1967</st1:date>, as shown in the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">photostatic</span></span> copy of the
certification of said Insurance Commissioner attached to the reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reply also states that the filing of
charges against <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
before the Deportation Board is immaterial to the issues involved in the present
case, because the basis of the charges of alleged non-payment of taxes are
still the subject of proceedings before this Court in two cases (G. R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-23395 and L-26790).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this reply <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
prays that the tobacco in question be re­leased to him upon the filing of a
surety bond in the amount which this Court would determine, to answer for
customs duties, taxes and other legal charges.</p>

<p class="NUM">22. On <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court, resolving the motion of CTIP for the lifting of the writ of
injunction, required <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
to increase the injunction bond, within fifteen days after notice, to P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">23. On <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a peti­tion
for reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1967</st1:date> increasing the injunction bond to P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>,
and re­iterating his opposition to the lifting of the writ of preliminary
injunction.</p>

<p class="NUM">24. On February 14, 1967, the respondent CTIP filed its opposition
to the motion for reconsideration of the order increasing the injunction bond
to P1,000,000.00, and praying further that upon failure of <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hian</span> to file the bond the writ of preliminary
injunction be dis­missed.</p>

<p class="NUM">25. On <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court issued a resolution denying the motion for reconsideration of the
order of <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1967</st1:date>
and deferring action on the matter regarding the lifting of the injunction.</p>

<p class="NUM">26. On February 23, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a peti­tion to reduce the bond from
P1,000,000.00 to P50,000.00, and that he be given at least thirty days from the
date of receipt of the resolution of the Court within which to file the reduced
injunction bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion of peti­tioner
was opposed by respondent CTIP in an opposition filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">27. On March 17, 1967, this Court issued an order denying the
petition of <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> for
the reduction of the injunction bond from P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>
to P50,000.00 and ordering said petitioner to file the injunction bond of
P1,000,000.00 within thirty days from receipt of the copy of the resolution,
and in the meantime denying the petition of CTIP for the lifting of the
preliminary in­junction.</p>

<p class="NUM">28. On <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1967</st1:date>,
Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>, special counsel for the Collector
of Customs, filed a manifesta­tion reiterating the prayer for the immediate
lifting of the preliminary injunction upon the ground that the tobacco involved
in this case is fast deteriorating.</p>

<p class="NUM">29. On April 5, 1967, counsel for CTIP filed a petition, dated
April 3, 1967, praying for the dismis­sal of the instant case upon the ground
that the pro­ceedings in the instant case have become academic, be­cause the
respondent Judge had already ordered the dis­missal of Civil Case No. 59344 of
the Court of First In­stance of Manila and had declared his order of June 9,
1965 in said case to be of no further legal effect; and the writ of mandamus
prayed for by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
in the instant case is precisely to compel the respond­ent Judge to dismiss
that Civil Case No. 59344, and the writ of certiorari prayed for is precisely
to declare null and void respondent Judge's order of June 9, 1965 in said Civil
Case No. 59344.</p>

<p class="NUM">30. On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court issued an order requiring <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> to comment within ten days from notice thereof on the
petition for dismissal filed by counsel for CTIP.</p>

<p class="NUM">31. On April 21, 1967, counsel for CTIP filed a motion reiterating
its petition for dismissal dated April 3, 1967, and pointing further that <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> failed to file the
injunction bond of P1,000,000.00 with­in the time he was required to do so by
this Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">32. On <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed a motion
for extension of thirty days from <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="3">March
 20, 1967</st1:date> within which to file the P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>
injunction bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was opposed
by counsel for CTIP.</p>

<p class="NUM">33. On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court granted <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
an extension of fifteen days from <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="4">April
 19, 1967</st1:date> to file the injunction bond of P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">34. On <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> again moved for
a further extension of thirty days within which to file the injunction bond of
P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was opposed by counsel for the CTIP.</p>

<p class="NUM">35. On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1967</st1:date>,
counsel for CTIP filed an urgent reiteration of the motion for dismissal dated <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">36. On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court issued an order deferring action on the motion for dismissal until
af­ter receipt of the comment on said motion from the <span class="SpellE">adversed</span>
party, and granting <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>
the last exten­sion of thirty days from May 4 within which to file the P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> injunction bond.</p>

<p class="NUM">37. On June 2, 1967, <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed his comment on the motion to dismiss this case,
manifesting his op­position to said motion to dismiss upon the ground that the
dismissal of this case would have the effect of dis­solving the writ of
preliminary injunction issued by this Court on July 12, 1965, said writ of
preliminary injunction having been issued precisely to prevent the disposal of
the tobacco involved in this case by the CTIP, the delivery of which by the
Collector of Customs to the CTIP was validated by the questioned order of June
9, 1965; and stating further that the dissolution of the preliminary injunction
would enable the CTIP, which is not legally entitled to that tobacco, to dis­pose
of that tobacco, and that whatever decision would be rendered in CTA Case No.
1560 pending in the Court of Tax Appeals, which also involves the same tobacco,
would be nugatory and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>, instead, prayed that
the tobacco in question be released to him upon his filing a surety bond in an
amount to be fixed by this Court, in addition to the P1<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>
injunction bond that he is required to file.</p>

<p class="NUM">38. On June 3, 1967, Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>,
special counsel for the Collector of Customs, filed a manifesta­tion calling
attention to the fact that the tobacco in­volved in this case is fast deteriorating
and that the Government would suffer damages as a result of said de­terioration,
and thereby prayed that this case be dis­missed, or that an order be issued
lifting the writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="NUM">39. On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1967</st1:date>,
this Court issued an order setting this case for hearing on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="6">Tuesday, June 20, 1967</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 a.m.</st1:time> on all pending matters incident to
the case.</p>

<p class="NUM">40. At the hearing held on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1967</st1:date>, all the parties in this case were represented by
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coun­sel for <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> argued the case for
the petitioner, and Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> argued the case for the respondents, and after the
hearing all the pending in­cidents in this case were considered submitted for
resolution.</p>

<p class="NUM">41. After the pending incidents in this case were heard <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> filed, on June 27,
1967, an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> urgent manifestation
by way of a supplement to the ar­guments and/or remarks made by his counsel
during the hearing, and further assuring the Court that he could raise a P3<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> bond for the release of the to­bacco in question
in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the main petition in this case, the
above-mentioned petitions, motions and mani­festations, as well as the answers,
oppositions, com­ments and replies filed thereto, and the memoranda filed by
the parties, and also the arguments adduced at the hearing on June 20, 1967, it
appearing that the dismis­sal by the respondent Judge of Civil Case No. 59344
in the Court of First Instance of Manila and his having declared without legal
force and effect the order of June 9, 1965 issued in said case were practically
the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hian</span> in his prayer for a writ of mandamus and
certiorari in this case, such that the issues involved in the petition for cer­tiorari
and mandamus with preliminary injunction in this case have practically become
academic; and it ap­pearing, further, that the 600 hogsheads of Virginia leaf
tobacco involved in the present case is the same 600 hogsheads of tobacco which
are involved in G. R. No. L-25181, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hian</span> v. The Court of Tax Ap­peals," which was
decided by this Court on January 11, 1967, and in that case We held that the
Court of Tax Ap­peals has the jurisdiction to hear and determine all mat­ters
relating to the sale or the disposition of said 600 hogsheads of tobacco in CTA
Case No. 1560 which this Court remanded to said Court of Tax Appeals for
further proceedings and decision, the Court RESOLVED:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) to grant the motion of CTIP, dated April
3, 1967, to dis­miss this case, as it is hereby dismissed without costs; and,
in consequence thereof, for the reason that the question of preliminary
injunction is, at this time, properly cognizable by the Court of Tax Appeals,
to con­sider the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court on July
12, 1965 dissolved and without any fur­ther force and effect upon this
resolution becoming final; (2) to deny the prayers contained in all the other
petitions, motions, and manifestations, enumerated in this resolution, which
have not yet been resolved by this Court, without prejudice to the party or
parties concerned filing his/its/their motions/petitions/mani­festations before
the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA Case No. 1560 now pending in said court; and
(3) to furnish the Court of Tax Appeals a copy of this resolution.</p>
