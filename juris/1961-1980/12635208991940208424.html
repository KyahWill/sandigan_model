				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">G.R. No. L-28389 is a petition for review of the injunction-order
issued by the Court of In­dustrial Relations on 25 July 1967 (in its Case No.
219-Inj.), affirmed by resolution of the court <u>en banc</u> of 4 December
1967; while G.R. No. L-29079 is an original petition filed in this Court to
prohibit the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila from
taking cognizance of Civil Case No. 71186 of said court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties in both instances being
practically the same, and the issues involved therein having arisen from the
same set of facts, We are taking up the two cases together.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the records that on account of the strike staged
by some of its employees on 10 July 1967, <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> San
Bazaar, located in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City and owned and operated
by Andres Lao, Sr., petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations on 18 July
1967 (Case No. 219-Inj) for a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the
respondents <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> San Em­ployees' Union (hereinafter
referred to as the Union), to which the striking employees were affiliated, and
the Federation of Hotels, Restaurants and General Workers Union of the
Philippines<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
(hereinafter referred to as the Federation), from picketing the establishment
and premises of petitioner; from preventing, by means of coercion, violence,
force and intimidation, the entering into the establishment of employees who
were willing to go to work, and from unlawfully impeding, obstructing or
hampering the ingress and egress of its customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, likewise, prayed that respondents
be ordered to pay damages; that after hearing the injunction be made permanent,
the strike be declared illegal, and peti­tioner be authorized to dismiss the
employees or workers who participated in the said illegal strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> hearing,
during which the petitioner's evidence was received, the hearing judge issued
an order, dated 25 July 1967, enjoining the respondents, among other things,
from obstructing or blocking the free and customary ingress and egress of
customers in peti­tioner's store; from disrupting the business operations of
petitioner by means of stationary human blockade at the entrances to the
establishment; and from instilling fear to the non-striking workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="7">26 July 1967</st1:date>,
the respondent Unions moved for the dismissal of the petition for lack of
jurisdiction, contending that as the petition did not mention any unfair labor
practice, then the action is a simple case of injunction properly cognizable by
the regular courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day,
said Unions also filed with the court <u>en banc</u> a motion for
reconsideration of the injunction-order, on the ground that the requisites for
the issuance thereof <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>, as provided in
Section 9, paragraph (d) of Republic Act 875, were not complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pointed out that the fact that the
police officers made arrests of the picketers indicated that the police
authorities were not unable nor unwilling to provide adequate protection to
petitioner as to entitle the latter to a writ of preliminary injunction without
respondents' evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also show that under date of <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="7">29 July 1967</st1:date> (four days after issuance of the
preliminary injunction), <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> San Bazaar and/or
Andres Lao, Sr., filed charges of unfair labor practices against the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,
the Federation, and 14 individuals.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was there alleged that on 27 April 1967, complainant received a letter from
the respondents demanding the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> in its employ; that when said demand was
refused because <span class="SpellE">Mortera's</span> contract of employment had
terminated on 31 January 1967, and she had already found employment in another
firm as of February, 1967, the respondent workers staged a strike on 10 July
1967 without previous notice; that the strike and picketing in the
establishment were causing losses to said complainant at the rate of P6,000,00
a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="8">3 August 1967</st1:date>, the formal complaint for unfair labor
practice based on the aforementioned charges was filed by the Acting Assistant
Chief Prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations (Case No. 4766-ULP).</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents moved for the dismissal of this case for lack of
cause of action, claiming that the complainants' charges of 29 July 1967, as
well as the complaint of 3 August 1967, were apparently "after
thoughts" filed to bestow jurisdiction on the court, after the want of
such jurisdic­tion became manifest in Case No. 219-Inj.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 September 1967, the hearing judge issued in this Case No.
4799-ULP a writ of preliminary injunction, restraining respondents Union and
Federation, their agents and representatives, from unlawfully obstructing,
blocking and preventing the free and customary ingress and egress of
complainant's employees desiring to work, and the customers wanting to do
business with them; from coercing and threatening the non-striking employees
and from maintaining a picket so close to the premises as to prevent the
passage of employees, customers and the transit of goods.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it appears that as early as 18 April 1967 a
complaint for unfair labor practice was already filed against <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> San Bazaar, Andres Lao, Sr., Rosario Lao, and Cesar
Mendoza (Case No. 4736-ULP) for the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> allegedly on account of union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on 7 August 1967, another complaint for
unfair labor practice (Case No. 4803-ULP) was filed in the Court of Industrial
Relations against Andres Lao, Sr., in connection with the dismissal of union
members <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Genove</span>, on
9 May 1967; Josefina <span class="SpellE">Dalibuso</span>, on 14 June 1967;
Patricia <span class="SpellE">Balanag</span>, on 15 May 1967; Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Mallek</span>, on 17 May 1967; and Lydia Calderon, on 30 May 1967,
allegedly for union activities.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a single decision rendered on 16 September 1967 in Cases Nos.
4736-ULP, 4799-ULP and 4803-ULP, which were consolidated, the court made the
findings that the separation of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> from Lao's employ on 31 January 1967 was due to the
expiration of her contract of employment and not because of union activities,
as claimed in Case No. 4736-ULP; that the dismissals of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Genove</span>, Patricia <span class="SpellE">Balanag</span>,
Josefina <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span>, Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Mallek</span>
and Lydia Calderon were all for cause, ranging from dishonesty, inefficiency,
to discourtesy, and not by reason of union membership, as charged in Case No.
4803-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, therefore, ruled
that since none of the reasons given in the Federa­tion's notice of strike,
dated <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="5">15 May 1967</st1:date>, had been
substantiated, then the strike was for trivial causes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, taking into consideration the evidence
introduced by the employer in Case No. 4799-ULP, to the effect that the
strikers and their sympathizers, in carrying out the strike, not only picketed
the premises of the establishment by standing immobile at the entrances to the
store, thereby preventing the free ingress and egress of customers, but even
verbally threatened with harm non-strikers and customers alike, the court
concluded that the picketing was conducted in an illegal manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Cases Nos. 4736-ULP and 4803-ULP
were dismissed; the Union, as a direct affiliate of the Federation, was
declared to have committed an illegal strike which commenced on 10 July 1967;
and respondents <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanon</span>,
Fe <span class="SpellE">Deioferio</span>, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>,
Catalina Flores, <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Gurion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Charito</span> <span class="SpellE">Milana</span>, Leticia <span class="SpellE">Dumpit</span>, and Mila <span class="SpellE">Bacuites</span> were
declared to have lost their status as employees of Andres Lao, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in Case No. 219-Inj., the Industrial Court <u>en banc</u>,
by resolution of 4 December 1967,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
denied the respondents' motion for reconsideration of the 25 July injunction-order,
with two judges con­curring on the ground that it has become moot and academic,
and one judge not taking part therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this resolution, the respondents took an appeal to this Court,
which was docketed as G.R. No. C-28389.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 November 1967, Andres Lao, Sr., commenced in the Court of
First Instance of Manila Civil Case No. 71186, for damages, for alleged losses
that he sustained on account of the strike and picket conducted by the
defendants, which were declared illegal by final de­cision of the Court of
Industrial Relations in consolidated Cases Nos. 4736-ULP, 4799-ULP, and
4803-ULP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, whose given postal
and business address was 313 Vermont, <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, Manila,
demanded from the defendants<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
payment of the aforesaid actual damages for loss of gross income from 10 July
to 10 October 1967, at the rate of from P5,000.00 to P6,000.00 a day; for loss
of income at the rate of P1,000.00 a day, from 10 July to 10 October 1967; the
sum of P200,000.00, as moral damages; P50,000.00, as nominal and exemplary
damages; P5,000.00, for transportation and court expenses; P10,000.00, as
attorneys' fees; and for costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the complaint, defendants filed a motion to dismiss,
alleging improper venue, lack of cause of action, absence of jurisdiction by
the court, and <span class="SpellE">untimeliness</span> of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was defendants' claim that in the various
cases brought to the Court of Industrial Relations, plaintiff's postal and
business address had always been Nos. 48-50 <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City; that pursuant to Section 15 of Republic
Act 875, the violation by a labor organization of its duty to bargain
collectively, which includes going on strike without first bargaining
collectively with the employer, shall cause only the denial to the striking
union members of their rights and privileges under the Act; that mere
membership in a labor union is not suf­ficient reason to hold one liable for
the acts of individuals carried out for the union; that there still remained
unresolved by the Court of Industrial Relations a motion connected with the
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the de­fendants referred to the appeal taken to this Court from
the resolution of the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
<u>en banc</u> in CIR Case No. 219-Inj.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(G.R. No. L-28389) as additional support to their allegation that the
action for damages was premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 1 April 1968, the motion to dismiss was denied, the court
holding that plaintiff's present residence being at 616 Vermont, <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, the filing of the action in the Manila Court of
First Instance was proper; that the allegations of the complaint were
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, because the 16 September 1967
decision in CIR Case No. 4799-ULP, upon which the action was based, was already
final; and that the objection against the timeliness of the action, being evidentiary,
can only be determined after hearing on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration of this order
having been denied, the defendants filed in this Court the present prohibition
proceeding, which was docketed as G.R. No. L-29079.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in case G.R. No. L-28389 actually is very simple, i.e.,
whether or not the hearing judge was correct in issuing an <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> writ of preliminary injunction on 25 July 1967,
to restrain the picketing of <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> San Bazaar by
herein petitioners, and the court <u>en banc</u>, in affirming said injunction
in its resolution of 4 December 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">It needs no emphasis that an <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
writ of preliminary injunction such as the one issued by the hearing judge on <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="7">25 July 1967</st1:date>, which was the subject
of herein petitioners' motion for reconsideration in the court <u>en banc</u>,
lost its efficacy five days thereafter.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This fact was admitted by petitioners themselves in their motion of <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="8">5 August 1967</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In short, even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that, as
charged by the petitioners, the requisites for issuance thereof were not
present when the preliminary injunction of 25 July 1967 was ordered, the
question of the validity or invalidity of such order had become moot and
academic upon expiration of the prescribed five-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>en banc</u>, therefore, could
not really have done more than what it did - to deny review or reconsideration
of the disputed order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that
an appeal now either from that resolution of the court <u>en banc</u> or from
the hearing judge's order of <st1:date year="1967" day="25" month="7">25 July
 1967</st1:date> would also be moot and academic, and serve no legitimate
purpose at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. L-29079, on the other hand, the objections of peti­tioners
to the exercise by the Manila Court of First Instance of jurisdiction over the
action for damages stem from the argument that the demand should have been made
in the unfair labor practice case in the Court of Industrial Relations where
the alleged illegality of the strike was declared; that the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the appeal from the 25 July 1967 order of injunction (G.R. No. L-28389)
indicates that petitioners are holding on to their employee status, thus making
the case fall beyond the competence of courts of general jurisdiction; and that
the heavy expenditures and troubles to petitioners that the trial in Manila
will entail can be avoided because the Industrial Court can hold hearings
anywhere in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present petition is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action filed in the court below is a
simple case for recovery of damages arising from certain illegal acts allegedly
committed by therein defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
nothing to do at all with the relationship between an employer and his
employees, nor with any labor dispute pending in the Court of Industrial
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that
the decision in consolidated Cases Nos. 4736- ULP, 4799-ULP and 4803-ULP had
already become final, and there is no showing that said cases were not thus
closed and terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither would the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of herein petitioners' motion for
reconsideration in Case 219-Inj., and the subsequent filing of the appeal to
this Court from the re­solution denying the same, provide support to the
contention that jurisdiction over the demand for damages belongs to the Court
of Industrial Relations, or that the said action is premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue raised in that motion for
reconsideration, besides having become moot and academic after 30 July 1967,
has nothing to do at all with the alleged commission by defendants (herein
petitioners) of illegal acts until 10 October 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisprudential rule prevailing at the time was that the
Court of Industrial Relations could not validly make in an unfair labor
practice case an award for damages sustained by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the issue would then be one purely civil
in nature, a pure money matter, which is cognizable by the Court of First
Instance, as ruled by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span> vs. Ortiz,
108 Phil. 538, 541 (citing Allied Free Workers' Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>,
102 Phil. 292).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>, Inc. vs. Erlanger &amp; <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>
Employees Association, 104 Phil. 17,21, it was said:</p>

<blockquote>"While there is merit in petitioner's claim that the lower
court should not have dismissed its entire petition on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction, because said petition also asks for payment of the damages
suffered by the company on account of the alleged acts of violence and coercion
committed by the respondent union in the course of its picket­ing of
petitioner's premises, whether or not such damages are recoverable, and to what
extent, would still have to depend on the evidence in the unfair labor practice
case between the parties pending in the Court of Industrial Relations, and its
final outcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the dismissal of the
present action by the lower court was made without prejudice, such dismissal
does not cause petitioner any substan­tial injury or damage, as it may
institute another action for damages against the respondent union if its right
to do so is held to exist by the Industrial Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the filing of the damages case would cause incon­veniences
to therein defendants would not justify the dismissal of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is not one of the
grounds provided for the purpose under the Rules, and, secondly, such
inconveniences on the part of the defendants can not defeat the right
specifically granted by the Rules<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> to
the plaintiff, to select the proper venue for his action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 11pt;">FOR
THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</span></b><span style="font-size: 11pt;">, the appeal from the order of 25 July 1967 and
