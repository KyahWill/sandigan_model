accused Jose Vicente, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., appealed to this Court on the sole issue of
credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts are not in dispute:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the night of 29 October 1965, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
was attacked and stabbed in front of the public market in <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, as a conse­quence of which he died that
same evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The autopsy report of the
Municipal Health Officer disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
sustained:</p>

<p class="BODY">One crescent-shaped flap wound involving the entire thickness of
the scalp over the right anterior parietal area, 7 cm. from edge to edge;</p>

<p class="BODY">One 2.5 cm. stab wound over the left cheek exposing the cheek
bone;</p>

<p class="BODY">Five stab wounds in the chest and stomach (frontal), all 3 cm.
wide, entering <span class="SpellE">antero-posteriorly</span> toward the right,
two of them cutting the big vessels of the heart and injuring the lungs;</p>

<p class="BODY">One stab wound, 2 cm. wide, penetrating into the right thoracic
cage; </p>

<p class="BODY">One 2 cm. wide stab wound, mid-section of left arm;</p>

<p class="BODY">One clean-cut wound, 5 cm. long, between the thumb and the index
finger of right hand almost severing thumb down to the base;</p>

<p class="BODY">At the back, the deceased received:</p>

<p class="BODY">One lacerated wound over the occipital area, 3.5 cm. long,
involving the entire thickness of the scalp;</p>

<p class="BODY">One stab wound at the posterior base of neck, 2.5 cm. long, 6 cm.
deep, vertical in position;</p>

<p class="BODY">One stab wound, 1.5 cm. long, 1 cm. deep, located over the right <span class="SpellE">para</span>-vertebral level of the third thoracic vertebra;</p>

<p class="BODY">One 5 cm. scratch wound, 6 cm. below the left scapula, starting
as a superficial gaping wound and ending as epidermal wound;</p>

<p class="BODY">One stab wound over <span class="SpellE">postero</span>-lateral
portion of the distal third of left arm, 3 cm. long, 5.5 cm. deep, penetrating
medially and passing posterior to the <span class="SpellE">humerus</span>; and</p>

<p class="BODY">One clean-cut wound forming 4 cm. skin flap, located 2 cm. above
elbow joint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stab wounds were found to have been inflicted by two kinds of
sharp-edged instruments; the crescent-shaped wound, by a broken bottle; and the
occipital wound could have been caused by a blunt instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time of death was placed between 7 and <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> p. m. of <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="10">29 October 1965</st1:date>; the cause of death - shock due to severe

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="10">30 October 1965</st1:date>,
a criminal complaint for murder was filed in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, against Jose
Vicente, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
corresponding information, filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No.
22747-I) on 18 April 1966,charged the above-named persons of having conspired
in attacking and assaulting, treacherously, Jaime Mariano <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
inflicting upon him multiple wounds and injuries that caused his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution, composed primarily-of the
testimony of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
tends to establish that in the evening of 29 October 1965 Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Arellano, and
witness <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> were in the store of one <span class="SpellE">Arsing</span> Fernandez in the public market of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, buying
cigarettes; that while they were counting the change of their money accused
Jose Vicente came, placed his hands on the shoulder of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, and asked the latter in <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>,
"Why are you always with Boy <span class="SpellE">Cañaveral</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that you were his companion
when he shot <span class="SpellE">Manong</span> <span class="SpellE">Idio</span>".<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
To this remark <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> answered, also in the <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> dialect, "of course not".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no sooner had he made this denial than
Jose Vicente pulled a dagger from his waist and thrust it several times on the
body of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, who fell to the ground face
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>, a companion of Jose Vicente, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> with a small knife, hitting the latter a number of
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente's other companions,
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> and some­body who was later
identified as <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>,
Jr., picked up stones and stoned the prostrate man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, apparently noticing <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span>
com­panions (<span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> and Arellano who were
witnessing the incident, they also threw stones at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two had to move away to a distance of
about 6 meters, and later on fled from the scene.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of the accused is <u>alibi</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that all of them were at some place other
than the scene of the crime when the stabbing incident happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>,
Jr., testified at the trial that at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="10">29 October 1965</st1:date>
he was in the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> station in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, trying to
get a ride back to <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> after an unfruitful trip
to <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, in
search of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that the last
bus for <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> had already left, he was about to
leave the station when Jose Vicente, Er­nesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>,
and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> arrived; that they decided to
hike all the way to <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that when they reached
barrio <span class="SpellE">Dumampot</span> they were met by <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>
policemen who brought them to the municipal building and placed them in jail
for the killing of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>; that on 1 November
1965 the police made him sign certain papers, telling him that he would be
allowed to go home thereafter; that he did not read, nor was he informed of,
the contents of the papers that he signed, which turned out to be a statement
narrating his alleged participation in the killing of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> declared that from 6
o'clock until 7:30 in the evening of 29 October 1965 he was at the MGM canteen
in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, drinking
beer with Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>; that Jose Vicente was
with them at the start, but he left to get some clothes in barrio <span class="SpellE">Camantiles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, and returned only after 7:30 in the evening;
that after Jose Vicente drank one bottle of beer they all left the canteen and
went to the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> station to get a ride for <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that there they met <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., who informed them that the last bus for
<span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> had already left; that they decided to hike
up to their town; that when they reached barrio <span class="SpellE">Dumampot</span>
they were met and arrested by <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> policemen who
brought them to the municipal building and placed them in jail; that the police
did not ask him to sign any written statement, probably because, when he was
investigated, he denied participation in the slaying of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span> testified that in the
morning of 29 October 1965, upon invitation of Jose Vicente, he and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> went with him (Jose) to barrio <span class="SpellE">Camantiles</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to go
fishing; that they stayed in <span class="SpellE">Camantiles</span> until 5:30 in
the afternoon, when they left for the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
(<span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>); that they went to the MGM canteen in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> to drink beer; that at about 7:30 in the evening
they left the canteen and pro­ceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
station to get a ride home to <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, but they met <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., who told
them that the last bus for <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> had left; that
they agreed to walk all the way to <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that at
about 10:00 o'clock, when they were in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dumampot</span>,
they were arrested by the <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> police, brought to
the municipal building and jailed, allegedly for having killed Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>; that on the night of 1 November 1965, at about
9:00 o'clock, he was taken out of jail and brought to the plaza where he was
maltreated; then they returned him to the municipal building where he was made
to sign certain papers; that afraid of being subjected to further maltreat­ment
he signed the papers (Exhibit C)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
without knowing their contents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose Vicente, on the witness stand, declared that in the morning
of 29 October 1965 he went to barrio <span class="SpellE">Camantiles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to visit
his wife and child who were staying with her (the wife's) relatives; that he
was accompanied in this trip by Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> and
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escor­pizo</span> whom he invited to go with him;
that they stayed in <span class="SpellE">Camantiles</span> until 5:30 in the
afternoon when they left for <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>; that in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> they went to the MGM canteen and drank beer; that
remembering having left his clothes in <span class="SpellE">Camantiles</span> he
returned for them, arriving in the barrio at 6:30 in the afternoon; that after
getting the clothing he immediately left for the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
and joined his companions; that after drinking one more bottle of beer the
three of them proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> station to
get a ride for <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that they were informed by <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., whom they
met at the station, that there was no more available trip for <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that they decided to hike the distance to <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, when
they reached barrio <span class="SpellE">Dumampot</span>, they were stopped by <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> policemen who brought them to the municipal
building and jailed them for the killing of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>;
that on 10 December 1965, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening, he was brought
out of the jail, where he found policeman Juan <span class="SpellE">Cañaveral</span>;
that with his carbine pointed at him (the accused) <span class="SpellE">Cañaveral</span>
directed him to go up the municipal building; that there he was required to
sign a piece of paper; that when he protested and expressed the desire to
consult first his lawyer before signing it <span class="SpellE">Cañaveral</span>
retorted that there was no need for his lawyer; that when Canaveral cocked his
Carbine, and believing that the policeman would make good his threat, he signed
the papers (Exhibit A),<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the contents of which he did not know.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="6">8 June
 1966</st1:date>, the court found the four accused guilty of murder as charged,
the stabbing of the deceased Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> having
been characterized by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in
view of the absence of any miti­gating or aggravating circumstance attending
the crime, all accused were accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of life
imprisonment; jointly and severally, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in
the sum of P6,000.00; and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In interposing the present appeal, it is claimed for the accused-appellants
that the lower court erred in giving credence to the testimony of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>; in giving
weight to the extra-judicial confessions of Jose Vicente, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., and in imposing upon them the penalty <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the issue presented here is on credibility of
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the rule on this point,
settled and well established to create any doubt, is that the factual
conclusion reached by the trial judge, who was afforded the opportunity to
observe the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses while tes­tifying, is not to
be disturbed unless there is proof of <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span>
of the evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, we find no reason to disagree with the ruling of
the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The identification of
the accused as the persons who took part in the assault of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was established by the direct and positive
declaration of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>. The records show that in the evening of 29
October 1965, immediately after the incident, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
executed a statement before the police naming Jose Vicente, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> and
another person, whose name he did not know then but whom he could recognize (as
in fact he did during the trial), as the assailants of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have been because of this statement
that about 2 hours thereafter the police authorities of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>
were able to arrest the four accused walking together in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dumampot</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
elementary that against the positive identification by an eyewitness of the
accused as perpetrators of the crime their defense of <u>alibi</u>, recognized
to be the weakest of defenses, cannot prevail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the testimony of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
on the cir­cumstances surrounding the incident deserves credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only does it appear clear,
straightforward and convincing, but it is also corroborated on its material
portions by other evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, his
declaration that the deceased, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, was
conversing with accused Jose Vicente when the latter pulled a bladed weapon from
his waist and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> with it many times is
supported by the number and position of the fatal stab wounds sustained by the
deceased in the chest and stomach judging from the direction of the wounds and
their seriousness, they must have been inflicted by a right-handed person
located in front of the victim, by means of a sharp bladed instrument of 3 cm.
width,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
while the victim was in a standing position.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento's</span> testimony that when <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
fell to the ground, face down, he was stabbed several times by accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span> with a small knife is, likewise, corroborated by
the superficial wounds appearing at the back and arms of the deceased and by
the medical report that the stab wounds were caused by two different kinds of
bladed weapons.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the father of the deceased Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, as well as counsel for the accused, took the
witness stand and testified that during the wake for the deceased, when asked
as to the identity of the assailants, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
denied having knowledge of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
denial, even if actually made, does not detract from the identification he made
before the police and in court; it could have been brought about by a number of
reasons, not unlikely fear of retaliation from relatives or sympathizers of the
offenders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that the
statement naming the four accused was already given when the alleged denial was
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the identification of the
accused by this witness, who knew them personally and who, admittedly, had no
motive on record to testify falsely against them, withstood the extensive cross
examination by defense counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, we find as unworthy of belief the allegation
that the statements executed by Jose Vicente, <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>
(Exhibits A, B, and C) were prepared by the police and signed by them without
knowing their contents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mayor Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, before whom
the statements appear to have been signed, tes­tified on their due execution,
and all accused admitted that they knew of no valid reason<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
why said town official, or the police authorities, would accuse them falsely of
so grave an offense as murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the evidence herein presented, the ruling of the
lower court finding Jose Vicente guilty of the crime of murder as charged must
be sustained. There is ample proof that of the two who stabbed the deceased, it
was this accused who inflicted the first and fatal injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the attack was characterized by
treachery cannot be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim,
who was counting his money when he was approached by Vicente, could not have
anticipated that the latter's queries would be followed immediately by
successive bayonet stabs at his stomach and chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking into account the suddenness of the
attack and the seriousness of the injuries inflicted, it can safely be
concluded that the victim, who was not armed, was never in a position to defend
himself or offer resistance, nor to present risk or danger to the accused, when
he was assaulted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In regard to appellant Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>,
there seems to be no dispute that he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
several times with a small knife only after the latter had fallen to the ground
seriously wounded, if not already dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing that this accused had knowledge of the criminal
intent of Jose Vicente against the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In all likelihood, <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo's</span> act in stabbing
the fallen <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> with a small knife was not in
furtherance of Vicente's aim, which is to kill, but merely to
"show-off" or express his sympathy or feeling of camaraderie with
Vicente.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For such act, which is
certainly unnecessary and not indispensable for the consummation of the
criminal assault on Jaime <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span> should be found guilty only as an accomplice.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is well to recall here the rule established by this Court to the effect that
conspiracy must be shown to exist, by direct or circumstantial evidence, as
clearly and convincingly as the commission of the offense itself, and that
neither joint nor simultaneous action is <u>per se</u> sufficient <span class="SpellE">indicium</span> of conspiracy, unless proved to have been
motivated by a common design,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which, in the case now before us, is not satisfac­torily shown.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the accused Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr.,
witness <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> declared having seen them throw
stones at the deceased after the latter fell to the ground; then, having
noticed him and Arellano, said accused also threw stones at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his signed statement (Exhibit B), <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>, Jr., admitted
having thrown stones only at the person who he allegedly saw coming to him,
probably referring to either <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> or <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Arellano, the companions of the deceased; and in
Exhibits A and C, accused Jose Vicente and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Escorpizo</span>
stated that <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabiles</span>
did not do anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that

when <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was slain and, in fact, <span class="SpellE">Bedonio</span> was arrested with the three other accused, the <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> police did not take his statement, nor was he
