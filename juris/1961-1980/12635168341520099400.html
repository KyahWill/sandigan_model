				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the City Court of Angeles City, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
the City Fiscal prosecuted Donald Cook and <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>
Cook for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, the money involved amounting to P5<span class="GramE">,100.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants filed a motion to quash upon the ground that the Court did not have
jurisdiction over the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hear­ing the parties the Court dismissed the <span class="GramE">case</span>
precisely on that ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the
present appeal by the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved now – whether or not the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> has jurisdiction over the case
– requires construction of the provisions of paragraphs b and c of Section 87
of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended by Republic Act 3823.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the first it is clear that justices of
the peace (municipal judges) and judges of municipal courts of chartered cities
have original and <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction over all cases of larceny,
embezzlement and <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> where the amount of money or
property stolen, em­bezzled, or otherwise involved does not exceed the sum or
value of P200.00. It is similarly obvious that under the second provision,
justices of the peace in the capitals of provinces and <span class="SpellE">subprovinces</span>
and judges of municipal courts have like jurisdiction as the Court of First
Instance to try parties charged with an offense committed within their
respective jurisdiction in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or a fine not exceeding P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>, or both etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
do not see any conflict between the two legal provisions under consideration.
As far as <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases are concerned, if the sum of
money or the value of the property involved does not exceed P200.00, justices
of the peace (municipal judges) and judges of municipal courts of chartered
cities have <u>original and exclusive</u> jurisdiction to try and decide them,
while the same courts would have original but <u>concurrent jurisdiction</u>
with the Court of First Instance of the province over the same cases and
others, provided the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>, or
imprisonment for not more than six years, or a fine not exceeding P6,000, or
both.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before <span class="GramE">Us</span> the penalty
provided for by Article 315, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code is <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its minimum period. Consequently, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> has original but <u>concurrent</u>
<u>juris­diction</u> with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
to try and decide the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the order appealed from is set aside
and this case is remanded below for further proceedings in accordance with law.
