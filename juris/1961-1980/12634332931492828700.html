possess the firearm in his possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He nevertheless invited them to enter his house and partake of some <span class="GramE">beer,</span> and the three -<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Imperial and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> -- then entered the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>

attempted to stand up, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
poked a gun at Imperial and instructed him to get the bolo (Exhibit

<p class="BODY">At the trial of the case of Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
on <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1971</st1:date>, appellant
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
presented Ernesto Imperial and himself as the only witnesses for the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto Imperial testified that
in the morning of <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1967</st1:date>,
he was in his house at <span class="SpellE">Saging</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>,
<span class="GramE">Oriental</span> <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of that date, he went to <span class="SpellE">Pola</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> to ask
policeman Johnny <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> to accompany him to go to <span class="SpellE">Putingtubig</span> for the purpose of collecting some money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he and "Johnny" went to <span class="SpellE">Putingtubig</span>, arriving there at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, but not finding <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> in his house,
they inquired from his wife, <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> Hernandez, of <span class="SpellE">Marcial's</span> whereabouts, and <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span>
informed them that <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> was in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pinamala­yan</span> but
assured them that he would return that afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of that date, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
arrived and upon seeing them, invited them to his house where they were served
beer, although Johnny <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> declined to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of their drinking spree, a
nephew of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span>
arrived, bringing with him "tuba" which <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
mixed with the beer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After consuming the
mixed drink of "tuba" and beer, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
invited them to dinner, but Johnny <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
declined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were eating,
Imperial asked <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span>
to pay his debt, explaining that he needed the money badly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he noticed that <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
was drawing a caliber .22 revolver from his waist (Exhibit "U"), he
(Imperial) immediately grabbed a bolo lying on top of the table (Exhibit
"X") and used it to hack <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>, hitting
the victim on the forehead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> slumped on the table, he hacked him again on the
neck and afterwards got his "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>" from
his pocket and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then divested the victim of his revolver
and afterwards poked the gun at Johnny <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> and got
the latter's caliber .38 pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
while, when <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> Hernandez came down the stairs,
he pulled her and hit her on the forehead with the gun and when she fell, he
stabbed her four or five times with his "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, he approached <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> with the intention of
killing him, but was unable to do so because <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then grabbed Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>
and dragged him up the stairs, where he hogtied him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the store, he got the shoes, transistor
radio and other things, and thereafter set fire to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fled from the scene of the incident with
the intent of looking for <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and when he could not find him, he went to hide in <span class="SpellE">Malaus</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Saging</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>, <span class="GramE">Oriental</span> <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When shown the contents of his sworn
statement (Exhibit "BB") during his cross-examination, which appeared
to be inconsistent with portions of his testimony, Imperial asserted that the
contents of Exhibit "BB" were false, reiterating that Johnny <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> had no participation whatsoever in the crime as he
alone perpetrated the heinous act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>, testifying in his own
defense, stated that on August 6, 1967 at about 12:00 noon, he was in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Pola</span> where he met
Ernesto Imperial who sought his assistance in collecting a debt in <span class="SpellE">Putingtubig</span>; that he and Imperial went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> at <span class="SpellE">Putingtubig</span>, arriving there at around 3:00 o'clock in the
afternoon; that upon finding that <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> was out,
they talked with his wife, <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> Hernandez; that
they waited for <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> until about 6:00 o'clock in
the afternoon; that when <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> arrived, he asked
them to go inside the house; that inside the house, Ernesto Imperial asked <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> to pay his debt, but instead of answering his
request, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> invited them to join him in drinking
beer; that a nephew of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> arrived with a jar of
"tuba", which was mixed with beer, which mixture they drank; that
while they were drinking, Imperial reminded <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
of his indebtedness, but <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> evaded the matter,
saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Let us talk about that
later"; that the drinking spree lasted until 8:00 o'clock when <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> invited them to eat; that he refused the invitation
and so he was left in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the house; that he
saw <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> and Imperial whispering to each other;
that upon hearing the sound of a body falling to the floor, he went into the
kitchen and saw <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> on the floor, and Imperial
was holding a gun with his left hand, while he held a bolo on the right hand;
that Imperial immediately poked the gun at him and told him not to move; that
he was taken aback when Impe­rial wrested his gun from his possession and
ordered him to move to the other side of the kitchen; that afterwards when the
wife of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> went down the stairs, he saw Imperial
going towards the woman, hitting her on the head with the gun, then stabbing
her several times; that after stabbing <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span>
Hernandez, Imperial dragged a boy upstairs and it was at this time that he
escaped for <span class="SpellE">Pola</span>, finally reaching the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> at about 3:00 o'clock in the morning; that the
following day, he reported what happened in <span class="SpellE">Putingtubig</span>
to his chief, <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> Francisco, informing the latter
that Ernesto Imperial was the assailant of the deceased; that he learned of his
involvement in the case in the afternoon of August 7, 1967 when Imperial
implicated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that it was
Imperial alone who committed the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the brief of appellant Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
is that the trial court should not have given much weight and credence to the testimony
of Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> as it was highly improbable for
Imperial and <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>, who were newly acquainted with
each other, to have entered into a conspiracy to commit such a grave offense,
especially since <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> himself was a police
officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also argued that if
there was a conspiracy between the two, Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>
would have been liquidated immediately instead of being hogtied, since they
would have anticipated that he was a possible eyewitness to the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> further contended that the
testimony of Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> contained various
contradictions which impaired his credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it is claimed that on direct examination, <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>
testified that Imperial was first ordered at gunpoint by <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
to kill <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span>, but on cross examination he made no
mention of the order allegedly made by <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>, but
stated that the stabbing of the victim was so sudden and unexpected that he
(Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>) and the appellant <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
were caught by surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further
asserted that on direct examination, <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> stated
that while Imperial was hacking <span class="SpellE">Jalothot</span> with the
bolo, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
was poking the gun at Imperial, but on cross-examination he said that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> was poking his gun not at
Imperial but at <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the contention of appellant <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>, it appeared that the two
have known each other for sometime prior to the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the past criminal record of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>, it is not improbable for <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> to have participated in the
commission of the afore-stated crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> was hogtied
but not liquidated could be easily explained by the fact that at the time of
the incident, he was but a fra­gile boy of twelve years of age, posing no
immediate danger to the successful consummation of appellant's criminal
enterprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is borne by the fact
that Imperial admitted in his testimony that it never <span class="SpellE">occured</span>
to him that <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> would be used as a witness for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the alleged
contradictions of <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>, it must be noted that the
alleged incon­sistencies are more apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, he was asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Q<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As</span> a matter of fact, the stabbing was
so sudden, that you as well as the accused <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> were caught by surprise for
what Imperial did, am I correct?" He answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, sir." Obviously, <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> was referring to himself alone and not to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>, as the one caught by
surprise, for certainly he could not have divined the mind of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the circumstance that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> pointed his gun at Imperial
to prod him to hack <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> does not necessarily
rule out the possibi­lity that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
later poked his gun at <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> to prevent him from
shouting for help.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has repeatedly declared that rela­tively minor
inconsistencies between the testimony of various witnesses or in the testimony
of the same witness do not affect their basic credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has also noted that an intelligent
boy is undoubtedly the best observer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
is little in­fluenced by the suggestion of others and describes objects and
occurrences as he has really seen them.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the young <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> clearly and
unhesitatingly narrated the events on the night in question, and positively
described the different overt acts of the two appellants in the perpetration of
this heinous offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
in the record from which this Court could infer or deduce any improper motive
on the part of this witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this
Court has held in various cases that absence of evidence as to any improper
motive which may influence a principal witness for the prosecution strongly
tends to sustain the conclusion that no such motive existed and his testi­mony
is worthy of full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, there is reasonableness and cogency in the testimony of Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span>, and in the manner he answered the questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, his testimony is corroborated by
the other evidence, <i>viz</i>.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Celedonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Orilla</span>,
the findings of the police authorities, and the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
physical facts, such as the nature and location of the wounds of the two
victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that the trial court aptly observed that <span class="SpellE">Valera's</span> testimony was a mere repro­duction of the
testimony of his co-accused Imperial which, according to said court, cannot be
given credence because of the "overwhelming evidence of the prosecution
pointing to him as the real culprit who masterminded the overall plan to
liquidate the victims and to rob them * * *." Neither is Ernesto
Imperial's testimony availing to support <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
defense, nor was it worthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be recalled that Imperial was taken from the peniten­tiary to
testify for <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
precisely to completely exculpate the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, previous to this, Imperial had declared under oath, on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1967</st1:date>, that <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> instigated the commission
of the crime and actively participated therein (Exhibit "BB").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Imperial at first, on <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1971</st1:date>, attempted to impugn
this statement, he later, on <st1:date year="1972" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1972</st1:date>, affirmed the veracity thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such inconsis­tent and contradictory
statements made under oath, does not certainly argue in favor of the credibility
of the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There cannot be any doubt, therefore, that ap­pellant <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> participated in the killing
and robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Merza</span>
pointed to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>
as the person who directed Imperial to hack <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> with a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
who according to <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Merza</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> struck the head of the wife of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> with his gun after she was stabbed by
Imperial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is corroborated by
the lacerated wounds found on the left parietal region of the head of <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also appellant <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> who dragged the
young Orlando <span class="SpellE">Merza</span> to the second floor of the house
where he was hogtied and then <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> ransacked the
house and the store, where he got some money, a few pieces of jewelry, a
"Columbia" transistor radio, and the Caliber .22 gun of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall now consider the case of Ernesto Impe­rial.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, on November 28, 1972, Ernesto Imperial was
re-arraigned under the Information filed by Fiscal Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>
and pleaded guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Describing the proceedings anent the new re-arraignment of
appellant Ernesto Imperial on Novem­ber 28, 1972, the lower court said:</p>

<blockquote>"When the case was called for the arraign­ment of the accused,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>, <i>de
<span class="SpellE">oficio</span> </i>counsel, manifested that he was ready,
stating further that he has conferred with the accused <span class="GramE">who</span>
signified his intention to enter a plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the court addressing the accused
Ernesto Imperial, asked the latter if he had really conferred with his counsel
and if it was true that he intimated to said counsel that he was entering a
plea of guilty, the accused answered in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court likewise told the accused that he
was charged of a very serious offense and a plea of guilty may mean his being
sentenced to death, to which the accused answered that he was aware of that,
likewise sta­ting that he knew the consequences of his enter­ing a voluntary
plea of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it was made
clear that even before leaving <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> for <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span> to be re-<span class="GramE">arraigned,</span>
his mind was already fixed that he would enter a plea of guilty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, the prosecuting fiscal moved that after the
arraignment the accused be placed on the witness stand for interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the court ordered the
re-arraignment of the accused and the Deputy Clerk of Court read the
information in the <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> dialect and after having
been heard and understood the same, the accused stated 'I plead guilty, sir.',
so that the Court acting on the motion of the prosecuting fiscal, ordered the
accused to be placed on the witness stand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Answering questions of the Prosecuting Fiscal, the accused
admitted that on August 7, 1967, in the presence of Judge Villanueva and
Assistant Provincial Fiscal Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span>, he
executed an affidavit marked Exhibit 'BB' for the prosecution, said accused
having been confronted with the copy of said affidavit and after examin­ing the
same, the accused answered in the affirm­ative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, the whole affidavit was read to him and he admitted that the
questions stated in the same were really asked of him and that the answers
appearing therein were also the answers that he made during the taking of the
said affi­davit and then categorically affirmed the truth and correctness of
the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court then proceeded and asked the accused whether he
remembers that on August 9, 1971 he was present in Court by virtue of a
subpoena issued for his appearance to be a witness in the case of People of the
Philippines versus Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> to which he answered
in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reminded that in his
testimony on that date, he assumed the sole responsibility for the death of <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> and <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> Hernandez, he said that he made that narration of
admission because of the promise of Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> that
if he would solely own the crime committed, he would be com­pensated in the
amount of P300,000.00 and as his mind was then confused, thinking that he had
no more future on the account of the penalty of death against him, he testified
in the manner he did, at the same time admitting that his testimony on August
9, 1971 in favor of Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>, was not altogether
correct, having been only promised a reward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Asked by the court where he was promised such reward, he said that it
was in the P.C. bar­racks at <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, but he did not receive the amount.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, he affirmed the truth of the affidavit that was
read to him by Fiscal Enriquez and said that he was retracting the testimony
that he gave before the Court on August 9, 1971 in connection with his
testimony in favor of Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>, and emphasized
that he was indeed retract­ing and that he was not telling the whole truth,
stating further that his testimony this time, from his re-arraignment up to the
last question propounded by the court, was the truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense counsel then manifested that he had no questions
to ask, whereupon, the court ordered the case submitted for decision and the
accused be brought back to the national peniten­tiary at <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of appellant's plea of guilty, the lower court convicted
him as aforesaid of the crime charged and imposed upon him the death penalty
with the same recommendation for commutation of sentence to life
imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, appellant's
case is before this Court for automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant in his brief claims that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not receiving evidence in order to be
reasonably certain that no injustice was be­ing done to the accused; and (2) in
failing to in­form him of the nature of the charge against him, and therefore,
prayed that the decision of the lower court dated February 22, 1973 be set
aside and the case remanded anew to the lower court for further proceedings
conformably with the procedure laid down by this Court incase of a plea of
guilty for a cap­ital offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in capital offenses where a plea of guilty is
entered by the accused, "the court must assure itself that he is fully
aware of the implications of said plea and that, to this end, it may or should
take some evidence to be reasonably certain that no injustice is done to
him."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, however, it appears from the record that
appellant had full knowledge of the meaning and extent of his plea of guilty,
as shown by the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>his testimony before the trial court on August 9, 1971, admitting that
he stabbed and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> and stabbed several times <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> Hernandez; and his actuations during his
re-arraignment on November 28, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, after his plea of guilty, he was placed on the witness stand and
after he was confronted with his extrajudicial admissions contained in his
affidavit (Exhibit "BB") which he executed on August 7, 1967 before
Judge <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> D. Villanueva and Fiscal Ramon B. <span class="SpellE">Añonuevo</span> at <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>, Oriental
<span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> he clearly and categorically affirmed the
truth and correctness of his aforesaid confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he retracted his testimony on August
9, 1971 wherein he owned solely the commission of the crime is not indicative
of the truth because of Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera's</span> assurance that
he will pay him P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, such admissions and overt
acts show clearly that appellant fully understood the meaning and implication
of his plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">As explained by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>"True it is that, as pointed out by the appellant under his
second assignment of error in this appeal, this Honorable Court has repeatedly
admonished that trial judges must 'be extra soli­citous in seeing to it that
when an accused pleads guilty, he understands fully the meaning of his plea and
the import of an inevitable conviction' (People v. <span class="SpellE">Busa</span>,
51 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 317, 320); and that trial courts should
explain to the accused the meaning of the allegations regarding conspiracy and
the aggravating circumstances of treachery, etc., which are 'terms so technical
that the layman' cannot possibly understand them (People v. Sil­vestre, 51 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 286; People v. <span class="SpellE">Alamada</span>, 52 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 103).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is
equally true that, as borne out by the 9-page transcript of stenographic notes
of the second trial of the case against appellant Imperial, the court <i>a quo</i>
again did not follow and adhere strictly to the guidelines set forth by this
Honorable Court in the cases herein cited and other similar cases, because the
presiding judge (The Honorable <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Bleza</span>, who suc­ceeded the then presiding judge, the
Honorable <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> N. Beltran, now retired and the one
who penned the decision that was set aside by this Honorable Court in L-30039,
supra.) did not himself explain to the appellant the precise nature of the
charge against the latter, especially the allegations of conspiracy in the
information herein for robbery with double homicide, and the meaning and legal
significations of the aggravating cir­cumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>,
treachery, superior strength, cruelty, craft, abuse of confidence, and dwelling
also alleged in said information; and neither did the trial court assure itself
that the latter clearly and fully understood the dire­ful consequences of his
plea of guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these flaws in the <span class="SpellE">rearraignment</span> of appellant Imperial do not detract from his
unequivocal admission in his sworn statement <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'BB' that he did hack the deceased <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Jalotjot</span> while the latter was already in a defenseless
position, so that he could and should be made accountable still for the crime
of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is precisely because
appellant's plea of guilty does not appear to be unconditional, qualified as it
is by his affidavit <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'BB', that</span>
undersigned counsel have herein expressed the view that by his plea of guilty,
appellant Imperial should only be considered to have admitted such allegations
in the information as were likewise admitted by him in his said sworn statement
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'BB'."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of appellants Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
and Ernesto Imperial of the crime of Robbery with Double Homicide has been proven
beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature and number of aggravating circumstances proven by the
prosecution warrants the impo­sition of the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the commission of the crime was
accompanied by the aggravating cir­cumstances listed in the Information,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">noc­turnity</span>,
treachery, superior strength, cruelty, craft, abuse of confidence and dwelling,
aside from that of recidivism insofar as Julio <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>
is con­cerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, however, that aside from <span class="SpellE">Valera's</span>
recidivism, only the aggravating circumstances of treachery, dwelling and abuse
of confidence or obvious ungratefulness may be appreciated against the
accused-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nocturnity</span>,
abuse of superior strength and craft are absorbed in treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruelty has not been proven, there being no
showing that the accused, for their pleasure and satisfaction, caused the
victims to suffer slowly and gra­dually and inflicted on them unnecessary moral
and physical pain.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends, however, that appellant
Imperial's plea of guilty should be considered, "not as a total confession
of guilt to the crime charged herein, as well as an admission of conspiracy and
all the aggravating circumstances alleged in the information, but only as an
admission of his having hacked the deceased in the neck with a bolo, together
with the aggravating circumstances of <span class="SpellE"><i>alevosia</i></span>,
since he admittedly hacked the deceased when he was already wounded and unable
to defend himself." In sum, the Solicitor General's assess­ment is that appellant
Ernesto Imperial is guilty, not of the crime of Robbery with Double Homicide,
but of Murder qualified by treachery, with no aggra­vating circumstance and
with the mitigating circum­stance of plea of guilty, and therefore the penalty
of death imposed by the trial court should be re­duced to <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree with the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is that while an unqualified plea of
guilty is mitigating, it, at the same time, constitutes an admission of all the
material facts alleged in the information, including the aggravating
circumstances therein recited.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In such a case, the prosecution need not prove said circumstances since the
accused, by his plea of guilty, has already supplied the re­quisite proof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, <span class="GramE">We</span> are not in accord with the
obser­vation of the Solicitor General that the crime com­mitted by Imperial was
Murder, qualified by treach­ery, and not Robbery with Double Homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence has sufficiently shown that
after Imperial had stabbed the victim and <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> had
stabbed and struck the victim's wife, <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> and
Imperial ransacked the house and then went downstairs and also ransacked the
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the course of the
investigation of the crime by the police autho­rities, they were able to
recover the Caliber .22 gun belonging to the victim at the place indicated by
Imperial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transistor radio of the
victims was likewise recovered with the help of Imperial's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances sufficiently indicate
that the crime committed by Imperial was Robbery with Double Homicide, and not
Murder qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
considering that Imperial's plea of guilty is insufficient to offset the
aggravating circumstances of treachery, dwelling and abuse of confidence or
obvious ungratefulness which attended the commission of the offense,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the penalty of death has been properly imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note, however, that the trial court, having observed appellant's
demeanor and remorse recommended to the President that the penalty of death
imposed be commuted to life imprisonment.</p>
