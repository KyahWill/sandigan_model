Civil Case No. Q-8645, denying the petition to restrain the Chief of the
Philippine Constabulary and the PC Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
and their agents from <span class="SpellE">interferring</span> with and
obstructing the operation of the La Loma Cockpit on days authorized by
Ordinance No. 64-5990 of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Council.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1960</st1:date>,
the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, pursuant to Section
80 of its Charter, Republic Act No. 537, enacted Ordinance No. 60-4346,
allowing the holding of cockfighting on Saturdays in the City after payment of
the prescribed fees and compliance with the requirements mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By authority there­of, the petitioners
applied for, and were granted a permit by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Mayor to hold cockfights at the La Loma Cockpit on Saturdays of every
week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the then Chief of the
Criminal Investigation Service of the Philippine Constabulary ordered the petitioners
to stop the holding of cockfights on said days, and as a result, the
petitioners filed an action for declaratory relief with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Branch, which was docketed therein as Spec. Civil Action No. 6446.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the court rendered judgment
holding that Ordinance No. 60-4346 is illegal and null and void, being <u>ultra</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1964</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Council passed Ordinance No. 64-5990,
authorizing the City Mayor to issue permits to hold cockfights on Saturdays and
certain legal holidays and other week days upon payment of the pre­scribed
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon application, the petitioners
were granted a permit to hold cockfights at the La Loma Cockpit on Saturdays,
and certain weekdays, more particularly, on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in the morning of the said day, the PC Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> ordered the petitioners not to hold cockfights on
said day, otherwise, the cockpit would be raided and closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, on March 18, 1965, the petitioners filed
a petition for injunction with the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch, to
restrain the Chief of the Philippine Consta­bulary and the PC Provincial
Commander of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> from <span class="SpellE">interferring</span>
with and in any manner obstructing the opera­tions of the La Loma Cockpit on
dates authorized by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Mayor pursuant to
Ordinance No. 64-5990 of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Council.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondents moved to dismiss the petition upon the grounds that Ordinance
No. 64-5990 of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Council is null and void,
citing this Court's decision in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Quimsing</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span>;</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the action is barred by the prior judgment rendered in Special Civil
Action No. 6446, where­in the court declared Ordinance No. 60-4346 of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Council, allowing the petitioners to hold
cockfighting on Saturdays of each week at the La Loma Cockpit, null and void,
being <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The court, however, denied the motion to dismiss on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1965</st1:date> and ordered the issuance of a writ
of preliminary injunction upon the filing of a bond in the amount of P5,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1965</st1:date>,
the respondents filed their answer to the petition, with a motion for the
reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1965</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1965</st1:date>, the
parties sub­mitted a stipulation of facts wherein they agreed that:</p>

<blockquote>"1. The La Loma
Cockpit, owned by the petitioners, has the corresponding per­mit to conduct a
cockpit for the year 1965, as shown by a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span>
copy of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Mayor's Permit No. 544-46 marked
Annex 'A' hereof, and has paid the muni­cipal license fee for the first quarter
of 1965, shown by a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of the receipt of
payment of P1,500.00 marked An­nex 'A-1' hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City granted petitioners the permission to hold cockfighting at the La Loma
Cockpit on March 11, 1965, as shown by the corres­ponding permit, a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of which is marked as Annex 'B' hereof, and
the municipal license fee <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the sum of
P100.00 was paid, as shown by a <span class="SpellE">pho­tostat</span> copy of
the receipt thereof marked as Annex 'B-1' hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Municipal License No. 65-L-285 was issued by
the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span> City to the La Loma
Cockpit for the operation of a cockpit for the year 1965, as shown by a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy thereof marked Annex 'C' hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The municipal license fee for the second
quarter of 1965 has been paid by petitioners, as shown by a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span>
copy of the corresponding receipt marked Annex 'D' hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the cockpit of the petition­ers has
been found structurally safe by the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, as shown by a certificate, a <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copy of
which is marked Annex 'E' hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Health Department of <span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span>
City has found the cockpit building of the petitioners to have met sanitary re­quirements,
as shown by <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copies of the Certificate of
Inspection marked Annex 'F' hereof; Record of Final Inspection marked Annex
'F-1' hereof; Certificate of Occupancy marked Annex 'F-2' hereof, and Sanitary
Permit marked Annex 'F-3' hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the morning of March 11, 1965, after the
La Loma Cockpit was opened for cockfighting operations but be­fore any
cockfighting was done, a P.C. Officer, in representation of the respon­dent
P.C. Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, came to said
cockpit and gave notice to the persons in charge that cockfighting on that days
was illegal and, unless the La Loma Cockpit desisted from operating said
cockpit on that day, the P.C. would raid the place and stop operations therein;
accordingly, the petitioners refrained to hold any cockfighting that day, although
they had the corresponding permit of the City Mayor, as shown by Annex 'B' here­of,
but the same P.C. officer assured the undersigned counsel for the petitioners
that the P.C. Provincial Commander of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> would see
counsel in the afternoon of the same day to discuss the matter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of March 11, 1965,
undersigned counsel for the petition­ers saw the said respondent P.C. Provin­cial
Commander at his headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and the latter informed counsel that cockfighting on
Mondays, Wed­nesdays, Thursdays and Fridays was illegal according to the
opinion of the Solicitor General so that, unless the petitioners could obtain a
judicial injunction like that obtained by cockpit operators in the adjoin­ing
municipalities, the P.C. would raid the La Loma Cockpit if it was operated on
those dates, and this was notwithstanding Ordinance No. 5990 of Quezon City and
the permit granted by the Mayor's Office of Quezon City;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City Mayor of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> had not given the
respondents any written request to stop operations of the La Loma Cockpit on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1965</st1:date> or on any other dates
authorized under Ordinance No. 5990;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Civil Case No. 6446 of this Hon. Court,
entitled "The testate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Guison</span> versus Col. Jose <span class="SpellE">Maristela</span>,

the Philippine Constabulary", for declaratory relief, judgment was
rendered declaring null and void Ordinance No. 60­-4346 of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City and no appeal from said judgment was perfected;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein petitioners succeeded as heirs to
the said estate of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Guizon</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="1">January

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing stipulation of facts and the
memoranda submitted by the parties, the court, on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1965</st1:date>, issued an order denying the petition
for lack of cause of action and lifted the writ of preliminary injunction
previously issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>

but the court denied the said motion on <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="12">December

however, stayed the lifting of the writ of preliminary injunction pending

<p class="BODY">The appeal is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The action is injunctive, and, in a way, prospective, seeking to
restrain the respon­dents from <span class="SpellE">interferring</span> with and
obstructing the operation of the La Loma Cockpit in any of the date or dates
authorized by Ordinance No. 64-5990 of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the rendition of the
judgment in this case, however, certain events took place and several laws have
been enacted re­pealing the ordinance relied upon by the petitioners, as to
render the issues raised by them moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the appellants claim that under the
Charter of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, the police or law enforcement
authority is vested exclusively upon the City Mayor, and the intervention of
the Philippine Constabulary and other police agencies in the maintenance of
peace and order or in law enforcement within the City is permissible only if
the City Mayor requests their as­sistance where public interest and safety
require it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, upon the issuance
of Proclamation 1081 on September 21, 1972, placing the country under martial
law, and the subsequent enactment of Presidential Decree Nos. 421, 482, 531,
641, and 765, integrating the police forces, jails, and fire departments, and
placing them under the administra­tive supervision and control of the Chief,
Philippine Consta­bulary, as Director General of the Integrated National
Police, the issue is moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issues raised were likewise rendered moot and academic with the
enactment of Presidential Decree No. 449, otherwise named as the Cockfighting
Law of 1974, which gave the Chief of the Philippine Constabulary the authority
to supervise the holding of cockfights and the operation and main­tenance of
cockpits.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether or not the permit issued by the <span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span>
City Mayor to the petitioners to hold cockfighting at the La Loma Cockpit on
weekdays, pursuant to Ordinance No. 64-5990, is valid, the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Quimsing</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

are in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said cases, this Court
ruled that an ordinance authorizing the holding of cockfighting or <span class="SpellE">pintakasi</span> at the discretion of the municipal mayor on days
other than those authorized under Sections 2285 and 2286 of the Revised
Administrative Code, is null and void, despite the provisions of Republic Act
No. 938 authorizing the municipal or city board or council of the municipality
to regulate the establishment, maintenance and operation of cockpits within its
territorial jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the per­mit
to hold cockfighting on weekdays was issued pursuant to an invalid ordinance,
the petitioners have no cause of action.</p>
