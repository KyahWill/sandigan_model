				<H3>DOMINGO Z. VILLACARLOS, PETITIONER, VS. HON. JOSE B. JIMENEZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAVITE. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF TERNATE, CAVITE AND BAYANI CATAMISAN, AS AFFECTED CANDIDATE, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the regular elections held on November 10, 1959 petitioner Domingo Z. 
Villacarlos and respondent Bayani Catamisan were registered candidates for the 
office of municipal mayor of Ternate, Cavite. On the following November 21 
Villacarlos filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Cavite, 
docketed as case No. 57, for recounting of the ballots in three precincts of the 
said municipality (Nos. 1-A, 5 and 6) pursuant to sections 163 and 168 of the 
Revised Election Code, on the ground of alleged discrepancies as to number of 
votes between the election returns and the certificates of election results 
issued by the board of election inspectors to the watchers in those precincts, 
in accordance with section 153 of the same Code. As prayed for in the petition 
the court, presided by respondent Hon. Jose B. Jimenez, issued a writ of 
preliminary injunction on November 23, 1959 to restrain tjbe municipal board of 
canvassers from proclaiming the winning candidate for mayor of the municipality 
of Ternate.
<p>Respondent Bayani Catamisan filed an opposition to petition, interposing 
affirmative defenses, namely, that the certificates of election results alleged 
in the petition are not authentic documents referred to in Sections 163 and 168 
of the Revised Election Code; that such certificates of election results are 
falsified, altered, unofficial and/or self-serving statements; and that the 
ballot boxes in Precincts 1-A and 6 had been tampered with and the integrity of 
their contents had been destroyed or corrupted and so would not reflect the will 
of the electorate who voted. In the course of the hearing of the petition 
evidence was introduced by respondent to prove the alleged tampering of the 
ballot boxes. Petitioner objected on the ground that the evidence was immaterial 
and irrelevant, since the jurisdiction of the Court was limited to the 
ministerial act of recounting the votes and did not extend to an inquiry into 
the commission of election anomalies, which should be ventilated in an election 
protest. The court overruled the objection and permitted the evidence to be 
received. A motion to strike out was thereafter filed but was denied, as was 
also the subsequent motion to reconsider.</p>
<p>On December 29, 1959 Domingo Villacarios filed the instant petition for 
certiorari and prohibition praying that the rulings and resolutions of 
respondent court allowing the introduction of evidence concerning the alleged 
tampering of the ballot boxes and denying petitioner's motion to strike out be 
set aside and annulled and that said court be ordered to desist from allowing 
further evidence on the point to be presented. A writ of preliminary injunction 
was issued by us on January 25, 1960, to restrain respondent court from 
continuing with the trial of the main case until further orders. Before the writ 
could be served, however, respondent Court, on the basis of our decision in the 
case of Jose Parlade, Jr., et al. vs. Hon. Perfecto Quicho, et al., G. R. No. 
L-16259, Dec. 29, 1959, dismissed the petition pending before it and lifted the 
writ of preliminary injunction it had previously issued. As a result respondent 
Bayani Catamisan was, on January 26, 1960, proclaimed mayor by the Municipal 
Board of Canvassers of Ternate. No appeal or petition for review was taken by 
any of the parties from the order of dismissal, and in their respective 
manifestations subsequently filed before this Court they in effect admitted that 
the issue involved in the instant petition has become academic and moot, 
although petitioner asks that it be decided on the merits nevertheless, so that 
a guide for future litigation may be laid down. We believe the reason given by 
petitioner is not weighty enough to justify a disregard of the established 
general rule that moot issues, which affect no rights of the parties, are not 
proper for adjudication by the courts. In any event, consideration of the 
question posed by petitioner is barred by the defense of lack of jurisdiction on 
the part of respondent court to order a recount of the ballots cast in the three 
precincts involved. The Parlade case, <i>supra</i>, has definitely settled that 
the discrepancy in number of votes mentioned in section 163 of the Revised 
Election Code, which would justify a recount, has reference to the number of 
votes appearing in different copies of the election returns required by section 
150, and not to the discrepancy between the election returns and any certificate 
given by the board of inspectors to the watchers who may request them under 
section 153.</p>
<p>The petition is dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. 
B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>Regala, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
