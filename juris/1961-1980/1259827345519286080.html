				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, Hon. Ramon O. 
Nolasco, presiding, finding accused-appellant Federico Cortes guilty of treason 
and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of fifteen years of <i>reclusión 
temporal</i>, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to pay a fine 
of P2,000, with costs. The case was first appealed to the Court of Appeals, but 
the latter forwarded it to this court on the ground that the crime proved is 
punishable by life imprisonment. The trial court found him guilty on count Nos. 
1 and 7 of the information, which counts are as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That during the period from June 1942 to the landing of the American 
Liberation Forces in Cebu, for the purpose of giving and with intent to give aid 
and/or comfort to the enemy, the above-named accused, FEDERICO CORTES 
<i>alias</i> PEDRING CORTES, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously act and serve as member of the puppet Cebu Police Force and later on 
of the Bureau of 'Constabulary of the puppet Republic of the Philippines with 
the rank of corporal and at the same time as agent and informer of the Japanese 
Military Police (Kempei Tai) in the City of Cebu, and as such, made reports to 
the Japanese Kempei Tai as to the movements and activities of guerillas and 
prominent persons in the Province of Cebu and participated in the apprehension 
and arrest of guerrillas." (Count No. 1)<br>"That sometime in 1942, for the 
purpose of giving and with intent to give aid and/or comfort to the enemy, the 
above-named accused, FEDERICO CORTES <i>alias</i> PEDRING CORTES, did then and 
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously arrest and apprehend Fernando 
Macasero on the charge of having contraband goods in his possession, and did 
turn him over to Sgt. Mori of the Japanese Military Police (Kempei Tai); that 
said Fernando Macasero was sent to Manila by the Japanese where he was 
court-martialed and sentenced to serve an imprisonment for one year." (Count No. 
7)</p></blockquote>
<p>The evidence submitted by the prosecution to prove count No. 7 consists of 
the testimonies of witnesses Fernando Macasero, his wife Teodora Alisna, and 
Cornelio Barcelo. Macasero testified that in the morning of August 28, 1942, 
appellant Federico Cortes went to his house at Carcar, Cebu, and asked him to 
change a P20 Cebu emergency money with bills of small denominations and, if 
possible, with some treasury notes. Macasero granted this request and gave 
Cortes, in exchange, ten P1 emergency notes and two P5 Philippine treasury 
notes. On the following Sunday Cortes again came to his house, driving a car, 
accompanied by a Japanese interpreter and two Japanese officials. The car driven 
by Cortes was followed by a truck loaded with Japanese soldiers. Upon arrival, 
the soldiers immediately surrounded a house near that of Maoasero. Cortes told 
hia companions that that was not the house of Macasero, then pointed to 
Macasero's own house. So the Japanese officials, the interpreter and Cortes went 
up the house and got all the money that Macasero kept in a drawer, amounting to 
around P6,000. It was Cortes, who pointed to the drawer where the money was 
being kept.</p>
<p>After that Cortes tied the hands of Macasero together, after which all of 
them went down. Macasero was ordered to board the truck, which he did. From 
there he was brought to the school building. Once there he was accused of 
exchanging money with the guerrillas hiding in the mountains. The Japanese 
soldiers and Cortes beat him with a wooden stick, as a result of which he 
sustained a wound on the right side of the head. After the investigation and 
beating he was brought to Cebu City and after a month and seven days there he 
was brought to Manila and confined in Muntinglupa prison, and was not released 
until April 29, 1943 on the occasion of a holiday in honor of the Japanese 
emperor.</p>
<p>His wife Teodora Alisna declared that on August 28, 1942. Cortes went to 
their house to have a P20 bill changed to small denominations, and that they 
accommodated him; that at that time they had P6,000 in their drawer; that the 
following day appellant Cortes came with Japanese soldiers, went up their house 
and investigated her husband, imputing or charging him with having obtained the 
money amounting to P6,000 from the guerrillas; that after the investigation, 
Cortes tied his hands, and then he was brought down, and asked to board a truck, 
and later brought to the ^choolbuilding; that she did not actually see what 
happened to her husband in the school although she heard groans coming from 
inside the building; that, thereafter, he was brought to Cebu City and was not 
released until after April 29, 1943.</p>
<p>Cornelio Barcelo corroborated the statements of Macasero and his wife, as to 
the coming of the Japanese soldiers to Macasero's house. He declared that it was 
his house that was first surrounded by the Japanese soldiers, but that Cortes 
informed them that that was not the house of Fernando Macasero; that upon being 
told where the house of Macasero was, the soldiers went to surround it. He did 
not see what happened inside the house of Macasero, but after a while he saw the 
soldiers and Macasero and his wife come down, and then the two were asked to 
board the truck with Japanese soldiers, while the accused Cortes and the 
Japanese officials rode in the car. He further declared that he saw the hands of 
Macasero being tied together by Cortes himself; that he followed the truck and 
the car to the place where Macasero was brought, which was only about half a 
kilometer away; that there he saw Fernando Macasero being beaten by Cortes with 
a wooden stick; that the place where the beating took place was in the 
schoolbuilding of Carcar, Cebu province.</p>
<p>Appellant Cortes does not deny that he was with the Japanese soldiers when 
they took Macasero down from his house and brought him to the Carcar 
schoolbuilding. He said that he went to investigate Macasero in the latter part 
of June, in his house in Carcar, which was near the Japanese garrison; that he 
told Macasero that he had been reported, as the head of a band of robbers and 
looters, which accusation Macasero denied; that after this he went down and 
proceeded to Cebu City; that he did not go up the house as charged but only 
stayed in the truck and waited until Macasero was brought down the house by the 
Japanese. It is to be noted that ,Cortes has not offered any witness to 
corroborate his denial, nor did he deny that it was he who had indicated the 
house of Macasero to the Japanese soldiers. His admission that he investigated 
Macasero and that Macasero was taken by the Japanese indicates that he must have 
been the one who had denounced Macasero to the Japanese. As he admits that he 
was entrusted with investigating Macasero, he must have used the Japanese 
technique of investigation, that is, by beating the one being investigated. We 
find that the testimony of Macasero that he was beaten by Cortes, as 
corroborated by the testimony of Barcelo who saw the actual beating, is true. 
We, therefore, lind that count No. 7 of the information has been proved beyond 
reasonable doubt by two competent witnesses to the same overt act.</p>
<p>As to the first count, two witnesses also testified, namely, Diego Cañiza and 
Marceiino Veloso. Cañiza testified that he was chief of the secret service of 
the City of Cebu during the Japanese occupation from June 9, 1942; that Cortes 
worked with him for four months until October 4, 1042,. when Cañiza resigned as 
chief of the secret service division; that during the four months that Cañiza 
was chief of the secret service, Cortes was detailed to the Japanese military 
police, working directly under one Captain Mori; that he used to see Cortes 
going with the Japanese military patrol; that in the beginning he did not know 
what the work of Cortes with the Japanese military police, known as the Kempei 
Tai, was, but later on, when the Kempei Tai began arresting suspected 
guerrillas, he came to know that Cortes acted as spy or undercover agent.</p>
<p>Marcelino Veloso testified that he was a clerk in the provincial jail and 
that he knew the accused. Cortes admitted to him that he was a Filipino citizen 
when accused signed the document Exhibit "A". This witness, however, did not 
testify to any overt act of treason committed by appellant.</p>
<p>Another witness identified.two documents, Exhibits "B" and "C", apparently 
signed by the appellant, which are reports on the movements of certain persons 
under suspicion and surveillance. The accused denied the authenticity of his 
signature to these documents. We are of the belief that his signatures thereon 
are authentic, because they are similar to the authentic signature appearing in 
Exhibit "A". These documents are indicative of the activities of appellant 
Cortes, as spy and undercover of the Japanese Kempei Tai.</p>
<p>Another witness presented to prove the first count is Lini Beng Liong, who 
declared that in the month of September or October, 1944, while he was walking 
along Jungera street, he met Federico Cortes who asked him to sign a piece of 
paper and, at the same time, ordered him to go to the Philippine Constabulary 
headquarters that afternoon; that upon reporting to said headquarters as he was 
told to do, he was asked to work the following morning at Yate airfield; that he 
asked to be excused, but his request was denied; that he and certain companions 
of his were* brought in a truck to Yate airfield and there required to make 
excavations for the Japanese; that these excavations were found by him later to 
have been used by the Japanese for hiding military supplies, ammunitions and 
properties.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted to prove the first count, is to the effect that Cortes 
was a member of the Japanese Kempei Tai, engaged in spying on suspected persons, 
and in helping secure labor for Japanese defense works. Membership in the Kempei 
Tai was proved by the testimony of Cafriza. The act of spying is also proved by 
the reports signed by Cortes, Exhibits "B" and "C"; that of securing labor to 
help in the building of Japanese defenses was proved by Lim Beng Liong. But 
while each of the above acts of helping the enemy is competent by itself, the 
three are riot sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the evidence or 
testimonies of at least two witnesses must be to the same overt act. (People 
<i>vs</i>. Adriano, 78 Phil., 561; 44 Off. Gaz., No. 11, p. 4300, People 
<i>vs</i>. Abad, 78 Phil., 766; 44 Off. Gaz., No. 12, p. 4901; People <i>vs</i>. 
Tan Mateo, 80 Phil., 211; 45 Off. Gaz., No. 8, p. 3323). We are, therefore, 
constrained to hold that the evidence submitted to prove count No. 1 is not 
sufficient to satisfy the two-witness rule on treason.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, we find tihat the accused-appellant 
Federico Cortes is guilty of treason on count No. 7 alone. However, we find that 
the penalty imposed by the trial court is commensurate with the nature of the 
act of treason committed. Hence, the decision appealed from is hereby 
affirmed.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
