				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before Us is a <span style="">verified
petition praying </span>for the <span style="">is­</span>suance
of the writs of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition, with an additional prayer
for the <span style="">immediate </span>issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction, filed by <span class="SpellE">Dimalomping</span> <span class="SpellE">Macud</span> against the Commission on Elections - hereinafter
referred <span style="">to as COMELEC -, the Municipal
Board of Canvassers of the Municipality </span>of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> - <span style="">hereinafter referred </span>to as the Board -
and <span class="SpellE">Aliodin</span> <span class="SpellE">Gani</span> <span class="SpellE">Noor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Purpose of the action as one for certiorari is to annul: the
resolution of COMELEC of January 10, 1968 sustaining the proclamation of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Noor</span> as Municipal Mayor <span style="">elect of </span>the abovementioned
municipality <span class="GramE">made</span> by the Board on December 29, 1967;
of another resolution of COMELEC dated January 18, 1968 denying <span class="SpellE">Macud's</span> motion for <span style="">reconsideration
and reiterat­ing its </span>resolution of January 10, and, finally, to declare
void the proclamation mentioned heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Purpose
of the action as one for prohibition is to restrain respondent <span class="SpellE">Noor</span> from taking oath and/or assuming office as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and, in case he had already taken oath and assumed
office, from discharging the duties thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The action, as one for
mandamus, seeks to compel the Board to take cognizance of the writ of
preliminary in­junction issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, 15th Judicial
District, Branch I, pending reso­lution of the petition for judicial recount
filed therewith by <span class="SpellE">Macud</span>; to reconvene as Board of
Canvassers and make a <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> on the basis of the
result of said petition for recount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the filing of the
verified petition <span class="GramE">We</span> issued a temporary order
restraining respondent <span class="SpellE">Noor</span> from taking oath and/or
assuming office and from further exercising the duties and functions of the
office of Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the pleadings filed
by the parties and the documents thereto attached, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find the following to be the facts neces­sary for an adjudication of the issues
involved:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Macud</span></span><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Noor</span> were
candidates for the office of Mayor of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, in the elections held on November 14, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the elections the Board met to canvass
the results, but having failed to canvass the votes cast in Precincts 3 and 11,
it made no proclamation of the winners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering this as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of its order of
December 12, 1967 directing the members of the Board to canvass the results and
proclaim the </span><span style="">winning </span><span style="">candidates,
COMELEC, on December 26, 1967, suspended the members of the Board, substituted
them with lawyers employed in its law department, and ordered this new Board to
complete the can­vassing of the election returns and thereafter to proclaim the
winners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The new Board met for the
above purposes on December 28 and 29 in the Manila office of COMELEC pursuant
to another resolution of the latter of December 21, 1967 changing the venue of
the canvassing in view of the tense conditions pre­vailing in the Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the session of the Board on December 28, 1967, the question arose
as to which copy of the election returns submitted to it corresponding to
Precinct 3 should be used in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hearing the parties through their representatives so the minutes
of the session show - the Board ruled that the copy of the election returns for
COMELEC should be used because the other copy submitted to it appeared to have
been tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Board met again
the following day (De­cember 29), a similar question arose as to which of the
sets of election returns for Precinct 11 submitted to it should be used. Again
the Board decided to use the election returns of said precinct bearing Serial
No. 42721 prepared by the Board of Inspectors under the supervision of Atty.
Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Alagar</span>, representative of COMELEC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As
a result of the completed canvass, respondent <span class="SpellE">Noor</span>
was proclaimed as Municipal Mayor elect of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span> on December 29, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date he took his oath of office,
and assumed office on January 1, </span><span style="">1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a fact, however, that
on December 30, 1967 <span class="SpellE">Macud</span> filed a motion with
COMELEC for the annulment of the procla­mation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Noor</span> made the previous day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the </span><span style="">hearing </span><span style="">held in connection
therewith on January 2, 1968, Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, as <span class="SpellE">Macud's</span> counsel, asked for a clarification of the COMELEC
resolution of December 27, 1967 mentioned here­tofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection therewith COMELEC issued
another reso­lution on that date reiterating "its resolution of December
27, 1967 suspending proclamation of winning candidates for the period of ten
(10) days given in said resolution of De­cember 27, 1967, in connection with
the canvass and procla­mation for local offices in LUMBA BAYABAO, LANAO DEL
SUR, hereby setting aside during the said period of ten (10) days the effects
of any proclamation made, if any, provided that if within the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> period no judicial relief is ob­tained, then
the proclamation per canvass made shall stand".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not denied that <span class="SpellE">Macud</span> did not appeal from COMELEC resolutions of December
12 and 27, 1967 <span class="GramE">nor</span> from that of January 2, 1968.
However, after the issuance of the latter, or more specifically on January 4,
1968, he filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span>
City, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, a petition for </span><u><span style="">judicial recount</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and secured from said court a writ of preliminary
injunction restraining the Board from proclaiming the </span><span style="">winning </span><span style="">candidate for Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attempts to serve the writ on the Chairman of
the Board, Atty. Lydia <span class="SpellE">Querubin</span>, failed, so on
January 10, 1968, an undated letter of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mindalano</span>,
as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Macud</span>, - received by COMELEC on
January 6 of the same year - was submitted to said body for consideration, and,
acting upon the same, COMELEC issued on the same date a resolution, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads <span style="">as </span>follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the ‘appropriate judicial relief’ stated in
the resolution of this Commission dated January 2, 1968, contemplated a
judicial re­lief from the Supreme Court, the Commission, after hearing Atty. <span class="SpellE">M<span style="">a</span>ngorsi</span> <span class="SpellE">Mindalano</span>, RESOLVED to hold that the proclamation made by
the Municipal Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on December 29,
1967 shall stand."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Macud's</span></span><span style=""> motion for </span>reconsideration of this
last reso­lution was denied by COMELEC on January 18, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Macud</span>,
in­stead of appealing from the resolution referred to, filed the present triple
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to petitioner, the issue in this case is whether or not
the COMELEC has the power to order a canvas­sing board to refuse recognition of
a petition for judicial recount filed by an affected candidate pursuant <span style="">to a CCMELEC
resolution (AS INTERPRETED BY THEM) suspending the proclamation of the </span>winner,
to give opportunity to the aggrieved party to seek <u><span style="">appropriate judicial relief</span></u><span style="">, </span>upon the ground that such petition for judicial recount is not
the appropriate remedy but an appeal to the Supreme Court from <span style="">the previous </span>resolutions
of COMELEC of December 12, <span style="">December </span>27, 1967 and January 2, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondents contend that the true issue in
this case is whether COMELEC has jurisdiction to suspend the effects of a
proclamation after the party pro­claimed has already assumed office, and
whether or not the phrase "appropriate judicial relief" used in the <span style="">COMELEC </span>resolutions
meant a petition for judicial recount or an <span style="">appeal to the Supreme Court from the orders
complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have held heretofore that when a board of canvassers rejects
an election return on the ground that <span style="">it is spurious </span>or has been tampered with, the
aggrieved party may <span style="">elevate </span>the matter to the Commission on <span style="">Elections for appropriate relief (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. COMELEC, G. </span>R. No. <span class="GramE">L-28415,
January 29, 1968), and that, if the Commission sustains <span style="">the action of the Board </span>of Canvassers,
the aggrieved party may appeal from the corresponding resolution to the Supreme
Court.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts stated
heretofore show that <span class="SpellE">Macud</span> failed to appeal not only
from the resolutions of COMELEC of December 12 and 27, 1967 and of January 2,
1968, but also from the one issued on January 10, 1968, which sustained the
proclamation made by the Board on December 29, 1967 by allowing it <u><span style="">to stand</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Instead, he re­sorted
to the abovementioned petition for judicial recount which COMELEC did not
consider as the <u><span style="">appropriate judicial
relief</span></u><span style=""> </span>mentioned in
its aforesaid resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="1">January 2,
 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the facts appearing
of record, <span class="GramE">We</span> can not find that, in so doing, COMELEC
had acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning <span class="SpellE">Macud's</span> contention that
COMELEC should be ordered to take cognizance of - in other words, to respect
-the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in the petition for
judicial recount filed therewith, the least that We can say at this time is
that the enforceability of said writ against COMELEC is of doubtful legality,
considering the status and rank of the issuing Court in relation to that of
COMELEC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">HAVING ARRIVED AT THE
FOREGOING CONCLUSIONS</b><span style="">, We are </span>constrained
to hold that neither one of the writs prayed for <span style="">in </span>the verified petition under consideration is proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the petition for their issuance
<span style="">is hereby </span>denied, and the
restraining order issued heretofore is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
