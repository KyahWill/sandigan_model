				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">These are interrelated
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G. R. No. L-21705 is a </span>petition
for <i style="">certiorari</i>, with preliminary
injunction, to set aside an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, directing the execution of its decision
in Civil Case No. 2281 thereof, entitled "The Province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental vs. National Waterworks and Sewerage
Authority" - hereinafter referred to as NAWASA - during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal taken by the latter from said
decision, whereas G. R. No. L-24327 is the aforementioned appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said case No. 2281 was instituted by the Province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental - hereinafter referred to as the
Province - on July 13, 1960, to recover from the NAWASA the possession, ad­ministration,
operation and control of the <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Waterworks System
and the <span class="SpellE">Orquieta</span> Waterworks System - hereafter
referred to collectively as the Systems - which had been taken over by the
NAWASA since 1956, acting in pursuance of Republic Act No. 1383.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, said court - presided over by
Hon. Al­fredo <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>, Judge, one of the respondents
in L-21705 - rendered judgment, on April 30, 1963, declaring that the Pro­vince
is the absolute owner of said Systems and ordering the NAWASA to return the
same to the Province, to refund thereto the sum of P13,855.44 which the
Province had delivered to the NAWASA when it took over the Systems, to render -
within thirty (30) days from notice of said decision - an accounting of the
income realized by the Systems since April 1956, or, in defect of such
accounting, to pay to the Province the sum of P7,823.76 monthly, the average
monthly income of the two (2) Systems, from April, 1956, to the date of the
return thereof to the Province, as well as to pay thereto P50,000, as
temperate, punitive and exemplary damages, and P5,000 by way of attorney's
fees, in addition to the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1963</st1:date>,
copy of the decision was sent by regis­tered mail to counsel for the <span style="">NAWASA, </span>in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 8, the Province filed a motion, which
was set for hearing on May 25, for the execution of said decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this motion was received, on May 13,
by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">NAWASA's</span></span><span style=""> </span>counsel, who, on May 14, prepared an
opposition thereto upon the ground that he had not, as yet, received copy of
the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Invoking the same ground,
the <span style="">NAWASA </span>requested by telegram,
on May 24, the postponement of said hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On May 25, Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> denied said request,
overruled <span class="SpellE"><span style="">NAWASA's</span></span><span style=""> </span>objection to the mo­tion for
execution and granted the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2)
days later, the clerk of court issued the corresponding writ of execution,
which was complied with on May 28, 1963, insofar only as the possession,
administration, operation and control of the Sys­tems, which were turned over
to the Province, not as to the money judgment in its favor, which remained
unsatisfied for <span style="">lack of funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the NAWASA offices in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, the NAWASA filed an urgent motion, dated <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1963</st1:date>, for "permission to
post <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond to stay execution pending
appeal".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, likewise, filed a
supple­ment to said motion, dated June 30, 1963, stating that the or­der of
execution was not supported by good grounds and that the damages that might
arise from the delay in the execution of the decision "can be fully
compensated".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1963</st1:date>, the lower court, then
presided over by Hon. Arturo B. Santos - Judge <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>
being then on leave - den­ied said urgent motion, after receiving <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span> evidence in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1963</st1:date>, the clerk of court issued another writ of
execution addressed to the City Sheriff of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="8">August
 16, 1963</st1:date>, the NAWASA filed the petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> in G. R. No. L-21705, predicated upon the theory that
the lower court had abused its discretion in ordering the execution of its
decision pending appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and in denying the
urgent motion to stay the execution upon the filing of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this contention, the
<span style="">NAWASA </span>insists that the order of
execution was prematurely issued on May 27, 1963, because the NAWASA had not as
yet received copy of the aforementioned decision, because there was allegedly
no valid and sufficient reasons to order said execution, and because the NAWASA
claims to be entitled to stay the execution upon the posting of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no merit in this
pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, there is no
legal provision barring execution of </span>a <span style="">decision, which is not yet final, before notice thereof has been served
upon the judg­ment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
copy of the decision of the lower court had, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, been sent, by registered mail, in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ozamis</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, addressed to <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span>
counsel in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the ordina­ry course of events, he should have received said copy long before </span><st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="5"><span style="">May 25,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the
motion for execution was heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
this motion was filed on May </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">and copy thereof was receive by said counsel,
in Manila, five (5) days later, or on May 13, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span>
representative in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental had, prior to </span><st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="5"><span style="">May 25,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, advised the
NAWASA, by telegram, of the aforementioned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said representative was present, in
the courtroom, when the motion for execution was heard on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="5"><span style="">May 25,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then too, <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span>
written opposition to the motion for execution was prepared </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="5"><span style="">May 14, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the NAWASA had had an opportunity to object to said motion and
did, in fact, object thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, this Court has repeatedly held, in several decisions the
first of which was rendered as early as August 30, 1959,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that Republic Act No. 1383 - upon the authority of which the NAWASA had acted
in taking over the Systems in question - is unconstitutional - insofar <span style="">as </span>it makes the NAWASA the owner of
all local waterworks systems <span style="">in </span>the
Philippines - upon the ground that it constitutes a taking of <span style="">private </span>pro­perty without just
compensation and without due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, although the execution of a decision <span style="">pending </span>appeal may be suspended upon
the filing of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond, the judgment debtor
is not entitled to suspension as a matter of right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court is merely <span style="">empowered </span>to order it <u>in </u><u><span style="">the exercise of its sound judgment or discretion</span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Consider</span>ing
that the <span style="">unconstitutionality </span>of
the aforementioned feature of Republic Act No. 1383 is now settled, and that
the appeal from the decision of the lower court - insofar as the owner<span style="">ship, possession, administration </span>and
control of the Systems in question - can not possibly prosper and can merely
have, therefore, a dilatory effect, the <span style="">lower
court was </span>obviously justified in refusing to suspend the <span style="">execution </span>of its decision, despite <span class="SpellE">NAWASA's</span> offer of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>regards the
appeal taken by the NAWASA, it is even more patent, in view of the
aforementioned decisions of this Court that, as regards the title, possession,
administration and control of the Systems, and the obligation to refund the
funds seized from the treasury of said Systems when the NAWASA took over the
same, and to account for the earnings thereof, said appeal has no leg to stand
on.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court was not justified, however, in awarding P50,000 <span style="">as </span>exemplary and temperate damages,
and P5,000, as attorney's fees, for the NAWASA took over the Systems in com­pliance
with said Republic Act No. 1383, which it was entitled to assume to be
constitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it had
acted in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ prayed for in G. R. No. L-21705 is
denied, and the complaint therein dismissed, with costs against the NAWASA,
and, with the elimination of said award for exemplary and temperate damages and
attorney's fees, the decision appealed from in G. R. No. L-24327, is hereby
affirmed, in all other respects, without special pronouncement <span style="">as </span>to costs in this instance.</p>
