the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> rendered on <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts to the controversy may be set forth as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner herein filed, on February 25, 1970, a Complaint in the
City Court of <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Branch II, for the recovery of damages on account of a vehicular accident
involving his automobile and a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hilot</span> and operated by <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>,
the last three being the private respondents in this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent thereto, a criminal case was filed
against the driver, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hilot</span>, arising from the
same accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the pre-trial in the
civil case, counsel for private respondents moved to suspend the civil action
pending the final determination of the criminal suit, invoking Rule 111,
section 3 (b) of the Rules of Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"(b) After a criminal action has been commenced, no civil
action arising from the same offense can be prosecuted, and the same shall be
suspended, in whatever stage it may be found, until final judgment in the
criminal proceeding has been rendered;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> in an Order dated <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1970</st1:date>, ordered the
suspension of the civil case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration thereof, having been denied on <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1970</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner elevated the matter on Certiorari to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, respondent Judge presiding, on <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1970</st1:date>, alleging that the City Judge
had acted with grave abuse of discretion in suspending the civil action for
being contrary to law and jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 5, 1970, respondent Judge dismissed the Petition for Certiorari
on the ground that there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
City Court in suspending the civil action inasmuch as damage to property is not
one of the instances when an independent civil action is proper; that
petitioner has another plain, speedy, and adequate remedy under the law, which
is to submit his claim for damages in the criminal case; that the resolution of
the City Court is interlocutory and, therefore, Certiorari is improper; and
that the Petition is defective inasmuch as what petitioner actually desires is
a Writ of Mandamus (Annex "R").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's Motion for Recon­sideration was denied by respondent Judge
in an Order dated <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1970</st1:date>
(Annex "S" and Annex "U").</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition for Review before this Tribunal, to which we
gave due course on <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1971</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner makes these:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT, RESPONDENT JUDGE MATEO <span class="SpellE">CANONOY</span>, ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE TRIAL OF THE CIVIL CASE
NO. 189 FILED IN THE CITY COURT OF <span class="SpellE">MANDAUE</span> SHOULD BE
SUSPENDED UNTIL AFTER A FINAL JUDGMENT IS RENDERED IN THE CRIMINAL CASE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THAT THE COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT IN ORDER

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">all of which can be synthesized into one
decisive issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not there can
be an independent civil action for damage to property during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the Complaint filed by petitioner before the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, it is evident that the
nature and character of his action was <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delictual</u></span>,
predicated principally on articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code, which
provide:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 2176.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whoever by
act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence is
obliged to pay for the damage done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between
the parties, is called a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> and is governed
by the provisions of this Chapter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1902a)".</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 2180.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or
omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>" xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their
employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned
tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>" xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease
when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of
a good father of a family to prevent damage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1903a)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, plaintiff made the essential
averments that it was the fault or negligence of the driver, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hilot</span>, in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
owned by the <span class="SpellE">Pepitos</span> which caused the collision
between his automobile and said <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>; that damages
were sustained by petitioner because of the collision; that there was a direct
causal connection between the damages he suffered and the fault and negligence
of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in the Answer, private respondents contended, among
others, that defendant, <span class="SpellE">Valeriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>,
observed due diligence in the selection and supervision of her employees,
particularly of her co-defendant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hilot</span>, a
defense peculiar to actions based on <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Liability being predicated on <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span>,
the civil case may proceed as a separate and independent civil action, as
specifically provided for in Article 2177 of the Civil Code.</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 2177.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Responsibility for fault or negligence under the preceding article is
entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence
under the Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the plaintiff
cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the defendant.
(n)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crucial distinction between criminal negli­gence and <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span>, which is readily discernible from the foregoing
<span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision, has been expounded in <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> vs. Garcia, et al., 73 Phil. 607, 620-621,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Firstly, the Revised Penal Code in article 365 punishes not
only reckless but also simple imprudence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If we were to hold that articles 1902 to 1910 of the Civil Code refer
only to fault or negligence not punished by law, according to the literal
import of article 1093 of the Civil Code, the legal institution of <u>culpa</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>aquiliana</u></span> would have very little scope and
application in actual life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death or
injury to persons <u>and damage to property</u> through any degree of negligence
- even the slightest would have to be indemnified only through the principle of
civil liability arising from crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such a state of affairs, what sphere would remain for quasi-<span class="SpellE">delito</span>
or culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>? We are loath to impute to the lawmaker
any intention to bring about a situation so absurd and anomalous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor are we, in the interpretation of the
laws, disposed to uphold the letter that <span class="SpellE">killeth</span>
rather than the spirit that <span class="SpellE">giveth</span> life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will not use the literal meaning of the
law to smother and render almost lifeless a principle of such ancient origin
and such full-grown development as <u>culpa</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>aquiliana</u></span>
or <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delito</u></span>, which is conserved and
made enduring in articles 1902 to 1910 of the Spanish Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Secondly, to find the accused guilty in a criminal case,
proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is required, while in a civil case,
preponderance of evidence is sufficient to make the defendant pay in
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are numerous cases of
criminal negligence which cannot be shown beyond reasonable doubt, but can be
proved by a preponderance of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such cases, the defendant can and should be made responsible in a
civil action under articles 1902 to 1910 of the Civil Code, otherwise, there
would be many instances of <span class="SpellE">unvindicated</span> civil
wrongs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ubi</span>
jus <span class="SpellE">ibi</span> <span class="SpellE">remedium</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thirdly, to hold that there is only one way to make
defendants liability effective, and that is, to sue the driver and exhaust his
(the latter's) property first, would be tantamount to compelling the plaintiff
to follow a devious and cumbersome method of obtaining a relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, there is such a remedy under our laws,
but there is also a more expeditious way, which is based on the primary and
direct responsibility of the defendant under article 1903 of the Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our view of the law is more likely
to facilitate remedy for civil wrongs because the procedure indicated by the
defendant is wasteful and productive of delay, it being a matter of common
knowledge that professional drivers of taxis and similar public conveyances
usually do not have sufficient means with which to pay damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why, then, should the plaintiff be required
in all cases to go through this roundabout, unnecessary, and probably useless procedure?
In <span class="SpellE">contruing</span> the laws, courts have endeavored to
shorten and facilitate the pathways of right and justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, it should be said that the primary and
direct responsibility of employers and their presumed negligence are principles
calculated to protect society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Workmen
and employees should be carefully chosen and supervised in order to avoid
injury to the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the masters
or employers who principally reap the profits resulting from the services of
these servants and employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is but
right that they should guarantee the latter's careful conduct for the personnel
and <span class="SpellE">partimonial</span> safety of others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Theilhard</span> has
said, 'they should reproach themselves, at least, some for their weakness,
others for their poor selection and all for their negligence.' And according to
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
'It is much more equitable and just that such responsibility should fail upon
the principal or director who could have chosen a careful and prudent employee,
and not upon the such employee because of his confidence in the principal or
director'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Vol. 12, p. 622, 2nd Ed.)
Many jurists also base this primary responsibility of the employer on the
principle of representation of the principal by the agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Oyuelos</span> says
in the work already cited (Vol. 7, p. 747) that before third persons the
employer and employee '<span class="SpellE">vienen</span> a ser <span class="SpellE">como</span> <span class="SpellE">una</span> <span class="SpellE">sola</span>
<span class="SpellE">personalidad</span>, <span class="SpellE">por</span> <span class="SpellE">refundicion</span> de la del <span class="SpellE">dependiente</span>
en la de <span class="SpellE">quien</span> la <span class="SpellE">emplea</span> y <span class="SpellE">utiliza</span>' (become as one personality by the merging of the
person of the employee in that of him who employs and utilizes him.) All these
observations acquire a peculiar force and significance when it comes to motor
accidents, and there is need of stressing and accentuating the responsibility
of owners of motor vehicles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fourthly, because of the broad sweep of the provisions of
both the Penal Code and the Civil Code on this subject, which has given rise to
overlapping or concurrence of spheres already discussed, and for lack of
understanding of the character and efficacy of the action for culpa-<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>, there has grown up a common practice to seek
damages only by virtue of the Civil responsibility arising from crime,
forgetting that there is another remedy, which is by invoking articles 1902-1910
of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although this habitual
method is allowed by our laws, it has nevertheless rendered practically useless
and nugatory the more expeditious and effective remedy based on culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span> or culpa extra-contractual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, we are asked to help
perpetuate this usual course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we
believe it is high time we pointed out to the harm done by such practice and to
restore the principle of responsibility for fault or negligence under articles
1902 et seq. of the Civil Code to its full rigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is high time we cause the stream of quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> or culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span> to flow
on its own natural channel, so that its waters may no longer be diverted into
that of a crime under the Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This will, it is believed, make for the better safeguarding of private
rights because it reestablishes an ancient and additional remedy, and for the
further reason that an independent civil action, not depending on the issues,
limitations and results of a criminal prosecution, and entirely directed by the
party wronged or his counsel, is more likely to secure adequate and efficacious
redress." (Garcia vs. <span class="SpellE">Florido</span>, 52 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 420, 424-425, Aug. 31, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The separate and independent civil action for a <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span> is also clearly recognized in section 2, Rule
111 of the Rules of Court, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Independent</u>
<u>civil</u> <u>action</u>. - In the cases provided for in Articles 31, 32, 33,
34 and 2177 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
an independent civil action entirely separate and distinct from the criminal
action, may be brought by the injured party during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the criminal case, provided the right is reserved as required in the
preceding section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such civil action
shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, and shall require only
a preponderance of evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Significant to note is the fact that the
foregoing section categorically lists cases provided for in <u>Article</u> <u>2177</u>
of the Civil Code, <u>supra</u>, as allowing of an "independent civil
action".</p>

<p class="BODY">Tested by the hereinabove-quoted legal tenets, it has to be held
that the City Court, in suspending the civil action, erred in placing reliance
on section 3 (b) of Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, <u>supra</u>, which refers
to "other civil actions arising from cases not included in the section
just cited" (i.e., Section 2, Rule 111 above quoted), in which case
"once the criminal action has being commenced, no civil action arising
from the same offense can be prosecuted and the same shall be suspended in
whatever stage it may be found, until final judgment in the criminal proceeding
has been rendered".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated
otherwise, the civil action referred to in <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 3(a)
and 3(b) of Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, which should be suspended after the
criminal action has been instituted is that arising from the criminal offense and
not the civil action based on <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 31 of the Civil Code then clearly assumes relevance when
it provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
civil action is based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission
complained of as a felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the
criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">For obviously, the <span class="SpellE">jural</span>
concept of a <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span> is that of an
independent source of obligation "not arising from the act or omission
complained of as a felony".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
1157 of the Civil Code bolsters this conclusion when it specifically recognizes
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1157.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obligations
arise from:</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><u>Quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delicts</u></span>.
(1089a)" (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It bears emphasizing that petitioner's cause of action is based
on <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The concept of <u>quasi</u>-<u>­<span class="SpellE">delict</span></u>, as enunciated in Article 2176 of the Civil Code
(<u>supra</u>), is so broad that it includes not only injuries to persons but
also damage to property.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It makes no distinction between "damage to persons" on the one hand
and "damage to property" on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the word "damage" is used
in two concepts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the "harm"
done and "reparation" for the harm done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with respect to "harm" it is
plain that it includes both injuries to person and property since
"harm" is not limited to personal but also to property injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, examples of <u>quasi</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>delict</u></span> in the law itself in­clude damage to
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An instance is Article 2191(2)
of the Civil Code which holds proprietors responsible for damages caused by
excessive smoke which may be harmful "to persons <u>or</u> <u>property</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing disquisition, we are constrained to
