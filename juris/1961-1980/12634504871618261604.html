				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Since <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1954</st1:date>,
Jorge <span class="SpellE">Magalona</span> worked for NASSCO-<span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
Steel Mills, as <span class="SpellE">batteryman</span>, then as
electrician-helper and finally as pulpit operator with a weekly sa­lary of
P26.40, with hours of work at <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 A.M.</st1:time>-<st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">Noon</st1:time>,
<st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 P.M.-4:00 P.M.</st1:time> As a <span class="SpellE">batteryman</span>, he filled jars of dry cells with hydrochloric
acid inside a room that was always damp because of the sprinkling of water over
the dry cells to prevent the acid from flowing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As electrician-helper, he helped clean electric motors, rewound coils
and did other work in the electric shop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his last designation as pulpit operator, he worked in the rolling
mill department, which was hot, operated an elec­tric switch and caught steel
bars passing through at a finish line.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1956</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Magalona</span> went on sick leave, to last up to <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not able to report for work after his
leave expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1956</st1:date>, he was admitted in <st1:place><st1:placename>Riverside</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he died on May 17, of that year, of duodenal ulcer with partial obstruction
at the pyloric end of the stomach, severe anemia with kidney complications.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1956</st1:date>,
his widow, Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Magalona</span>, filed a claim for
compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company did not controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing officer of the
Regional Office, Department of Labor, awarded the widow and her child P2,745.60
as death benefits, P200.00 as burial expenses, P1,645.60 as medical expenses
and P135.28 as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award
was based on the ground that the conditions of work - inhalation of gas fumes,
incessant heat, irregular eating habits - might have caused duodenal ulcer, in
line with the principle of liberal construction of labor laws in favor of the
laborer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On review before the Workmen's Compensation Commission in Manila,
claimant's counsel filed a "Motion to Dismiss the Appeal or Reply to
Petition for Review", alleging, as it did before the hearing officer, that
the case should be dismissed because NASSCO had not filed any written notice of
<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since medical considerations were involved,
Workmen's Compensation Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span> Perez
referred the case to the Evaluation Division of the Bureau of Workmen's
Compensation for a medical opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Elda</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, Senior
Compensation Rating Medical Officer therein, in her report dated February 20,
1963 (approved by the Chief of the Evaluation Division), stated that although
the exact cause of duodenal ulcer is still unknown, the conditions of his work,
in the absence of sufficient proof that the deceased missed or had irregular
meals, had no causal relationship with the ailment causing his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without resolving the motion to dismiss,
Commissioner Perez reversed the decision of the hearing officer, absolved
NASSCO and ruled that duodenal ulcer is not compensable without any showing
that there was any causal connection between the ulcer and the nature of the
work, such as aggravation of the illness through an accident, overexertion and
the like.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> denied her motion for
reconsideration, claimant appealed to Us by way of certiorari, raising the
following questions for determination:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Could the NASSCO have legally petitioned for review of the
decision of the hearing officer considering that it had not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
the claim?</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Was the admission by Commissioner Perez of the medical opinion
of a Senior Compensation Rating Officer of the Commission proper?</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Was there need for claimant to show causal connection between
the death of the employee and the nature of his work?</p>

<p class="BODY">As the hearing officer found, NASSCO failed to controvert the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span class="SpellE">NASSCO's</span>
position that granting there was no <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
the acceptance by the hearing officer of <span class="SpellE">NASSCO's</span>
evidence was tantamount to reinstatement of its right to controvert, citing
Section 4 of Rule 14 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, to reinstate one's
right to controvert, the section requires a petition under oath by the
employer, specifying the reason for its failure to controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, there was no such
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere acceptance by the hearing
officer of the evidence presented did not mean the reinstatement of the right
to controvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law itself provides
that only the Commissioner may reinstate the right to controvert (<u>See</u>
Sec. 45, par. 2, Workmen's Compensation Act; Agustin v. WCC, L-19957, Sept. 29,
1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By failing to present a written <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim, the employer, NASSCO, renounced
its right to challenge the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this means that all non-jurisdictional defenses, such as non-compensability of
the illness, prescription, etc., are barred.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent NASSCO, in its answer before Us, alleges that the
claim had prescribed, for it allegedly received notice of the claim for
compensation only on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1964</st1:date>
(p. 64 of the Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing
officer, however, found that the records show the claim to have been received
on <st1:date year="1956" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1956</st1:date> (Record,
p. 33).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it was the com­pany
physician who diagnosed the employee's illness (pp. 73 of <span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,
quoted in petition, p. 22 of Record).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The wife testified under oath that she sent a telegram to NASSCO right
after the death of her husband and later filed her claim with its manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These matters were not touched on by the
reviewing commissioner or the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and should
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow's acts after the death
her hus­band may be considered as substantial compliance with the required
notice of claim for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
case, We accepted as substantial compliance with Section 24 of the Act an oral
demand for compensation hardly a month after lay-off, making of little
consequence a subsequent written claim filed much later.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And besides, as stated, for lack of proper <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
the defense of prescription is likewise barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the admissibility of the medical opinion-report of
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, said report should not have been
admitted because while technical rules of procedure need not be followed by the
Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
no evidence should be taken into account where the adverse party was not given
the opportunity to object to its admissibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This is sound, especially where on such admitted report was principally based
the decision of reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the medical report, the Workmen's Compensation
Commissioner ruled that the claimant must first establish a causal link between
the nature of the employment and the cause of death of <span class="SpellE">Magalona</span>,
before claimant can be compensated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is a reversible error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employee had
obviously been sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His inability to
report back to work when his sick leave expired dick not sever the
employer-employee relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NASSCO
never claimed that it had terminated his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NASSCO claimed that he was "absent
without leave" (pp. 36-38 of <span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., quoted in
respondent's answer, pp. 68-69 of the Record).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is now unquestionable that once the illness supervened at the time of
the employment there is a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption that
such illness arose out of the employment or was at least aggravated by such
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant is relieved
from the burden of proving causation once the illness or the injury is shown to
have arisen in the course of employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> Thus, the precise medical cause of
the illness is not legally significant, as long as the illness supervened in
the course of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
presumption of causation or aggravation then applies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The function of a presumption is precisely to
dispense with the need for proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
burden to overthrow the presumption and to disconnect, by substantial evidence,
the injury or sickness from employment, is laid by the statute at the door of
the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
In the case at bar no substantial evidence exists to over­come said
presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, even if the medical
report is considered, since the report itself admits that the real cause of
duodenal ulcer is unknown, the presumption established by law would still apply
as against a mere opinion on the non-causal connection between duodenal ulcer
and the nature of <span class="SpellE">Magalona's</span> employment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed resolution of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and the Commissioner's decision
are hereby reversed, and the award of the hearing officer granting claimant
P2,745.60 as death benefits; P200.00 as burial expenses; P1,645.60 as medical
expenses; and P138.25 as attorney's fees, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
