				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XXI, in Election Case No. 15464 entitled "<i>Jose M. Lontoc, protestant-counter protestee vs. Teodoro D. Rodriguez, protestee-counter protestant</i>", wherein the Hon. Gregorio G. Pineda, District Judge of Rizal of said Branch XXI, ruled that protestee Rodriguez won over protestant Lontoc by a plurality of 110 votes (3,842 votes counted for protestee and 3,732 votes counted for protestant); dismissed the protest with costs and expenses against protestant; confirmed the proclamation of protestee as duly elected mayor of Montalban, Rizal, in the election of November 8, 1971; and ordered the protestant to pay the protestee the sum of P10,000.00 as attorney's fees.<br><br>Uncontested facts are:&nbsp; that petitioner Jose M. Lontoc was an independent Nacionalista Party candidate for the office of the Mayor of Montalban, Rizal, against private respondent Teodoro Rodriguez, the official candidate of the Nacionalista Party for the same office in the general elections of November 8, 1971; that the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Montalban, Rizal, proclaimed private respondent Rodriquez as elected mayor of that town, crediting him with a total of 3,831 votes against 3,742 votes credited to petitioner Lontoc; that petitioner Lontoc filed an election protest with the Court of First Instance of Rizal contesting the election of private respondent Rodriguez and impugning the election returns from all precincts of Montalban, Rizal, and claiming from the private respondent P100,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as attorney's fee; that private respondent Rodriguez in his answer with special defenses and counter protest, contested the election in Precincts Nos. 1-A, 1-M, 2, 3-H, 3-M, 4, 5-M, 12-A, 12-­M, 16-A, 16-M, 17-A, 17-M, 18-A and 18-M (15 precincts), prayed also for moral exemplary damages plus an attorney's fee of P20,000.00; that a petition for annulment of canvass and proclamation of mayor-elect in Montalban, Rizal, filed by petitioner Lontoc (Commission on Elections Case No. C-171) was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by Commissioners Jaime N. Ferrer, Lino M. Patajo and Jose M. Mendoza in Resolution No. RR-1050, dated November 29, 1971; that petitioner and private respondent presented their respective documentary evidence and their objections to the ballots during the trial of the case, wherein private respondent Teodoro Rodriguez also presented as witness Mr. Maximo Bernardo, Acting Chief of the Electro Typing &amp; Foundry Division of the Bureau of Printing, who testified on the genuineness of a number of ballots cast for respondent Rodriguez which were questioned by petitioner Lontoc as allegedly spurious and unofficial; and that after trial the respondent District Judge rendered a decision as stated in the preceding paragraph.<br><br>The conclusions embodied in the dispositive part of respondent judge's decision were based on the following:<br><br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; The original protest of petitioner Jose M. Lontoc impugned the elections returns from all the 35 precincts of Montalban, Rizal, on the grounds of alleged "rampant fraud and terrorism committed by armed goons and policemen of protestee Rodriguez who was then the incumbent mayor of Montalban, Rizal, for the purpose of coercing voters to vote for protestee"; that "votes for other candidates were read and counted for protestee while several valid votes for protestant were not credited to the latter", and "that spurious ballots filled with the name of protestee were dropped into the ballot box and thereafter counted in favor of protestee";<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Protestee Rodriguez contested the election in fifteen (15) precincts (Precincts Nos. 1-A, 1-M, 2, 3-A, 3­-M, 4, 5-M, 12-A, 12-M, 16-A, 16-M, 17-A, 17-M, 18-A and 18-M), impugning the election in said precincts on the allegation that it was the protestant Lontoc "who committed, participated, tolerated and/or consented to the commission of acts violative of the provisions of the Election Code of 1971";<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; That protestee Rodriguez subsequently withdrew his "counter protest on precincts 12-M, 12-A, 16-M, 16-­A, 17-M, 17-A, 18-M and 18-A" as protestant Lontoc earlier withdrew "his protest in the aforementioned precincts";<br><br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; At the trial, protestant Lontoc offered his objections to several ballots in the contested precincts, after which protestee Rodriguez also made his objections to several ballots in the counter protested precincts.&nbsp; Thereafter both parties submitted their memoranda simultaneously and the case was submitted for decision on August 8, 1972;<br><br>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp; In all other precincts where election returns were not disputed, protestant Lontoc garnered 1,081 votes while protestee Rodriguez obtained 621 votes;<br><br>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contested and counter-protested precincts, the election returns of which were disputed by both protestant and protestee, there were uncontested ballots as well as ballots the objections to which were withdrawn in the course of the trial involving the twenty-seven (27) precincts in question;<br><br>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the reports submitted by the two sets of revisors appointed by the lower court to recount and examine the disputed ballots, the respondent court proceeded to pass upon the validity of the contested ballots of protestee Rodriguez, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 1</i> — Exhibit PIA-A — This ballot is not marked because the bracket placed after the name "Salvador Roberto" who was then a candidate for councilor, was an indication that the voter desisted from voting for other candidates for councilor after voting for "Salvador Roberto";<br><br>Exhibits PIA-1 and PIA-2 not marked, because the words "Big Boy" written between "M." and "San Juan" on the space for vice mayor is the registered nickname of candidate "Moises San Juan" for vice mayor;<br><br>Exhibits PIA-3 to PIA-10 (7 ballots) not written by one and the same person per respondent court's observation because the manner of handwriting on them differ from one another and in the absence of evidence <i><i>aliunde</i></i> they should be considered valid;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. IA </i>— Exhibit PIA-A — not marked, because two long dashes with a circle in the middle placed after the name "Felix" on the eight space for councilors meant desistance of voter to vote further and there is no evidence of voter's intention to mark his ballot;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-B — not marked, even if the voter wrote "Nic" opposite the name of candidate "Valdez" for councilor, since that is the nickname of the candidate;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-C — not marked, because the voter appears to have a poor handwriting and unschooled, notwithstanding that the names of two senatorial candidates "Salonga" and "John Osmena" were written in a different manner from that of the names of other candidates;<br><br>Exhibits PIA-D and PIA-D-1 — not written by only one person in the absence of evidence, such as a handwriting expert, to prove that they were so prepared;<br><br>Exhibits PIA-E, PIA-E-1, PIA-E-2 — not written by one person in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i>;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-H — not marked, just because nickname "Ente" enclosed in parenthesis was written by voter after the family name "Rodriguez" on the space for mayor, since "Ente" is the registered nickname of protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-I — not a stray vote, because what was written on the space for mayor is "E. Rodriguez", the "E" being the initial of protestee Rodriguez's nickname "Ente";<br><br>Exhibit PIA-J — not marked, by the mere fact that voter did not fill the spaces for senator and left the first space for councilor since desistance of a voter to vote for other candidates will not invalidate the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-K — not marked, just because "Concha San Juan" were written on two spaces, one for vice mayor and the other on the space for councilor since the name of the candidate written on the correct space should be counted, the word "Ode" written on the 6th space for senators standing for "Ople", a senatorial candidate, and there is no evidence that the voter intended to mark the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-L — not marked, since there is no evidence that voter intended his vote to be identified;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-M — not marked because no evidence of voter's intention to identify his ballot, as what appears therein is an innocent error;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-N — not marked, the Court observing that the figure "2" said to be written on the 5th space for senator before "Garcia" is "I", standing for "Inday" and not "2";<br><br>Exhibit PIA-O — not marked, just because the voter wrote the names of five candidates for senators in five spaces for senators, crossed them out and rewrote the names of the senatorial candidates voted for;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-P — not written by more than one person in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i>;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-Q — not marked nor a stray ballot, due to voter's supposedly writing "S.D. Rodriguez" for mayor, the court having found the alleged letter "S" to be "T", representing the initial of Teodoro Rodriquez;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-R — not marked, even if the initial "R" was written after "Mitra", "Salvador Jr.", "Nicolas", the court observing that initial "R" are the correct initials of each of said candidates;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-T — not marked, because erasures and wrong spelling of names of candidates voted for were merely innocent errors of the voter;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-U — not marked, by the mere fact that "E. Rodriguez" was written on the space for mayor and only the family name of candidates for councilors were written;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-V — not marked, just because spaces for senators, provincial governor, provincial vice governor, members of the municipal board and councilors were left blank;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-X — not marked, just because voter chose to vote for only "Teodoro Rodriquez" as mayor and nobody else;<br><br>Exhibit PIA-Z — not a marked and stray ballot because the word "Isidoro" is not an identifying mark and is "<i>idem sonans</i>" for "Teodoro", the first name of protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precinct No. 2 — Exhibit P2-A — not a stray vote, for "Isidoro" is "<i>idem sonans</i>" for "Teodoro", first name of the protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>Exhibit P2-B — not valid for protestee, since "Nita" is not "<i>idem sonans</i>" for "Ente" or "Teodoro";<br><br>Exhibit P2-C — valid for protestee Rodriquez since "E" is the initial of "Ente", registered nickname of protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. P3A</i> — Exhibit P3A-A — marked ballot because the impertinent expression, "Apollo 13", was written on ballot to distinguish it;<br><br>Exhibit P3A-B — not marked, although voter placed "Ben Castro" candidate for vice mayor on 1st space for councilor, as that is not an identifying mark but will result in a stray vote for candidate "Ben Castro";<br><br>Exhibit P3A-C — not marked because the voter did not intend to identify his ballot but merely corrected his mistake by writing the whole name of "Isidro I. Rodriguez" for governor;<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precinct No. 3 — Exhibit P 3-A — not marked, by the mere writing of figure "1" by the voter and nothing written on the other spaces, the court ruling that circles, crosses or lines put on the spaces left blank by voter in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i> will not invalidate the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P3-B — not marked, just because voter voted twice for "Primicias" a candidate for senator and crossed out "Tambunting" from the space for governor, upon realizing his mistake and wrote "Tambunting" on the space for provincial board member;<br><br>Exhibit P3-E — not marked, just because spaces for senators, provincial governor, provincial board members and councilors were left blank, in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i>;<br><br>Exhibit P3-N — not marked nor stray vote, as "E" is the initial of the nickname "Ente" of protestee;<br><br>Exhibit P3-S — not marked, by the mere fact that the last letter "o" of "Teodoro" was written with heavy lines and letters were made in big bold block letters, with the names of two senatorial candidates in printed letters, the court observing that the voter could hardly write;<br><br>Exhibit P3-CC — not marked, the supposed initial, "F", preceding "Rodriguez" being "T' which is the correct initial of protestee Rodriguez, the court observing that the voter could hardly write;<br><br>Exhibit P3-HH — not marked, just because voter changed his style of writing in placing the names of candidates he voted for;<br><br>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 4</i> — Exhibit P4-A — not marked, because "Isidoro R. Rodriquez" is "<i>idem sonans</i>" for "Teodoro R. Rodriguez";<br><br>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 5</i> — Exhibit P5-A — not marked, by the mere fact that voter placed the name of "Diokno" who was not a candidate for senator, that being a mistake and not intended to identify the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P5-G — not marked nor written by two persons per Court observation that the style, inclination of strokes, pressure, spacing and general characteristics of writing are substantially the same although written by one with poor handwriting;<br><br>Exhibit P5-H — marked ballot, for having impertinent and irrelevant writing, "<i>Kuha sebu</i>", intended to identify; not counted for protestee;<br><br>Exhibit P5-K — not marked nor written by more than one person because leaving of blank spaces in the ballot is not intended to identify it; and the writing appearing on the ballot must have been done by one hand;<br><br>Exhibit P5-L — not marked, although "Jose Lontoc" written on 3rd space for members of the provincial board and with wrong spelling of candidate's names, with the Court observing the poor handwriting of voter;<br><br>Exhibit P5-M — not marked, as blank spaces left in the ballot cannot be considered as identifying marks;<br><br>Exhibit P5-N — not marked even though "Teodoro Rodriguez" appeared written on the space for mayor and on the first space for councilor, erased and the name of "R. Salvador", a candidate for councilor, written above with blank spaces, since there is no evidence that the voter intended his vote to be identified;<br><br>Exhibit P5-O — not marked, even if the name "Roxas", not a candidate, was written on the 5th space for senator;<br><br>Exhibit P5-P — not marked, just because "Gregorio Sandoval" was written on the 5th space for councilor and there is no evidence that "Gregorio Sandoval" was not a candidate for councilor;<br><br>Exhibit P5-Q — not marked.&nbsp; The mere fact "Isidro Rodriguez" was written on the 1st space for members of the provincial board, "Ente Rodriguez" on the space for mayor, "Teodoro Rodriguez" on the space for vice mayor, does not make the ballot "marked" in the absence of evidence that voter intended to identify his ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P5-R — not marked, although with erasures and some of the names of candidates mis-spelled as there is no evidence that voter intended to identify ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P5-U — not marked per court observation that there is no indentation or separation of the name "Garcia" from figure "5";<br><br>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 5A</i> — Exhibit 5A-A — not marked, although the letter "D" and "R" in "Rodriguez" were capitalized since the use of two or more styles of writing will not invalidate the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P5A-B — not a stray vote because "E" Rodriguez stands for "Ente Rodriguez", the nickname of protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>Exhibit P5A-C — not a stray vote because "E. Rodriguez" was written on the space for mayor, following the preceding reasoning;<br><br>Exhibits P5A-D, P5A-E, P5A-F — each of them not written by more than one person per court observation of the handwritings appearing therein;<br><br>Exhibit P5A-G — void, because printed names "T. Felix" and "A. San Diego" were posted on the blank spaces for councilors in violation of Sec. 189, par. 16 of the Revised Election Code;<br><br>Exhibit P5A-H — not marked, just because "Big Boy" on the space for vice mayor was written between the name "Moises San Juan", said "Big Boy" being the registered nickname of candidate Moises San Juan;<br><br>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 6</i> — Exhibit P6A — not marked, just because "Ente Rodriguez" was written on the space for provincial governor and valid vote for protestee Rodriguez as it was also written on space for mayor, in accordance with Sec. 189, par. 5 of the Revised Election Code;<br><br>Exhibit P6-C — marked ballot because of the irrelevant, insulting and indecent expressions "Idok", "nonoy", "Meding Satanas" writen by voter to identify his ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P6-H — not a stray vote because "E. Rodriguez" refers to protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 6A </i>— Exhibit P6A-A — not marked, just because "Gregorio Salvador" was written five times on the ballot, in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i> to prove voter's intention to identify ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-B — not marked, by the mere fact that voter changed his mind in the senatorial candidates voted for pursuant to Sec. 189, par. 5 of the Revised Election Code;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-C — not marked, just because names of non-candidates "Roxas" and "Aquino" were written in the space for senators (Sec. 189, par. 15 Revised Election Code);<br><br>Exhibits P6A-D and P6A-E — not marked, just because names of non-candidates "Roxas" and "Garcia" were included among candidates for senators;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-F — not a stray vote because "E" Rodriguez is the initial of "Ente", registered nickname of protestee Rodriguez;<br><br>Exhibits P6A-G and P6A-H — not marked, just because names of non-candidates appear on the ballot;<br><br>Exhibits P6A-I and P6A-J — not marked, although initials "F" and "I" supposedly written by voters before the surname "Rodriguez" (construed by the Court as "T" attributing the supposed "F' and "I" to the poor handwriting of the voters), and valid for protestee Rodriguez in accordance with Sec. 189, par. 8 of the Revised Election Code;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-K — not marked, just because blank spaces were left on the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-V — not marked, just because voter committed a mistake in writing the names of candidates on wrong spaces and subsequently corrected his mistake (Sec. 189, par. 6 Revised Election Code);<br><br>Exhibit P6A-Q — not marked, just because "Rodriguez" was written twice on the space for governor and vice governor without any evidence that the voter intended to identify his ballot (Sec. 189, par. 5 of the Revised Election Code);<br><br>Exhibit P6A-R — not marked, just because "Almendras" was written twice on the space for senators (Sec. 189, par. 5 of the Revised Election Code;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-U — not marked, just because "I.

Rodriguez" was written on the 1st space for members of the provincial board (stray vote for Isidro Rodriquez) and "D. Rodriguez" (Doro Rodriguez) on the space for mayor, the Court considering the vote "D. Rodriguez" valid for protestee Rodriguez, because "D." can stand for "Doro" the last two syllables of "Teodoro", and there is no other candidate for mayor in Montalban with the surname Rodriquez in that election;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-W-5 — not marked, although the name "I. Rodriquez" written on the 1st space for members of the provincial board makes it a stray vote;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-W-44 — not marked, although blank spaces were left on the ballot in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i>;<br><br>Exhibit P6A-W-47 — not marked, just because "Roxas" was written on the space for senators, because names of conspicuous politicians or personages do not constitute identifying mark (Juliano vs. Callos, G.R.

Rodriguez" was written on space for mayor (Sec. 189, par. 8, Revised Election Code);<br><br>Exhibit P7A-T — not marked, just because "Gerry Roxas" written on top portion of ballot on space not intended for candidate's names (Sec. 189, par. 20, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Precinct No. 7</i> — Exhibit P7-A — marked, because of printed sticker "Cano Santos" pasted on the 4th space for councilors in the ballot;<br><br>Exhibit P7-C — not marked, just because "M.

Exhibit P9-9, not a stray vote for mayor, because "Lankac" is <i>idem sonans</i> to "Lontok";<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibits P4-12, P6A-39, P6A-59, P6A-62, P6A-67, P6A-68, P6A-70, P6A-71, P6A-77, P6A-78, P6A-2, P7-37, P7-34, P7-33, P7­-32, P7-23, P7-22, P7-16, P7-15, P7-14, P7-13, P7-12, P7-11, P7-4, P7-64, P7-63, P7-58, P7-37, P7-56, P7-55, P7-53, P7-50, P7-49, P7-44, P7A-27, P7A-28, P7A-29, P7A-31, P7A-34, P7A-37, P7A-41, P8A-­31, P8A-14, P8A-17, P8A-18, P8A-33, P8A-24, P8A-11, P8A-10, P8A-A, P9-2-M, P9-45, P9-25, P9-26, P9-29, P10-16, P-13-34, P13-18, P13-10, P13-4, P14-15, P14-14, P14-12, P14-11, P14-10, P14-9, P15-7, P15A-49, P19-A-E, P19-8-D, P19-8-C, P19-A-B, P19-8-A, and P19-8, are not marked because alleged thumbprints on face and/or back of ballots were only accidental flourishes not intended by the voter to identify the ballot (Sec. 189, par. 20, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P1-1-5, not marked, because "Torpes" really was "Torres", one of the candidates for councilor;<br><br>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P8-3, marked, because "Undung Inutil" on space for provincial board member was impertinent, insulting and the voter meant his ballot to be identified;<br><br>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P9-44, not marked because figure "272" appearing at back of ballot in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i> cannot be considered voter's intent to identify ballot;<br><br>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P11-8, marked, because initials "DKT" written on right side of ballot was intended to identify it;<br><br>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P4-7, marked, because voter signed his initials on the 6th and 7th lines for councilors showing a clear intention to identify ballot;<br><br>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P7A-16, marked, because "Salvador" written at the bottom of ballot was meant to identify it;<br><br>(12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibits P6-2 and P6A-37, marked, because names of senatorial candidates were written properly on space for senators and then rewritten upside down on the space for councilors, clearly to identify the ballot;<br><br>(13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P19-38, marked, because name "Zuñiga" was written upside down to identify ballot;<br><br>(14)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P14A-15, marked, because "Ayos Lang" (Just right) written after name of protestant was impertinent and irrelevant expression meant to identify ballot;<br><br>(15)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P19A-18, marked, because "Change the administration" written on the space for provincial board member are irrelevant expressions intended to identify ballot;<br><br>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ballots claimed by the protestee, to wit:&nbsp; Exhibits P3A-30, P4-1-A, P5A-22, P6A-90, P8A-70, P8A-71, P8A-36, P9A-45, P16A-36, P11A-38, P11A-39, P19A-39 and P1A-6 on the ground that said ballots were not counted in favor of protestee, although "Isidro Rodriguez" appear on the space for mayor, the Court rules that "Isidro Rodriguez" is <i>idem sonans</i> as "Teodoro Rodriguez", protestee, and that the claimed ballots must be counted in his favor (Sec. 189, par. 4, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P3A-29, should be counted for protestee because "Rodriguez" appears on the space for mayor although it was poorly written, there being no other person by that name who was candidate for mayor of Montalban, Rizal in the elections of 1971;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P6A-89, should be counted for protestee because "E. Rodriguez" stands for "Ente Rodriquez" protestee's registered nick name;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P8-69, should be counted for protestee because "Ente R" undoubtedly refers to protestee (Sec. 189, par. 11, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P8-72, should be counted for protestee because "Rodris" on space for mayor is <i>idem sonans</i> to "Rodriguez" or its abbreviation;<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P8A-37, should be counted for protestee even if detachable coupon was not removed from ballot (Sec. 189, par. 22, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P10-A-37, should be counted for protestee because "Peodoro Rodaris" is <i>idem sonans</i> to "Teodoro Rodriguez", protestee;<br><br>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P10-38, should be counted for protestee because "J.M. Rodriguez" is clearly a vote for protestee even if there is an error in the initials of the given name (Sec. 189, par. 8, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P10-A-30, should be counted for protestee because "Rodres" is <i>idem sonans</i> to "Rodriguez" and the voter's intention to vote for protestee cannot be doubted;<br><br>(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P15-41, should be counted for protestee although "Teodoro R" was written slightly below the line for mayor, it was outside of the space for other officers and the initials "B." "C." following "Teodoro R.", can be for candidate "Ben Castro", as vice mayor.&nbsp; There is no doubt that "Teodoro R" refers to protestee (Sec. 189, par. 8, Revised Election Code);<br><br>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit P19-43, should be counted for protestee because although "E. Rodriguez" (Enteng Rodriguez) was written on the space for vice-mayor, the voter clearly indicated by arrows starting from "E. Rodriguez" pointing to the space for mayor that he intended to vote for protestee for the position of mayor;<br><br>(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summation, the Court declared twelve (12) votes counted in favor of protestee but contested by protestant to be invalid, thus deducting said 12 votes from the total number of votes counted in favor of protestee which is 3,831, or a balance of 3,819 votes for protestee.&nbsp; This Court noticed that the lower Court held invalid the following votes for protestee, to wit:&nbsp; (1) Exhibit P2-B (stray vote); (2) Exhibit P3A-A (marked ballot); (3) Exhibit P5-H (marked ballot); (4) Exhibit P5A-G (marked ballot); (5) Exhibit P6-C (marked ballot); (6) Exhibit P7A-L (marked ballot); (7) Exhibit 7A-R (marked ballot); (8) Exhibit P7-A (marked ballot); (9) Exhibit P8-C (marked ballot); (10) Exhibit P8-D (marked ballot); (11) Exhibit P8A-P-4 (marked ballot); (12) Exhibit P 14A-P (stray vote); (13) Exhibit P19A-N (marked ballot), numbering 13 votes, not 12 as per lower court's decision.&nbsp; To this 13 invalid votes for protestee, We rule that two more votes, Exhibits P13-C and P13-D must be added, because these two ballots should be considered marked ballots, following the lower court's ruling in Exhibits P8-C and P7A-16, thus resulting in a total of fifteen (15) votes invalidated for protestee, thereby leaving a balance of <i>3,816</i> votes for protestee Rodriguez after deducting fifteen votes from protestee's total of 3,831 votes.</blockquote></blockquote><br>On ballots claimed by protestee Rodriguez, the lower court ruled that 22 ballots should be counted in his favor contained in Exhibits P3A-30, P4-1-A, P5A-22, P6A-90, P8A-70, P8A-71, P8A-36, P9A-45, P16A-36, P11A-38, P11A-39, P19A-39, P1A-6, P6A-89, P8-69, P8-72, P8A-­37, P10-A-37, P10-38, P10-A-30, P15-41, P19-43.&nbsp; These 22 ballots (not 23 as appearing in lower court's decision) should be added to protestee's 3,816 votes or a total of 3,838 votes for protestee (not 3,842 votes as appearing in lower court's decision);<br><br>On protestant's contested ballots, the lower court invalidated <i>nine</i> (9) votes, namely, Exhibits P8-3 (marked); P11-8 (marked), P4-7 (marked); P7A-16 (marked); P6-2 (marked); P6A-37 (marked); P19-38 (marked; P14A-15 (marked); and P19A-18 (marked); (not 10 votes as appearing in lower court's decision, because Exhibit P15-A-5 is not included among those invalidated); hence giving protestant a total of 3,733 votes, after deducting 9 invalidated votes from protestant's total of 3,742 votes (not a total of 3,732 votes as appearing in lower court's decision).&nbsp; The inevitable mathematical conclusion is that protestee's total of 3,838 votes to protestant's total of 3,733 votes, gives the former a plurality of <i>105</i> votes (not 110 votes as appearing in lower court's decision).<br><br><center>I</center><br><br>All the principal issues raised by petitioner are in connection with respondent court's alleged errors in the appreciation of ballots cast in the 1971 elections for the position of mayor of Montalban, Rizal, more specifically:&nbsp; (1) for crediting private respondent Rodriguez with votes wherein on the space for mayor in the ballots were written "Isidro Rodriguez", "Vicente Rodriguez" or "Ernesto R."; (2) for crediting private respondent Rodriguez with votes wherein on the space for mayor were written "E. Rodriguez", "I.Rodriguez", "D. Rodriguez", on the ground that "E" is the initial of "Ente", allegedly nickname of private respondent, "D" is the initial of "Doro" which is <i>idem sonans</i> to "Teodoro", that "Isidro" may be spelled "Esidro"; (3) refusing to declare as marked ballots where the name of a candidate was written two or more times; (4) refusing to declare as marked ballots those that contain big printed letters in writing names of candidates or written in big Gothic letters; (5) refusing to declare as marked ballots where words or names were written on a space of the ballot not intended for voting, where irrelevant letters or words are written, or where the name of a candidate is written twice or in different spaces of the ballot; (6) crediting in favor of private respondent votes in ballots where the name written on the space for mayor does not correspond to his christian name or surname; (7) refusing to declare as marked ballots where "Isidro Rodlriguez", "I. Rodriguez", "S. Rodriguez" or "Rodriguez" is written on the first space for member of the provincial board.<br><br>To Our mind, the issues raised by petitioner boil down to:&nbsp; (1) should the contested ballots be considered marked just because of unusual writings on its face without evidence <i>aliunde</i> that the voters who cast them intended that they be identified?; (2) in those votes cast for the petitioner or private respondent where initials, nicknames, or abbreviations of candidate's names are used, could the intention of the voter in voting for the candidate of his choice be reasonably inferred?; (3) in those ballots where different styles of handwriting appear, can they be presumed prepared by more than one person?; (4) in case of doubt on the validity of the ballot, must the doubt be resolved in favor of its validity or otherwise?<br><br>Inorder that the issues raised may be correctly answered based on the individual appreciation of each contested ballot, We firmly believe that the trial court must be given sufficient leeway in the exercise of discretion based on its observation provided its findings and conclusions can be amply supported by applicable rules on appreciation of the ballot found in the Revised Election Code of 1971 and pertinent jurisprudence.<br><br><center>II</center><br><br>A close scrutiny of the respondent court's findings and conclusions on each of the contested ballot casts for petitioner and private respondent reveals no error committed in its appreciation of each one of them, except in Exhibits P13-C and P13-D, which We declare as marked ballots so that the lower court could be consistent in its rulings when it declared Exhibits P8-C and P7A-16 marked ballots.<br><br>The lower court credited private respondent Rodriguez with votes wherein on the space for mayor were written "Isidro Rodriguez", "Vicente Rodriguez" or "Ernesto R.", basing its conclusion on Sec. 184, par. 4, of the Election Code of 1971 which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>"4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A name or surname incorrectly written which when read, has a sound similar to that name or surname of a candidate when correctly written shall be counted in his favor."<br><br>and disregarded Sec. 189, par. 25, of the same Election Code, which provides:<br><br>"25.&nbsp;&nbsp; If on the ballot is correctly written the name of a candidate but with a different surname, or is correctly written the surname of the candidate but with a different name, the vote shall not be counted in favor of any candidate having such name and/or surname but the ballot shall be considered valid for other candidates.",</blockquote><br>on the ground that the latter rule is qualified by the former rule on "<i>idem sonans</i>", a view We consider correct and justifiably applied by the lower court.&nbsp; Besides, We already ruled in this case of Corpuz vs. Ibay, 84 Phil. 184, 186, that "Isidoro" or "Isidro" are "<i>idem sonans</i>" to "Teodoro".&nbsp; As to "Vicente Rodriguez" there is very little doubt that "Vicente" is <i>idem sonans</i> to "Ente", registered nickname of private respondent in the certificate of candidacy (Exhibit "7").&nbsp; We are also convinced that those voters clearly intended to vote for private respondent Rodriguez as could be seen on the face of those contested ballots.<br><br>Regarding ballots with wrong initials of respondent Rodriguez (J.M. Rodriguez), the law (Sec. 189, par. 8, of the Election Code of 1971) succinctly provides that erroneous initial of the name and middle name of a candidate will not annul the vote in his favor.<br><br>"E. Rodriguez" appearing on the ballots' space for mayor were correctly credited for private respondent by the lower court because little doubt could exist that the voter intended to vote for respondent, "E." being the initial of "Ente", registered nickname of respondent which is now allowed to be used by candidates under Section 189, par. 11, of the Election Code of 1971.<br><br>The lower court, likewise, correctly credited votes for "D. Rodriguez" in favor of private respondent, for "Domingo" is his middle name and under Section 189, par. 8, of the Election Code of 1971, not even an erroneous intermediate initial between the correct name and surname of a candidate will annul the vote in his favor.<br><br>"I. Rodriguez" considered by the lower court "T. Rodriguez" appearing on the space for mayor, were correctly counted for private respondent, the "T." being the initial of "Teodoro" and even if the "T" is really an "I." the erroneous initial of the name which accompanies the correct surname will not annul the vote in favor of the candidate (Sec. 189, par. 8, Election Code of 1971).<br><br>We have no doubt on the well established rule that the mere repetition of names of candidates will not nullify the ballot on the ground that it is marked (voter intended it as a means to identify himself) in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i>.&nbsp; Section 189, par. 5, of the Election Code of 1971, provides:<br><br><blockquote>"When the name of a candidate appears in a space of the ballot for an office for which he is a candidate and in another space for which he is not a candidate, it shall be counted in his favor for the office of which he is a candidate and the vote for the office of which he is not a candidate shall be considered as stray, except when it is used as a means to identify the voter, in which case the whole ballot is invalid."</blockquote><br>In the case of <i>Juliano vs. Court of Appeals</i>, G.R. No. L­27477, July 28, 1967 (20 SCRA 808, 824), We stated that:<br><br><blockquote>"The writing of the name 'Juliano' twice in the space for mayor in this ballot would indicate only the enthusiasm of the voter in voting for Juliano.&nbsp; There is no evidence that the writing of the name Juliano twice in the space for Mayor in this ballot was deliberately done inorder to identify his ballot."</blockquote><br>The rule established in the foregoing case was first announced in the cases of <i>Amurao vs. Calangi</i>, L-12631, August 22, 1958, and <i>Gutierrez vs. Aquino</i>, G.R. No. L-14253, February 28, 1959, that:<br><br><blockquote>"So, too, when the name of a candidate is written twice in different spaces in each of 27 ballots, the vote for the office for which he is not a candidate should be considered only as a stray vote and <i>does not invalidate the whole ballot</i>, according to the express provision of Rules 3 and 13d Section 149. <i> To hold the repetition of the name of the candidate in the 27 ballots as intended for identification, evidence aliunde should be presented</i>." (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br>Ever mindful of the sanctity of the ballot and the presumption that the voter is innocent of wrongdoing, We prefer not to disturb in the slightest manner the foregoing rule.<br><br>Another well established rule that We find difficult to challenge for the same reason stated above, is that enunciated in Section 189, par. 20, of the Election Code of 1971, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>"Unless it should appear that they have been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks, ... <i>the use of two of more kinds of writing</i> and unintentional or accidental flourishes, or stains, shall not invalidate the ballot." (Italics supplied.)</blockquote><br>We already held a long time ago (<i>Ferrer vs. Alban</i>, 101 Philippine Reports 1018, G.R. No. L-12083, July 31, 1957) that the use of two or more kinds of writing cannot have the effect of invalidating the ballot unless it clearly appears that they had been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification mark.&nbsp; In the very much more recent case of <i>Juliano vs. Court of Appeals</i>, quoting <i>Taijanlangit vs. Cazenas</i>, G.R. No. L-18894, June 30, 1972, and <i>Silverio vs. Castro</i>, G.R. No. L-23827, Feb. 28, 1967, We stated:<br><br><blockquote>"In the absence of evidence, and the record does not show, that the writing of the name of Juliano and Uy in capital letters slightly bigger than the capital letters with which the names of the councilors were written was deliberately done to identify this ballot, this ballot cannot be considered marked."<br><br>"... The use of two or more kinds of writing on the ballot, in the absence of evidence that the voter had deliberately done this to identify his ballot, and the record does not show such evidence, does not invalidate the ballot".</blockquote><br>Section 189, pars. 19 and 20 of the Election Code of 1971, explicitly provides the following in an unequivocal manner:<br><br><blockquote>"Circles, crosses, or lines put on the spaces on which the voter has not voted shall be considered as signs to indicate his desistance from voting and shall not invalidate the ballot".<br><br>"Unless it should clearly appear that they have been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks, commas, dots, lines, or hyphens between the name and surname of a candidate, or in other parts of the ballots, traces of the letters "t", "J", and other similar ones, . . . shall not invalidate the ballot".</blockquote><br>We still firmly maintain that crosses, lines and other marks on a ballot will not automatically necessarily invalidate said ballot unless evidence <i>aliunde</i> is presented to prove that the voter deliberately marked the ballot to identify it and the voter.<br><br>We also sustain the lower court in its affirming and applying the general rule that a vote for a non-candidate, or candidates voted for wrong position will not mean that the ballot is marked unless evidence <i>aliunde</i> shows the voter's intention to identify the ballot and himself.&nbsp; Sec. 189, par. 15, of the Election Code of 1971, clearly provides:<br><br><blockquote>"15.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any vote in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or in favor of a candidate for any office for which he did not present himself shall be void and counted as a stray vote, <i>but shall not invalidate the whole ballot</i>." (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br>The clarity of the foregoing provision needs no further jurisprudence to elucidate on or explain its correct meaning.&nbsp; The mere fact that some of the non-candidates whose names were written on the ballots are conspicuous politicians or personages will not invalidate them in the absence of evidence that said names were used to identify the ballot and the voter.<br><br>The lower court did not commit any mistake in declaring a vote (Exhibit P8-V) valid for protestee Rodriguez although his name was written on the space for mayor as "Teodoro Apulid Rodriguez", because "Apulid" is nothing more than a <i>descriptio personae</i>, and there is no evidence <i>aliunde</i> showing the voter's intention to use the word "Apulid" to identify himself or the ballot.<br><br>We also sustain the lower court's rulings that letters "E" and "L" written or a ballot (Exhibit P9-Z), do not necessarily constitute identifying marks (Sec. 189, par. 20, Revised Election Code); that arrowheads written at the bottom of the ballot merely meant that voter was ending his ballot; that "Rodris" is <i>idem sonans</i> with "Rodriguez"; that what appears on Exhibit P10-A, is really "Mayor T. Rodriguez" and not "Moises T. Racob"; that "Rodress" written on Exhibit P10A-30 is <i>idem sonans</i> with "Rodriguez"; that what appears on Exhibit P11-J is really "T. Rodriguez" and not "P. Rodriluz"; that what appears on Exhibit P11-M as "Rodrizeras" or "Rodriges" is <i>idem sonans</i> with "Rodriguez"; that a ballot with detachable coupon not detached is valid (Sec. 189, par. 22, Revised Election Code); that ballot with "Teodoro R." written slightly below the line for mayor but not on a space for another office is valid for private respondent Rodriguez because the voter intended to vote for him and Section 189, par. 1 of the Election Code of 1971, provides:&nbsp; "Where only the christian names of a candidate . . . is written, the vote for such candidate is valid, if there is no other candidate with the same name or surname for the same office"; that ballot (Exhibit P7A­16) for petitioner where name of voter appears is invalid because of his clear intention to identify it; that ballot (Exhibit P4-7) signed with his initials by voter is marked and void; that ballots (Exhibits P6-2 and P6A-37) are invalid as marked ballots because the names of senatorial candidates were written upside down to identify ballots; that ballot Exhibit P19-38) was marked because "Zuniga" was written upside down to identify it; that completely torn ballots (Exhibits P3A-F and P3A-G) where "spoiled" is written at the back of each cannot be counted in favor of petitioner Lontoc; that repetition of names of senatorial candidates on ballot (Exh. P9-FF) does not make it a marked ballot in the absence of evidence <i>aliunde</i> that voter intended to identify his vote; that the mere fact that a voter voted for a candidate to the wrong office will not invalidate the ballot in the absence of evidence that said voter intended to identify his ballot and himself.<br><br>We sustain the ruling of the lower court in all the preceding issues without being un-mindful of the truism that to accede to protestant's contention of the invalidity of protestee's contested ballots would eventually result in nullifying contested votes for protestant placed in similar situations as those of protestee's contested ballots (about 270 votes), thus increasing the number of plurality votes for protestee.<br><br>It is Our considered observation that the respondent court invariably ruled correctly on the issues raised by both protestant and protestee, in its duty to arrive at a correct appreciation of the contested ballots, applying rules (Sec. 189, Rules for appreciation of ballots, of R.A. 6388, the Election Code of 1971) and pertinent jurisprudence, all designed to help courts of justice approximate and determine the voter's authentic intention as to the question of who were really the candidates voted for and whether or not said voter intended to violate the secrecy of the ballot by resorting to means to identify himself or the ballot.<br><br><br><center>III</center><br><br>There is no error committed by the respondent court in declaring that ballots for protestant (201 ballots) and those for protestee (141 ballots) without watermarks, are valid, genuine and official ballots in the 1971 elections, in the light of the testimony of two well qualified witnesses (Chairman of the Committee on printing for ballots Remigio Octavio and chief of the Electro Typing and Foundry Division of the Bureau of Printing Maximo Bernardo) that millions of ballots, some of them without the necessary security watermarks, were sent out for distribution to different provinces and cities.&nbsp; Neither did the lower court commit an error when it declared 74 ballots (those in exhibits enumerated from the bottom of page 124 to the top of page 125 of the respondent court's decision), for the protestant Lontoc, objected to by protestee Rodriguez as marked, valid and good votes for the protestant, because alleged thumbprints affixed on the face and/or back of said ballots "were only accidental flourishes and were not intended to be placed by the respective voters to identify the ballot" (Sec. 189, par. 20, Revised Election Code of 1971).<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, except as herein modified, respondent court's decision is affirmed, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><br><li>The election protest is dismissed, with costs and expenses of the protest against protestant Lontoc;<br><br></li><li>The proclamation of protestee Rodriguez as the duly elected mayor of Montalban, Rizal in the election of November 8, 1971, is affirmed, with a plurality of 105 instead of 110 votes;<br><br></li><li>The protestant is ordered to pay the protestee the sum of P10,000.00 as attorney's fees.</li></ol><br>So ordered."</blockquote><br>With costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Makalintal, C.J., Castro, Makasiar,</i> and <i>Martin, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Teehankee</i> and <i>Muñoz Palma, JJ.,</i> on leave.</div>
