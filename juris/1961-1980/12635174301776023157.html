</span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span>
was found guilty thereof by the trial court and sentenced to an indeter­minate
prison term ranging from ten (10) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to twenty (20)
years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as maximum, to indemnify the heirs
of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Jimenez, in the amount of
P6, 000 and to pay the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

The appellate court was of the view that the crime committed by defendant was
murder, qualified by treachery - without any circumstance, aggra­vating or
mitigating which would call for the imposition of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<u> </u>Accordingly, the case was certified
to this Court upon the provisions of Sections 17 and 31 of the Judiciary Act of
1948 and Section 3, Rule 50, of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1963</st1:date>
was the barrio fiesta of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mabatao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A political meeting was, on the night of September 22, being held at the

meters <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, he was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet found its mark "at the back
of his buttocks, two inches below the waistline," About <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time> on the same day, September

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned in the brief of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> funnel down to one single proposition:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has the People dis­charged its heavy burden
of proving the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this question, we addressed
ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purpose, we explored
the entire record.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The People's case was built mainly on the testimony of three
witnesses: <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Autor</span>,
Sergeant Roberto Laurie of the Philippine Constabulary and <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dacalos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Candido</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Autor</u></span>.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>He is the People's mainstay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is supposedly the only eyewitness to the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, his testimony
must have to be scrutinized with a sharp judicial eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The People's proof should be beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as we read the
transcript, that testimony appears to be sufficiently infected with grave
doubts which prevent us from accepting his word without reservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Autor</span> said that he
was a farmer, although the record shows that his occupation "is to extract
tooth", for which reason he played hide-and-seek with the police.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
According to <span class="SpellE">Autor</span>, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1963</st1:date>, he was passing water beside a
small road about twenty meters from the place where the political meeting was
being held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed to be just about
one fathom from and to the left of appellant <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span> when the latter with a pistol shot <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Jimenez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim at that time was about two fathoms from and with his back to his
aggressor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three formed a sort of a
triangle.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The
gist of <span class="SpellE">Autor's</span> direct examination was that he saw
the actual shooting and yet, there appears to be a contradiction of this
alleged fact when he was cross-examined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this point, his direct examination yields the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>While you were there on this occasion, was

he shot?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But, then, on cross-examination, <span class="SpellE">Autor</span>
declared:</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing inconsistency, placed in proper focus, sets <span class="SpellE">Autor's</span> testimony on infirm grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the incident, people went to the place where Jimenez
fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amongst them were Governor Ali <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, Vice-Governor <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span>, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Yap and
many others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Autor</span>,
however, testified that he com­municated to nobody, although "Mr. <span class="SpellE">Qulbranza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span> and his
leaders were still there,"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and left for home without even extending a helping hand to the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Autor</span> said that he
did not mention the incident to the people in his own house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances suggest a substantial
amount of impro­bability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of interest is <span class="SpellE">Autor's</span> declaration that
the only person to whom he ever mentioned what he saw was a brother of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, he did in the morning
following the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem
odd then that the brother of the victim did not inform the authorities about
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not so
indicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one appeared to have ever
thought at that time of taking <span class="SpellE">Autor's</span> statements,
certainly very important to this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, he was, as already stated, allegedly the sole eyewitness to the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well it is to remember that an
investigation was then being conducted by the Constabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and a number of witnesses were in
the barracks located in the same town of <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Added dubieties there are.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We note in the criminal com­plaint filed in the municipal court on <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1963</st1:date> - 10 days after the
crime - by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Golez</span>,
Commanding Officer of the PC, that the name of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Autor</span> was not mentioned as one of the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in the criminal in­formation the
Provincial Fiscal filed in the Court of First Instance on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1964</st1:date>, the name of this witness, <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Autor</span>, was conspicuous in
its absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, the evidence is
that <span class="SpellE">Autor</span> - the only eyewitness to the crime - was
in his home in nearby Barrio <span class="SpellE">Salong</span> as early as June,
1964.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Sergeant</u> <u>Roberto</u> <u>Laurie</u>, 73rd PC Company
stationed at <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
gist of his testimony is that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="9">September
 23, 1963</st1:date>, he was awakened by Lt. Mejia, Junior Officer of the unit,
who told him that there was shooting in <span class="SpellE">Mabatao</span>
during the rally and asked him to escort the victim to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw the victim, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Jimenez, at the gate of the guardhouse in a three-fourths truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With Jimenez were Governor <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, Vice-Governor <span class="SpellE">Qulbranza</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> Jimenez, Jose <span class="SpellE">Villarta</span>
and some PC soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He described in
court the dialogue between him and the victim, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Jimenez, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>You stated you met <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Jimenez with these persons you have mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What else did you do when you met <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Jimenez?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I get inside the truck I said, 'What's
happened?' he said, 'I was, shot.' I further asked him, 'Who shot you?' he
said, '<span class="SpellE">Anas­tacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I further asked him, 'Why did you see <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span> when it was
dark?' he replied that 'I clearly saw him.' I inquired from him as to whether
he will live with the wound he sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He replied that I will live.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
bring me to the hospital.'”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

however, his attention was drawn to his affidavit dated <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1963</st1:date> appearing on page 7 of the record
below and to a specific question and answer therein, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

statement you made in this affidavit wherein the question was asked in this
wise:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What question did you ask to
the victim?' and your answer is this,</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him who shot him and
he answered me that it was <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I asked another question, why did you

further asked another question, do you think you will not die of your wound you
received?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not answer any
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Lt. Mejia ordered the driver to
leave immediately for <st1:city><st1:place>Aurora</st1:place></st1:city> so
that the victim will be given imme­diate treatment of his wound.' Is that
correct?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The value of Laurie's testimony is, indeed, impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, because he did not hesitate - in Court
- to overshoot his mark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One wonders
whether he did so to make a weak case look good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, it does not strike us as natural that
given that opportunity, Sgt, Laurie, or any other constabulary officer for that
matter, did not put that statement of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Jimenez into writing, the better to preserve its worth as evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Written words speak a uniform language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oral recollection, in turn, could suffer from
the treachery of memory or from coloring.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>What else did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I further asked him, 'Are you certain that
it was really <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span>
who shot you?' and he replied that I clearly saw him because the light reached
the place where he was then."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This last statement would contradict the
affidavit of Sgt. Laurie who asked a question along similar lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Why did you recog­nize him when in fact
it is dark?" And, according to the affidavit of Sgt. Laurie heretofore
quoted, "the victim did not answer." This witness, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacalos</span>, a neighbor and
an old friend of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Jimenez, like the alleged
eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Autor</span>, <u>did</u>
<u>not</u> <u>figure</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>witnesses</u>
for the prosecution, either in the criminal complaint filed by PC Capt. <span class="SpellE">Golez</span> or in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
indictment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name was not amongst
those who gave affidavits to back up the criminal charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gives the impression that <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacalos</span>, the neighbor of
the deceased, was but an eleventh-hour witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To take his testimony on its face value, we fear, is to rate truth so
lightly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing evidence of the People leaves much to be
desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It exhibits a gap between
doubtful evidence and proof beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That gap is not bridged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence does not produce in an unprejudiced
mind that moral certainty so necessary to bring about conviction in a criminal
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this context that we find
ourselves unprepared to send appellant to jail for life, or, for that matter,
for a long term of imprison­ment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, we are not morally convinced.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. But if more were needed, circumstances there are which cast a
heavy pall of doubt on the sufficiency of the People's evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 o'clock</st1:time> that morning of September 23, appellant herein was placed
under arrest in his own home, He was brought to the PC barracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of that day, he was released
by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Golez</span> who told him: "We cannot detain
you here because there was no com­plaint filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, you should report to this headquarters everyday."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
If really this man were pinpointed by the deceased - at about 2:00 a.m. of
September 23 - as the author of the grave crime of murder - it must be borne in
mind that the affidavits were executed not on the 23rd of September but on
October 3, 1963 - it does not seem probable that the peace officers would
release him so soon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is' then
probability that the reason why he was arrested was because he was merely a
suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But without evidence against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this could have sprung from the
fact that as barrio captain, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Jimenez lodged a complaint for theft of large cattle against a son of appellant
by the name of <span class="SpellE">Bitoy</span>, amongst others.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And then, two of the defense witnesses' namely, <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Maghinay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paciencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacaling</span> were,
likewise, investigated by the Constabulary on that same <u>morning of</u> <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="9"><u>September</u> <u>23,</u> <u>1963</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record suggests that the
testimony of these 'two witnesses were taken in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record below at least does not show any
such written statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And these two
witnesses with another by the name of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lomolho</span> sup­ported the alibi offered as a defense by
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts are significant because, as aforesaid, the
affidavits of the People's witnesses were only taken on <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1963</st1:date>, even as the peace officers had
prompt know­ledge of the crime and allegedly learned of facts which linked
appellant to the crime as early as about two hours after the perpetration
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as aforesaid, the criminal
com­plaint was lodged in the municipal court only on that day, October 3.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. There is a dearth of <span class="SpellE">autoptic</span> or
demonstrative evidence which would positively connect appellant with the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record shows that
the officers even made any effort to locate the alleged pistol used by
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less was it
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there evidence that
appellant has had one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of
<st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1963</st1:date>, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacalos</span>, in the presence
of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sarbida</span>, pointed at appellant as the owner of
a big hat which was apparently left at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant denied this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even that hat was not exhibited in
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, its whereabouts accounted
for.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, <span class="SpellE">Autor</span> testified that he (<span class="SpellE">Autor</span>) - who knew appellant very well - saw appellant at
the scene of the crime, recognized him because the light was bright and the
distance between the two was only about one fathom, asked him "What is
that?", whereupon appellant "ran away".<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
If all these were true, it does not seem probable that appellant would make
himself a sitting duck, go to and stay in his home in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Salong</span>, 'about one kilometer from the scene of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there to be arrested at about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sarbida</span> and a provincial policeman by the name of <span class="SpellE">Madid</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did he
run for?</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not unmindful of
the fact that appellant left his barrio on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="9">the 29th of September, 1963</st1:date>, that is, five days after <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Jimenez was shot, and went to live with his parents
and sisters in Lopez <span class="SpellE">Jaena</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
But he did so because he was warned daily by his neighbors that there were <span class="SpellE">Maranaos</span> hired by the brothers of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Jimenez to liquidate him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he really intended to hide from the
authorities, he would have done so at the first opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem to us that his flight was
induced by his instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The defense is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The version given is that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of September 22 after the cock­fighting
was over, appellant conducted a game of "<span class="SpellE">hantak</span>"
in the cockpit of <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span>, which was about five
kilometers from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That game of "<span class="SpellE">hantak</span>" lasted till
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> the following
morning of September 23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After which,
appellant went over to the house of <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Maghinay</span> where they took a drink for a few minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, appellant went home where he was
arrested as aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony in
this res­pect was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Maghinay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paciencio</span> Baca-ling and
<span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lomoiho</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be recalled at this point that
witnesses <span class="SpellE">Maghinay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bacaling</span>
were investigated at the Constabulary headquarters on that morning of <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, alibi is known to be the weakest of all defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to concoct, difficult to disprove.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, where the evidence for the prosecution is weak and betrays lack of
concreteness on the question of whether or not defendant is the author of the
crime charged, alibi as a defense assumes importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not very long ago, this Court, speaking
through Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Fraga</u></span>, L-12005, August 31, 1960, pointed out that
"[t]he rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to
change the burden of proof in criminal cases; otherwise, we will see the
absurdity of an accused being put in a more difficult position where the
prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than where it is strong."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the end, we have but to bear in mind that, by Consti­tution
and law, a defendant in a criminal case is entitled to an acquittal, unless his
guilt is shown beyond a reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
We cannot downgrade this precept by accepting less than what it exacts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Else, the protection afforded may be more in
sound than in substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The People's
evidence does not measure up to this standard - in this, a grave crime of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reason that guilt has not been established beyond
reasonable doubt, we vote to reverse the judgment under review, to acquit
defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span>
of the crime charged, and to set him at liberty.</p>
