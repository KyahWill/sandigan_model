by the Court of First Instance of Manila guilty as charged, and sentenced in

cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, the accused asks
for a verdict of acquittal in both cases on a plea of self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the evening of <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="11">November
 <span style="">26, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>, while Flora <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
was inside her beauty parlor at <st1:address><st1:street>2047 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>,
the accused, <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> de Leon, who lived a few meters
away on an <span style="">alley
at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">2053 </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Anacleto</span></span><span style=""> St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, came in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being only in </span><span style="">an undershirt (<span class="SpellE">sando</span>), he was requested by
Flora to leave the parlor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> resented this and started to create trouble by
pushing and kicking Flora's manicure table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, a
brother of Flora, arrived. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Upon learning
from his sister what was going on, Guillermo told <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>
to go home and not to make trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> refused to leave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This prompted Guillermo to hold him by the shoulder and push him out of
the parlor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving the premises,
<span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> told Flora and Guillermo to wait for him as
he would return.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to avert further trouble, Flora started to call up the
Manila Police Department by telephone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While she was doing so, her other brother, Simeon <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simeon was a friend of <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>; and upon being informed of the incident, he told
his sister that he would talk with <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Simeon then left the beauty parlor and proceeded towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was followed closely by Flora, Guillermo
and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, Simeon's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simeon had no sooner left the parlor than he
met <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>, who had just come from the alley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simeon asked <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>
why he was making trouble at the beauty parlor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> replied that he had no grudge against
Simeon, but that he was mad at Flora.</p>

<p class="BODY">After this point, the true sequence of events is not all too
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court below, giving full
credence to the testimony of Flora and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>,
states in its decision that "all of a sudden and without any warning to Simeon,
he took from his pocket the kitchen knife and stabbed Simeon on the
abdomen," and that "without warning, the accused also stabbed
Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> who approached with intention of
giving aid to his brother x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the appellant and his
witnesses were one in declaring that a boxing bout ensued between Simeon and
the appellant, started by Simeon; that Simeon drew his pistol, and the
appellant, to avoid being hit, tried to wrest the gun from Simeon; that the gun
fired without hitting the appellant who, remembering that he had in his pocket
implements for butchering pigs (consisting of 3 butcher knives, a small iron
bar and a whetstone), pulled out a knife and stabbed Simeon who fell and again
fired, missing for the second time; that Guillermo held the appellant by his
pants; that the appellant made a back swing with his knife, hitting Guillermo;
and that the appellant, now released from Guillermo's hold, ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Simeon and Guillermo were
taken to a hospital, where Simeon died the same evening due to shock and
hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guillermo was released from
the hospital after being confined for one month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot go along with
the appellant that self-defense has been proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that Simeon </span>was armed
with a pistol, it gas been established that he drew the same and fired two
shots only after he had been stabbed and the appellant had run away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming, therefore, that Simeon was
then boxing the appellant, the use of a knife by the latter may not be
considered as a reasonably necessary means for repelling the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same holds true in connection with the
attack against Guillermo, who was not even shown to have been armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other elements of self-defense, namely,
unlawful aggression on the part of the <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> brothers
and lack of sufficient provocation on the appellant's part, have, likewise, not
been established.</p>

<p class="BODY">In convicting the accused for murder and frustrated murder, the
trial court considered that the killing <span style="">of </span><span style="">Si</span>meon
and the wounding of Guillermo were qualified by evident premeditation and
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General,
however, is of the opinion that the said qualifying circumstances have not been
satisfactorily established, and, consequently, that the appellant should be
convicted only for homicide and frustrated homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court agrees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Flora <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> herself
testified that the appellant and the deceased met each other that evening only
some 7 or <span style="">8 </span>minutes after the
appellant had been forced out of the beauty parlor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stabbings occurred within 30 minutes
after the appellant's forcible <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances there was<span style=""> </span>no
sufficient time for meditation and reflection.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of treachery, there is, as already stated, great
variance between the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and those of the
defense witnesses, the former declaring that the appellant's attacks came all
of a sudden while the deceased and the appellant were talking with each other,
and the latter contending that the attacks came during a fistfight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is inclined to believe that the
stabbings were preceded by a fistfight between the appellant and the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why the appellant would
suddenly stab the deceased, as declared by Flora, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and Guillermo, is difficult to believe, not only because it is an admitted fact
that the two were good friends, but also because the deceased was not a party
to the verbal altercation between his sister and the appellant, or to the
appellant's forcible <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> from the beauty
parlor. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is, on the other hand,
reasonable to believe that the deceased, angered by the appellant's conduct in
the parlor as narrated to him by his sister Flora, boxed the appellant after a
brief exchange of words; and that the appellant, equally angered, exchanged
blows with the deceased, drew out his knife, stabbed the deceased, and,
immediately thereafter, likewise stabbed Guillermo, who stood nearby attempting
to help his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ratiocination
finds support in the medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2)
attesting to the presence of multiple abrasions on the appellant's body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Altogether, there is no convincing evidence
to support the conclusion that treachery attended the killing of Simeon <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and the wounding of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant should, accordingly, be held liable for homicide
and frustrated homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Homicide is punishable
with <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying
the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the appellant may, in the homicide case, be
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty the minimum of which should not be less
than <span style="">6 </span>years and 1 day nor more
than 12 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u>, and the
maximum of which should not be less than 12 years and 1 day nor more than 20
years of <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Th<span style="">e </span>indemnity to the heirs of the
deceased should be raised <span style="">to P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>,
<span style="">L-18793, </span>October 11, <span style="">1968).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>In the frustrated homicide case, the penalty should be lower by
one degree, or <span style="">6 </span>years and 1 day
to 12 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
appellant may be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty the minimum of which
should not <span style="">be </span>less than <span style="">6 </span>months and 1 day but not more than <span style="">6 </span>years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u>, and the maximum of which should not
be less than 6 <span style="">years
</span>and 1 day but not more than 12 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
mayor</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is hereby modified, and,
accordingly, the appellant is declared guilty of homicide in Criminal Case No.
