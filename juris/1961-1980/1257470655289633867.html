				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This &nbsp;case is before us on appeal from the Court of First Instance of Cagayan, &nbsp;which found appellant guilty of double murder and &nbsp;frustrated murder &nbsp;and &nbsp;sentenced her &nbsp;to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, with its accessory &nbsp;penalties; &nbsp;to indemnify the heirs of each &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;deceased &nbsp;Honorata Badajos and Erlinda Baturi in the amount of P6,000.00; and &nbsp;to pay the costs. &nbsp;In the brief for &nbsp;appellee, &nbsp;the Solicitor &nbsp; General recommends &nbsp;a verdict of acquittal. <p>Mrs. Aniceta Caronan was the owner and manager of a <i>sari-sari</i> &nbsp;store and <span style="font-style: italic;">panciteria </span>in the public &nbsp;market of Tuguegarao, Cagayan, and &nbsp;of a small rice mill across the street, a &nbsp;few meters from and &nbsp;on the same side as the house where she and her family were residing. &nbsp;In the market was &nbsp;another <span style="font-style: italic;">sari-sari</span> store operated &nbsp;by &nbsp;Mrs. Caronan's niece, &nbsp;Honorata Badajos, capitalized &nbsp;with money lent to her by her aunt Mrs. Caronan had several helpers: appellant, whose work was to launder for &nbsp;the family and look after the children; Cristina de la Cruz, &nbsp;the &nbsp;family cook; Valeriana Baturi, a salesgirl and Honorata's sister-in-law; Mariano Baturi, Honorata's husband, the rice mill machinists; and Gregorio Baquiran, a helper at the mill.</p> <p>The Baturis—Mariano, Honorata &nbsp;and &nbsp;their &nbsp;&nbsp;small daughter Erlinda— had their &nbsp;own house, but were allowed to use the kitchen in the residence of the Caronans. The testimony of Rosa Bacud, a niece of Honorata &nbsp;and a witness for &nbsp;the &nbsp;prosecution, &nbsp;is that &nbsp;on &nbsp;October &nbsp;23, &nbsp;1956, at about 11:00 o'clock in the &nbsp;morning, she was in that kitchen cooking rice and <i>pinakbet</i>, an &nbsp;Ilocano &nbsp;dish made up &nbsp;of an &nbsp;assortment &nbsp;of vegetables &nbsp;seasoned &nbsp;with "bagoong." &nbsp;With her at &nbsp; the time were Cristina de la Cruz and appellant. Rosa left the kitchen to get a can of "bagoong" from her employer's store across the street. &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon her &nbsp;return, she said, &nbsp;she saw &nbsp;appellant lift the cover &nbsp;of the pot in which the pinakbet &nbsp;was being cooked and put something inside. Appellant then replaced the cover and, together with &nbsp; Cristina, left &nbsp;the kitchen for one &nbsp;of the rooms of the house. When &nbsp;Rosa opened &nbsp;the &nbsp;pet &nbsp;to put in the "bagoong," she noticed some whitish substance, which she presumed to be salt, spread over &nbsp;the contents. &nbsp;As soon as the rice and &nbsp;the <i> pinakbet</i> were &nbsp;ready she took them to the store where she, &nbsp;Honorata and the latter's daughter Erlinda had their lunch. &nbsp;Immediately after the meal all three started vomiting violently. &nbsp;A &nbsp;little later Valeriana came and took them to the clinic of Dr. Remedios Reyes. </p> <p>Erlinda Baturi died at about 5:00 o'clock that afternoon, followed by Honorata at about &nbsp;9:00. &nbsp;Rosa &nbsp;Bacud survived.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>Post mortem</i> examination revealed that Honorata was two &nbsp;months in the family way and that she and her daughter had died of arsenic poisoning, a finding confirmed &nbsp;by the chemical analysis later made of portions of their intestines.</p> <p>Valeriana Baturi was also presented as a witness for the prosecution. &nbsp;Her job was that of &nbsp;salesgirl at the store &nbsp;of the Caronans. &nbsp;&nbsp;At eleven in the morning of the day of the incident, she said, she got her feet muddy and so went to wash them in the bathroom adjoining the kitchen of the Caronan residence. It was then that she saw appellant &nbsp;put something inside &nbsp;the &nbsp;pot containing the vegetable &nbsp;concoction. On this &nbsp;point, however, &nbsp;her &nbsp;testimony is &nbsp;far &nbsp;from &nbsp;clear. In one instance she &nbsp;said that "coming out from the <i>tienda</i>," &nbsp;she had "to go directly to the bathroom through the kitchen." &nbsp;&nbsp;She had &nbsp;just washed her feet and was entering the kitchen from the &nbsp; bathroom when she saw appellant as above &nbsp;related. &nbsp;In the very next breath she said she was already in the dining room, where she met Rosa Bacud carrying a can of "bagoong," when she turned her face and saw appellant putting something inside &nbsp;the &nbsp;pot of <i>pinakbet</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;And still later, she averred that she met Rosa Bacud in the sala of &nbsp;the house and that it was from there that, upon looking &nbsp;back, she saw appellant perform &nbsp;the act described.</p> <p>The case for the prosecution depends upon the weight that must be &nbsp;given to &nbsp;the &nbsp; testimony of these &nbsp;two witnesses—Rosa Bacud and Valeriana &nbsp;Baturi—and whether, assuming &nbsp;that they spoke the truth, &nbsp;the evidence proves appellant's guilt beyond reasonable &nbsp;doubt. <br>Rosa &nbsp;Bacud's testimony is suspect. &nbsp;She &nbsp;thought the whitish substance appellant had placed with &nbsp;the <span style="font-style: italic;">pinakbet</span> was salt. &nbsp;Yet she put in the "bagoong" anyway, without first testing the vegetables to &nbsp;find out &nbsp;if they were already salty enough. &nbsp; She did not even ask appellant what it was that she added, &nbsp;and &nbsp;why; &nbsp;or tell her &nbsp;employer, Mrs. Caronan, what appellant had done. &nbsp;Rosa Bacud was first investigated &nbsp;by Colonel Peñaflor of the Constabulary on &nbsp;the third &nbsp;day after the &nbsp;incident. &nbsp;The &nbsp;investigation was put down in writing. &nbsp;She did not say a word, however, &nbsp;about appellant's action. &nbsp;It was &nbsp;only &nbsp;in her subsequent &nbsp;affidavit, taken &nbsp;by &nbsp;Sergeant &nbsp;Jerez, &nbsp;that &nbsp;she mentioned &nbsp;the &nbsp;matter for the first time. </p> <p>Valeriana Baturi's apparently incriminating story fares no &nbsp;better under &nbsp;closer scrutiny. &nbsp;As &nbsp;already noted, she said she saw only once appellant's act of lifting the lid of the pot, but &nbsp;in her testimony mentioned three different places from which she saw it. &nbsp;And Aniceta &nbsp;Caronan, her own employer &nbsp;and aunt &nbsp;of the &nbsp;deceased &nbsp;Honorata Badajos, categorically contradicted Valeriana on several matters, including the incident of Valeriana's getting mud in her feet. &nbsp;But what is of material &nbsp;importance &nbsp;is Aniceta's emphatic affirmation &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;facts &nbsp;(1) that in her presence her husband, Arturo &nbsp;Caronan, &nbsp; asked Valeriana what had happened—when they all saw the poison victims vomiting—and Valeriana &nbsp;answered she did not know as she was in the <span style="font-style: italic;">tienda </span>all the &nbsp;time; &nbsp;(2) that appellant, questioned &nbsp;on &nbsp;the same occasion, &nbsp;gave &nbsp;the same reply, saying that she never left the place where &nbsp;she was washing clothes the whole morning; &nbsp;(3) &nbsp;that Valeriana did not give the lie to appellant then, which she should have done if she had indeed seen the latter tamper with the <span style="font-style: italic;">pinakbet </span>that &nbsp;was cooking; and (4) &nbsp;that there was no bathroom &nbsp; in the house adjoining and accessible &nbsp;from the kitchen. &nbsp;The only bathroom, according to Mrs. Caronan, was in &nbsp;the <span style="font-style: italic;">camarin </span>where the rice-mill was located, &nbsp;and the only way to go there &nbsp;from the <i>tienda</i> was across the street without &nbsp;passing through the kitchen of the house, because there was a tall bamboo fence separating the house from the <i>camarin</i>. Conversely, Mrs. Caronan said, to go to the kitchen &nbsp;from the bathroom &nbsp;one had to go out to the street and &nbsp;then turn back &nbsp;to the house on the other side of the fence. &nbsp;This last fact—about the bathroom— was confirmed &nbsp;by Arturo Caronan. &nbsp;He further testified that after &nbsp;the incident Colonel Peñaflor called &nbsp;him &nbsp;and his three maids for investigations, and Valeriana Baturi denied knowing anything because she was tending the store all &nbsp;the time. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was &nbsp;the &nbsp;same &nbsp;answer &nbsp;she gave &nbsp;him when he questioned &nbsp;her &nbsp;before &nbsp;the &nbsp;poison &nbsp;victims &nbsp;were taken to the clinic of Dr. Reyes, as well to the two physicians &nbsp;themselves in the clinic upon &nbsp;arrival there.</p> <p>Appellant &nbsp;denied the charge against her. &nbsp;She testified that she never left the bathroom near the rice-mill where she was washing clothes &nbsp;until she &nbsp;was called by her employer after the poisoning. &nbsp;The &nbsp;evidence shows no motive on her &nbsp;part to do away with the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;To &nbsp;be &nbsp;sure, Rosa Bacud made this statement: "My aunt Honorata Badajos suspected that &nbsp;Aurelia Mabborang is the paramour of Mariano &nbsp;Baturi &nbsp;(Honorata's husband)." &nbsp;This, &nbsp;however, besides being hearsay and opinion evidence, was belied &nbsp;not only by appellant but also by the fact that Mariano Baturi married another woman shortly after he was widowed, while appellant married Gregorio Baquiran, the helper at the rice mill.</p> <p>The conviction of appellant rests entirely on circumstantial &nbsp;evidence. &nbsp;The weakest link in &nbsp;the chain &nbsp;is at the same time the most &nbsp;vital, namely, the circumstance that the <i>pinakbet</i> was the agency which carried the &nbsp;poison. There is no satisfactory proof of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;What was left of the <i>pinakbet</i> (there must have been, &nbsp;if only a small portion) was not &nbsp;subjected &nbsp;to chemical analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;It could have been the culprit, of &nbsp;course, &nbsp;but &nbsp;the mere probability that it &nbsp;was &nbsp;does not satisfy the test of moral certainty which applies in criminal cases. &nbsp;The &nbsp;arsenic could conceivably have &nbsp; been &nbsp;mixed &nbsp;with the rice, &nbsp;or &nbsp;with the "ampalaya" &nbsp;and other vegetables &nbsp;before they were gathered, &nbsp;administered &nbsp;in the form of insecticide &nbsp;and deposited in their skin folds and ridges. This last probability was conceded &nbsp;by the NBI &nbsp;chemist &nbsp;who testified as an expert in this &nbsp;case.</p> <p>In the face of the evidence, we are convinced that the recommendation &nbsp;for acquittal &nbsp;made &nbsp;by the Solicitor General is justified.</p> <p>The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed and appellant is acquitted, with costs <i>de oficio</i>.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.
