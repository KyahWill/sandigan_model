				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 24, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija rendered 
decision in Civil Case No. 2438 ordering Geronimo T. Suva to pay Cecilio Corpuz, 
et al. the sum of P3,600.00 as damages and the costs of suit.
<p>Suva appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals where on December 11, 1959 
it was affirmed in all respects. Suva again tried to appeal the decision to the 
Supreme Court by way of certiorari, but the latter Court, in a resolution 
entered on March 18, 1960, dismissed the appeal "finding that the questions 
involved are factual and that there is no merit in the petition."</p>
<p>The decision having become final and executory, the case was remanded to the 
Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija for execution, and on September 10, 1960, 
upon motion of the winning litigants, said court issued the corresponding writ 
of execution.</p>
<p>On October 11, 1960, Suva filed before the same court of first instance a 
petition entitled "Petition to Enjoin Enforcement of the Decision of this 
Honorable Court dated January 24, 1958 in Civil Case No. 2488", praying that 
said decision be considered as having no force and effect and its execution be 
permanently enjoined on the grounds of (a) fraud, accident, mistake and 
excusable negligence; (b) newly discovered evidence; and (c) excessive damages 
had been awarded or the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision. He 
also prayed that, pending hearing on the merits, a writ of preliminary 
injunction be issued in order that the decision may not be immediately 
executed.</p>
<p>In view of the petition for the issuance of the writ of preliminary 
injunction, the court set the same for hearing on October 21, 1960, during which 
Suva's counsel presented documentary evidence in an effort to justify the 
issuance of the writ, but respondents' counsel manifested his opposition 
contending that the motion was untenable for the reason that the court has no 
jurisdiction over the case, the petition states no cause of action, and it is 
barred by a prior judgment. Thereupon, respondent's counsel moved to dismiss the 
petition.</p>
<p>Instead of ruling on the oral motion to dismiss, the court ordered 
respondents' counsel to put it in writing, and after the same had been filed, 
petitioner registered his opposition thereto. On December 5, 1960, the trial 
court issued an order denying the motion for the issuance of the writ, but 
granted the motion to dismiss, finding well-taken the grounds therein 
stated.</p>
<p>Petitioner took the present appeal directly to this Court purely on questions 
of law.</p>
<p>It appears that the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 2438 of the Court of 
First Instance of Nueva Ecija, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 
became final and executory when the petition for review, by way of certiorari, 
filed with the Supreme Court was dismissed on the ground that "the questions 
involved are factual and that there is no merit in the petition." And when the 
case was remanded to the court of origin for the execution of the judgment, 
petitioner commenced the present petition, before the same Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija for the purpose of enjoining the execution of the 
decision contending that said decision is invalid and of no force and effect. 
This cannot <i>now</i> be done considering that the decision has already become 
final and executory and has been rendered by a court of competent 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is true that the present petition is founded on the grounds of (a) fraud, 
accident, mistake or excusable negligence; (b) newly discovered evidence, and 
(c) excessive damages or insufficiency of evidence, but the same cannot be 
entertained at this instance because, as already stated, the decision which is 
sought to be set aside has long become final and executory. Under Section 1, 
Rule 37, or Section 1, Rule 55, of our Rules of Court, a new trial can only be 
sought either within 30 days after notice of judgment, or before entry of final 
judgment, and not when the judgment has become final and executory. And 
apparently, the petition filed by petitioner is in the nature of a new 
trial.</p>
<p>It may also be true that, as contended by the petitioner, the damages that 
were caused to the properties of respondents were not caused by his negligence 
in taking cart of his irrigation system but rather by the big volume of water 
that entered the irrigation canal caused by flood for which reason he cannot be 
held responsible for the resulting damages. But even if this fact be true, the 
same cannot be considered as newly discovered evidence to warrant the reopening 
of the case. This is a matter that could have been proven in the original case 
with the exercise of proper diligence which apparently has not been observed bv 
petitioner's counsel. At any rate, the decision in dispute can no longer be set 
aside being final and executory and having been rendered by a competent 
court.</p>
<p>In the circumstances, we find no error on the part of the court <i>a quo</i> 
in dismissing the petition even if in ite order the reasons supporting it had 
not been expressly stated. Its statement that it finds the petition not 
well-taken after due consideration of the motion to dismiss and the opposition 
interposed thereto is, in our opinion, a substantial compliance with the 
law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to 
costs.</p> <i>Padilla, Concepcion, Barrera, Paredes, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, 
JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Reyes, J. B. L., J.</i>, concurs in the result: no 
showing of extrinsic fraud.</div>
