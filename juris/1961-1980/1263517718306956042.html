and <span class="GramE">her</span> hus­band Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Meris</span>,
from a decision of the Court of First Instance of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> dismissing Civil Case No.
1766 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">Petitioners herein having filed <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span>
Sales Application </span><span style="">No</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">.</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;"> V-1603 for the purchase
of a parcel of public land, of about 619 square meters, situated in the City of
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and appraised at P5.40 per square meter, on
June 18, 1962, the Director of Lands caused to be published a notice to the
effect that said land would be sold by his office, through oral bidding, on
September 6, 1962, at 10:00 A.M., at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After describing the land in
question, the notice said:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"No bid shall be accepted that does not equal at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the appraised value of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order that a person may be entitled to
parti<span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">cipate in the bidding, he must, before
the commence</span>ment thereof, make a deposit of at least ten per centum
(10%) of his bid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person bidding in
representation of another may do so under a duly executed power of
attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the bidding the bidder
has to make an additional deposit every time his bid is raised to complete the
10% of his raised bid, otherwise such bid as raised shall not be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right is reserved to reject any or all
bids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only deposit in cash, money order,
certified check, cashier's check and manager's check can be accepted.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The successful bidder
if other than the owner </span>of the improvements must reimburse the latter of
the value thereof and must also deposit the sum of P340.00 to defray the
expenses for the publication of the notice of auction (P190.00) and the survey
of the land (P150.00)."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only petitioners herein and private respondent Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, both acting through their respective
representatives, participated in the bidding, which was conducted by the
District Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">T</span><span style="">he latter
declared <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, who had offered P10.00 per square
meter, as against petitioner’s final bid of P9.05 a square meter, as the
highest and successful bidder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> paid the sum of P619.00, as
cash deposit equivalent to 10% of his final bid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, likewise, filled up the bidding form BL
Form No. 28-26, and enclosed therewith the offi­cial receipt evidencing said
cash deposit, as well as offered to reim­burse the value of all the
improvements introduced by the petitioners on the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, in turn, accomplished a similar
form and made a cash deposit of P560.19, representing 10% of their final bid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, petitioners brought the matter to the Director of
Lands, and asked him to annul the bidding, upon the ground that it had been
conducted irregularly, the bidders not having deposited 10% of their initial
bids before the start of the bidding, and the same not having been held in an
open and public place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1962</st1:date>, the Director of
Lands issued an order annulling the aforementioned bidding, on account of the
absence of said deposit of 10% before the commencement of the bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not make a ruling on whether the
bidding had been conducted publicly, this question being one of fact which
could not be determined without prior investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> filed a
motion for reconsideration, which was denied, in view of which, he appealed to
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the latter rendered his decision setting aside the
appealed order of the Director of Lands and upholding the validity of the
bidding held on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1962</st1:date>,
as well as adjudging <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> the highest and
successful bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration,
sought by herein petitioners, having been denied, they appealed to the
President who, a<span style="">cting through the
Executive Secretary, concurred in the findings and conclusions of the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The office of the President having refused to reconsider its stand,
petitioners commenced, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>,
the present action for certiorari and prohibition, with preliminary injunction,
against <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, the Executive Secretary, the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Director of Lands and the
District Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, to set aside
the decision of the Secretary of Agri­culture and Natural Resources and the
ruling of the Executive Secretary, and revive the aforementioned order of the
Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ap­propriate
proceedings, said court of first instance rendered its appealed decision
dismissing the petition herein, without special pronouncement as to costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="GramE">this appeal</span>
taken by the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The latter maintain that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources and the Executive Secretary have committed a grave abuse of
discretion in setting aside the order of the Director of Lands annulling the
award in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, (1) because the provision
of the notice of sale requiring a cash deposit of 10% of the initial bid of
each party, before the bidding took place, had not been complied with; and (2)
be­cause the right "to reject any and all bids" had been
"reserved" by the Director of Lands in said notice of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' claim is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the first
argument, it is conceded that, when the bidding was about to commence, the two
(2) bidders were required by the District Land Officer to put their money on
the table where the bid­ding was about to be held; that, thereupon, petitioners
and <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> placed the sums of P565.00 and P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, respectively, on said table; and that this sum of P2,000.00
of respondent <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> is far in excess of the amount
of deposit required in the notice of sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, respondent public officers did not abuse their
discretion, much less gravely, in considering that said requirement in the notice
of sale had thereby been substantially complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, referring to the deposit required in
connection with the sale of public lands, this Court, in the very case of <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span> v. David</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> cited by petitioners herein, expressed
itself as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">Its</span> purpose is evidently to prevent the presentation of
frivolous bids and to avoid difficulties in the collection of the amount of an
accepted bid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But, while the Director of Lands had the right to reject the
bids, it does not necessarily follow that, if he accepted one of them, a merely
formal defect in the accepted bid would vitiate the award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regulations as well as statutes must be given
a reason­able construction and it seems clear that the provi­sion here in
question is merely directory and not mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, in his decision setting aside the order of the Director of
Lands, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1962</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Agriculture and Na­tural Resources said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
even assuming, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that the for­malities
called for in the notice of bidding were not literally and strictly observed,
the same should not <span style="">be considered
enough to nullify the bid of <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, or even that of <span class="SpellE">Meris</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
opinion of this Office that only for every weighty consideration should the bid
of a person, who had substantially complied with the requirements of the
bidding and had evinced a sincere desire to meet the other requirements pre­paratory
to an award of the land subject of the sale, be nullified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> was willing to pay, and as a matter of fact he
offered the amount, for the value of the unauthorized improve­ments introduced
on the disputed area by <span class="SpellE">Meris</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But despite this and the paramount effort of
the District Land Officer concerned to solve the dispute between the two
bidders, <span class="SpellE">Meris</span> refused to abide by the result of the
bidding."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources
and the Executive Secretary have correctly held that petitioners must be deemed
to have waived, insofar as they are concerned, the require<span style="">ment of a previous deposit, as well as to be
in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to invoke such requirement, because they
had, not only acquiesced in the procedure followed by the District Land Officer
and respondent <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, but, also, induced them to
proceed with the bidding, (1) by placing their (petitioners') money, amounting
to P565.00, on the table, when the bid­ding was about to commence, in the same
way that <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> had put the sum of P2,000.00 on said
table; (2) by participating in the bidding, and making an initial bid of P3.60
a square meter, and gradually in­creasing the same, as <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>
made higher bids, until they (petitioners) made a final bid of P9.05 a square
meter, which was raised by <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> to P10.00 a square
meter; and (3) by filling, after <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> had been
declared the highest and winning bidder, the bidding form BL Form No. 28-26 and
depositing P560.19, which is 10% of their final bid, just like <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, who had deposited P 619.00, representing 10% of his
final bid, and filled and submitted said form.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the Director of Lands had, pursuant to the notice
of sale aforementioned, the right to reject any and all bids, but it is no less
true that decisions and other acts of said officer are <span class="SpellE">appeal­able</span>
to<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and subject to the control of the Secretary of Agriculture, <span style="">and </span>that this power of control entails
the right to review and, hence, to affirm, modify or reverse the decisions and
other determinations of the Director of Lands, and even to substitute him in
the exercise of his judgment and discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to point out that the order of the Director
of Lands, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1962</st1:date>,
annulling the bidding held on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="9">September
 6, 1962</st1:date>, was rendered without giving <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>
an opportunity to be heard, in violation of the elementary principles of due
process.</p>
