VS. EUGENIO MILLADO, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Complainant <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> B. del Rosario
seeks the disbarment of respondent, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Millado</span>, upon the ground that the latter had committed
malpractice, in violation of Article 1491 of the Civil Code of the Philippines
and Canon No. 10 of the Canons of Legal Ethics, by acquiring an interest in the
land involved in a liti­gation in which he had taken part by reason of his
profession; that said interest was adverse to that of his client in the
aforementioned litigation; and that he filed therein <span class="GramE">pleadings</span>
containing allegations which were inconsistent with those made in another
pleading subse­quently filed by him in the same proceedings, as well as false.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to these charges, respondent alleged that his
interest in said land had been acquired before he intervened in said
proceedings, as counsel for one of the parties therein; that his client therein
was aware of his aforementioned interest; that there is no conflict between the
same and that of his client; and that there is neither a false allegation of
facts in the pleadings alluded to in the complaint herein nor any inconsistency
between said pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of
"counterclaim," respondent alleged, also, that the present charges
had been preferred as a means to offset an action for damages and some criminal
charges filed by him against complainant herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due investigation conducted by the office of the Solicitor
General, to whom said charges were referred <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
the afore­mentioned officer submitted his report exonerating, in effect,
respondent herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the provisions of the Civil Code and of the Canons of
Legal <span class="GramE">Ethics,</span> prohibit the purchase by lawyers of any
interest in the subject matter of the litigation in which they participated by
reason of their profession, and complainant herein has not estab­lished a
violation of such injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, respondent introduced evidence, which is <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>,
to the effect that one <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>,
now deceased, claimed title to a tract of land of about 430 hectares, in <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city>; that parts of said land were the object of two
(2) <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, against La Paz <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, one of the
heirs of said deceased, one filed by herein complainant, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
B. del Rosario, and the other by <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Sta. Clara;
that prior to the institution of said cases, one <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baluyot</span>, who claims to be another heir of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, offered to allow
respondent to cons­truct a house on part of said land of about 430 hectares, in
considera­tion of his professional services in defense of the claim thereto of
the <span class="SpellE">Tiburcios</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Baluyot's</span>
understanding with respondent was that, should he succeed in securing a
decision favorable to the <span class="SpellE">Tiburcios</span>, he (respondent)
could buy the land on which his house was built, namely, lots 4 and 5 of Block
E-102 of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, by paying the current value
thereof; that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, who occupied another lot
in the same block, knew that respondent was in possession of said lots 4 and 5
and had constructed a house thereon, by agreement with <span class="SpellE">Baluyot</span>,
as one of the heirs of the deceased; that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
who claimed an interest in the whole Block E-102, asked respondent to be her
counsel in said <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases; that, after filing
the answer of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, as defendant in said two
(2) cases, respondent ceased to be her counsel therein; and that, although in
her aforementioned answer, he alleged that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
was the owner and possessor of the lots involved in said cases, there is no
real inconsistency bet­ween this allegation and his claim over said lots 4 and
5, much less a misrepresentation of facts, because the issue in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases hinged upon the right of possession,
whereas the alleged ownership of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> merely
tended to bolster up her alleged prior possession, and because he could not
acquire title to said lots 4 and 5 from the heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>, unless they -
and, hence, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, as one of the heirs of the
deceased - were the true owners thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the records show that respondent's alleged interest in said
lots was acquired <u>before</u> he intervened as counsel for Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases
against her and that said interest is not necessarily inconsistent with that of
his aforementioned client, aside from the fact that he had made no substantial
misrepresenta­tion in the pleadings filed by him in said cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact and the absence of said conflict
are made more manifest by the circumstance that the charges under consideration
have been preferred, not by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, but by her
opponent in one of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases above
mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding no merit in the complaint herein, the same is,
accordingly, dismissed.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
