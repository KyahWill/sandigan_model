<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This case raises the issue of 
whether or not, under the Public Service Law, Commonwealth Act No. 146, as 
amended, motorboat services for passenger and freight on navigable inland rivers 
require certificates of public convenience from the Public Service 
Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="7" day="9" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 9, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
respondent Angel Forneas filed with the Public Service Commission an amended 
application for a certificate of public convenience for the operation of water 
transportation (motorboats) along the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cagayan</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> between Masical, Amulung and 
Tupang, Alcala, all in the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">province</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cagayan</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, under a rate and time schedule 
authorized by the said Commission. The petitioners, who are themselves owners 
and operators of motorboats with permits and certificates of ownership issued by 
the Bureau of Customs and engaged in ferry and/or coastwise trade for passengers 
and cargoes in, among others, the line above applied for, opposed the 
aforementioned application on the grounds that the applicant was not financially 
capable to undertake the proposed venture and that the said d service was 
already being adequately rendered by them. Subsequently, too, the herein 
petitioners filed a motion to dismiss the above application on the ground that 
the Public Service Commission had no jurisdiction over its subject matter under 
Section 13(a) of the Public Service Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In a decision dated 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="16" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 16, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
respondent Commission denied the petitioner's motion to dismiss and granted the 
certificate applied for. The Commissioner expressly found that the applicant was 
legally and financially qualified for the proposed service and that public 
necessity and convenience demanded the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioners contend that 
under Section 13(a) of the Public Service Act, Commonwealth Act No. 146, as 
amended, the respondent Commission has no authority to issue a certificate of 
public convenience for the motorboats covered by the application of respondent 
Angel Forneas which are, according to the said Commission, just about 2.03 net 
tons each. On the other hand, the herein respondents maintain that exemption 
from a prior certificate of public convenience granted by the said section is 
exclusive to vessels of more than three tons devoted to interisland service and 
not inland passenger transportation service over municipal 
rivers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The provision of the Public 
Service Act which the petitioners claim denies to the respondent Commission the 
authority to issue certificates of public convenience for motorboat services on 
navigable inland rivers reads as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 13(a) The Commission shall 
have jurisdiction, supervision, and control over all public services and their 
franchises, equipment, and other properties, and in the exercise of its 
authority, it shall have the necessary powers and the aid of the public force: 
Provided, That public service owned or operated by government-owned or 
controlled corporations shall be regulated by the Commission in the same way as 
privately-owned public services, but certificates of public convenience or 
certificates of public convenience and necessity shall not be required of such 
corporations: And provided, further, That it shall have no authority to require 
steamboats, motorships and steamship lines, whether privately-owned or owned or 
operated by any Government controlled corporation or instrumentality to obtain 
certificate of public convenience or to prescribe their definite routes of 
service."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It impresses us as relevant that 
the above-quoted section, relative to the issue under consideration, speaks 
alone of "steamboats, motorships and steamship lines." In the next succeeding 
paragraph in which the same section defines the term "public service,"<span class="style2style1"></span></span><span class="style21"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span class="style2style1"></span> it speaks of the same subject matter 
and yet employs different descriptive denominations, to wit: "steamboat or 
steamship line, pontines, ferries, and water craft." (Sec. 13(b) Evidently, 
therefore, the law contemplates to exempt from the requisite certificate of 
public convenience not every species or kind of water vessel but only such as 
would properly fall within the class of "steamboats, motorships and steamship 
lines." Otherwise, it would not have been so particular with the above 
distinction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In drawing the line between 
"steamboats, motorships, and steamship lines" on one side and "pontines, 
ferries, and water crafts" on the other, Congress apparently means to accept the 
view that "boat, craft and water craft" are usually applied to small vessels, 
while larger vessels are usually referred to by the terms "steamer, steamship or 
vessel." (The Saxon, D.C.S.C. 269, 641; 40 Words and Phrases 215) and that in 
its generic sense "ship" means any seagoing craft larger than an undecked boat. 
(Swan v. U.S., 19 Ct. C1. 51). In fact, this Court has previously construed the 
above specification of "steamboats, motorships and steamship lines," as used in 
Section 13(a) of the Public Service Act, as referring alone to vessels of 
"considerable tonnage" and employed to sea service "involving more or less great 
distances and over more or less turbulent and dangerous waters of the open sea." 
(Javellana et al. v. Public Service Commission, 98 Phil. 964; Jugueta et al, v. 
Public Service Commission, G. R. No. L-12044, </span><st1:date month="5" day="20" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 
20, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">). For really, "steamboats, 
motorships, and steamship lines," as the said terms are accepted in Common and 
commercial parlance, refer only to sea vehicles engaged in coastwise or 
interisland service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the premises, therefore, 
motorboats and water crafts intended for and actually devoted to inter-municipal 
transportation service, plying on inland water routes like municipal rivers and 
channels, must be set apart from the vehicles specified in Section 13 (a) which, 
by their very size, nature and purpose, are incapable of navigating on municipal 
rivers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To be sure, then, this Court 
reads Section 13, paragraph (a) of the Public Service Act, in relation to 
paragraph (b) of the same section, as providing that when the vessel is of a 
tonnage and engineering properly accepted for steamers, steamships and liners, 
and the same is essentially for and actually devoted to inter-island service, it 
is exempt from securing from the Public Service Commission a prior certificate 
of public convenience. Otherwise, when it is of a size and construction as to be 
fit merely for river navigation, it must first secure from the said Commission 
the above certificate before it may set about as a common carrier. This does not 
seem to us to be an entirely new rule considering that as far back as some 
fourteen years ago, in the case of Municipality of Gattaran v. Elizaga, 91 Phil. 
440, decided May 28, 1952, we held that – <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"x x x When a private party, 
winner in a public bidding conducted by the Municipal Council, like Fruto 
Elizaga, get the permit to operate a municipal ferry from the municipality, 
before he can operate, he must first obtain a certificate or permit from the 
Public Service Commission which upon granting it will fix the rates to be 
charged by him as well as specify the kind of equipment to be used by him for 
the comfort, convenience and safety of the public using the ferry. x x x." 
(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Apart from the legislative 
intention apparent from the text of Section 13 (a) of the Public Service Act -- 
this Court has gone through the records of the proceedings which attended the 
passage of the said law and its amendments but found no material or 
documentation of a debate on the said section - still another consideration 
commends itself to the conclusion we have reached. Inasmuch as judicial notice 
may be held of the fact that the Bureau of Customs does not have adequate 
offices or agencies to oversee watercrafts on every inland or municipal rivers, 
all its resources and personnel being devoted to the control, regulation and 
supervision of port or pier affairs, public interest stands much to gain from 
the requirement that passenger motorboats on inland municipal rivers should 
first secure from the Public Service Commission due authorization to so operate 
as a common carrier. For, otherwise, they would be free from any effective 
government supervision. On one hand, the Bureau of Customs is more than laden 
with its duties at the ports; on the other, the Public Service Commission, 
without the certificate of public convenience, can hardly exact discipline from 
the motorboat operators. The power of the said Commission to demand compliance 
with its rules and regulations for the safety and convenience of general public 
is potent and real only to the extent that it is conceded the power to cancel or 
revoke the certificate of authorization of every public service. Exempted from 
such certificates, therefore, motorboats operators would be beyond the said 
Commission's sphere of effective discipline.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The attack on the 
respondent-applicant's financial capacity cannot be seriously entertained in 
this appeal. The finding of the Public Service Commission thereon is essentially 
a factual determination which, in a host of cases, this Court has said it will 
not interfere unless patently unsupported by evidence. A review of the records 
of this case does not warrant such an interference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">FOR ALL THE 
FOREGOING</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed. No pronouncement as to 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
