				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 23, 1930, the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ca­vite</span>, under authority of Act No. 667, granted the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Electric Co., Inc. through Resolution No. <span style="">46, </span>the fran­chise to operate in that
municipality an electric plant, imposing upon said company the franchise tax of
one per cent <span style="">of
</span>its gross receipts for the first twenty (20) years and two per cent
thereof for the next fifteen (15) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> on <st1:date year="1946" day="1" month="10">October <span style="">1, </span>1946</st1:date> of Republic Act 39,
which amended Sec. 259 of the Tax Code to read, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 259.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Tax on
corporate franchises</u>. ? There shall be collected in respect to all
existing and future franchises, upon the gross earnings or receipts from the
business co­vered by the law granting the franchise a tax of five <u>per</u> <u><span style="">centum</span></u><span style=""> </span>or such taxes, charges, and percentages as are specified in the
spe­cial charters of the corporations upon whom such franchises are conferred,
whichever is higher, unless the provisions thereof pre­clude the imposition of
a higher tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of
facilitating the assessment of this tax, reports shall be made by the res­pective
holders of the franchises in such form and at such times as shall be required
by the regulations of the Department of <span style="">Fin</span>ance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The taxes, charges, and percentages on corporate franchises
shall be due and payable as specified in the particular franchise, or, in case
no time limit is specified therein, the provisions of section one hundred
eighty-three shall apply; and if such taxes, char­ges, and percentages remain
unpaid for fif­teen days from and after the date on which they must be paid,
twenty-five <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> shall be added to the amount of such
taxes, charges, and percentages, which increase shall form part of the
tax."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Imus</span></span><span style=""> </span>Electric Co., Inc., paid franchise tax at the rate of <span style="">5% </span>of its gross receipts, until
sometime in 1953 <span style="">when </span>it filed a
claim for refund of payments made at the afore­said rate of <span style="">5% </span>for the period from <st1:date year="1948" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1948</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="12">Decem­ber 31, 1951</st1:date>, inclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said claim for refund was granted as to the
period from <st1:date year="1950" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1950</st1:date> to
<st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, on <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1961</st1:date>,
<span style="">assessed </span><span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
Electric <span style="">Co., Inc., </span>at the 5%
rate pursuant to Sec. <span style="">259 </span>of the
Tax Code as amended by Republic Act <span style="">39,
</span>demanding payment of deficien­cy tax and surcharge of P58,510.41 for the
period from <st1:date year="1948" day="1" month="7">July 1, <span style="">1948</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>to <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">September <span style="">30, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Finding,
however, that the time to assess had prescribed for the period <u>be­fore</u> <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="1"><span style="">January </span>1,
 <span style="">1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>said Commissioner issued another
assessment on <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1961</st1:date>,
for <st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1956</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">September <span style="">30,
 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>for a
deficiency franchise tax, at the 5% rate aforementioned, of P24,752.26 plus
25%, surcharge of P6,188.07, or <span style="">a </span>total of P30,940.33.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon refusal of the Commissioner to reconsider the assessment, <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Electric Co., Inc., on November 11, 1963, petitioned
the Court of Tax Appeals for the review of the Commissioner's ruling, alleging
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The franchise in its favor is
a private contract which would be impaired by the application of Section <span style="">259 </span>of the Tax Code as amen­ded by Republic
Act <span style="">39 </span>and this would be in
violation of the non-impairment clause of the Constitution; and (2) Sec­tion
259 of the Tax Code as amended is a general law which has not repealed the
franchise and as such applies only to charter provisions which do not specify
the rate of fran­chise tax to be <span style="">paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Tax Appeals, citing the case of <span class="SpellE">Lealda</span>
Electric <span style="">Co. </span>v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, G.R. No. <span style="">L-16428, </span>April
<span style="">30, </span>1963, affirmed on December <span style="">16, </span>1963, the Com­missioner of
Internal Revenue's decision declaring peti­tioner subject to the franchise tax
of five per cent according to Section 259 of the Internal Revenue Code as
amended by Republic <span style="">Act 39 </span>because
its franchise "contains an express reservation that it is subject to amend­ment
or repeal and that the same contains no provision that the tax therein
prescribed shall be in lieu of all other taxes, municipal, provincial or <span style="">national."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said decision is brought before Us by the petitioner for
determination of whether or not Section 259 of the Tax Code has repealed the
corresponding provision in pe­titioner's franchise and the applicability of the
<span class="SpellE"><u>Lealda</u></span> and <st1:state><st1:place><u>Hidalgo</u></st1:place></st1:state><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">While admitting the existence of the express reser­vation for
amendment or repeal in its franchise, peti­tioner denies that Section 259 of
the Tax Code as amended by Republic Act <span style="">39,
</span>is an exercise of such reserved power to amend and argues further that
the absence of the phrase "in lieu of all other taxes, municipal,
provincial or na­tional" does not justify the conclusion that the fixing
of the tax rates in the franchise was not intended to ex­clude all other
subsequent impositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, such legis­lative
intent is allegedly gleaned from the fact that spe­cific rates of the franchise
tax were provided for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner
wishes to take exception to the application of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lealda</u></span>
case because unlike the present case where the tax rates w<span style="">ere</span><span style=""> </span>specified, the franchise in said case not only lacked the
phrase exempting it from other charges but al­so did not state the specific
rates to be charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lealda</u></span> case, We held that
as amended by Repu­blic Act <span style="">39, </span>Section
259 of the Tax Code became the basic tax law not only because it was entitled
"Tax on Corporate Franchises” but also because it "fixed the rate of
franchise tax to be paid by holders of <u>all existing and future franchises</u>."
(Underscoring as quoted) We had oc­casion to expound on this ruling in <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span> Power Plant Co. v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
a case similar­ly situated with our present one, where the franchises in favor
of the petitioner were issued by the Municipal Coun­cils of <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Samal</span>, also in pursuance to Act No. 667 with also
the same franchise tax rates - i.e., 1% of the gross earnings of the petitioner
for the first 20 years and 2% for the remaining 15 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In upholding the applicability of Section 259
of the Tax Code as amen­ded, this Court speaking through present Chief Justice
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, held:</p>

<blockquote>"At the outset, it should be noted that the status of
petitioner's municipal franchi­ses as property and property right is depen­dent
upon or qualified by the nature and li­mitations of the authority under which
said franchises were granted by the municipal cor­porations concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, such autho­rity, as regards the
franchises for <span class="SpellE">Balanga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Samal</span>,
emanated from Act No. 667, pursuant to which franchises granted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> shall be 'subject to the power of Congress to
alter, modify or repeal the same'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
the extent that Section 259 of our National Internal Revenue Code is
inconsistent with the rate of taxes fixed in said municipal fran­chises - and
the theory that said Section 259 as applied to petitioner herein is unconsti­tutional,
necessarily implies such inconsis­tency - it is obvious that, for all intents
and purposes, said legal provision alters the pertinent provisions of said
franchises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effecting such
alteration, our <span class="SpellE">legialative</span> department has merely
exercised, however, a power expressly reserved thereto by said fran­chises, and
has acted, therefore, <u>in</u> <u>confor­mity</u> therewith, <u>not</u> <span style="">in violation o</span>f the pro<span style="">visions </span>thereof or to the detriment of
the rights thereby vested in petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither can We, as the petitioner would Urge Us, ap­ply the <u>Hidalgo</u>
case, supra, for the appeal in that case did not involve the applicability of
Section <span style="">259 </span>of the Tax Code as
amended but rather the application of the tax rates to be imposed <u>after the
life of the franchise had been extended for another 25 years</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the imposition of <span style="">25% </span>surcharge, however, in Connell Bros. Co. v. Collector of
Internal Revenue,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled that the surcharge may be dispensed with where the taxpayers'
delay to pay the tax was in good faith due to misunderstanding of revenue
regulations ap­plicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
herein was in such good faith in its delay in payment of the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that it should not be made to pay
the <span style="">25% </span>surcharge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is affirmed with the
modification that the <span style="">25% </span>surcharge
imposed on petitioner should be, and <span style="">is,
</span>eliminated, thereby redu­cing the tax from a total of P30,<span style="">9</span><span style="">40.33 </span>(with surcharge) to P24,752.26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
