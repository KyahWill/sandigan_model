				<H3>PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK AND DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE
PHILIPPINES, PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE MILLING CO., INC.,
HECTOR TORRES, FRANCISCO GOMEZ AND COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In their petition herein,
the Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines -
hereinafter referred to, respectively, as the PNB and DBP - pray that writs of
certiorari, prohibition and mandamus be issued annulling certain resolutions of
the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. Nos. 35253-R and 35254-R thereof, and
prohibiting said Court from assuming jurisdiction over these cases, as well as
directing the Court to dismiss the appeal therein taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said petitioners prayed, also, that a writ of
preliminary injunction be issued during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the present case, but such auxiliary relief has not been granted, although
the petition herein was given due course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The aforementioned
appeals had been taken by the Philippine Milling Co., Inc., Francisco Gomez,
Hector Torres and Federico Santiago, from a decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, in Civil Cases Nos. 42133 and 42322 thereof, entitled,
respectively, "Philippine Milling Co. v. Development Bank of the
Philippines, Philippine National Bank and Register of Deeds of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Occidental", and "Development Bank of the
Philippines v. </span><span style="">Philippine
Milling Co., et al.," dismissing the first case and order­ing the
defendants, in the second case, "particularly the Secretary of the
Philippine Milling Co. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> to transfer in the stock
book of the corporation in the name of the DBP the 15,000 shares of stocks
covered by Certificate of Stock No. 32, now in the name of the re­spondents
Hector A. Torres and Francisco M. Gomez, and to issue a new certificate of
stock in lieu thereof in favor of the DBP," with costs against said
defendants in the Court of First Instance and appellants in the Court of
Appeals, but respondents in the present original action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing with the Court of Appeals of their printed record
on appeal, respondents herein were required to submit therein their brief as
appellants, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After securing two (2) extensions thereof,
the last of which was to expire on November 11, 1966, respondents moved for a
third exten­sion of 15 days, which was granted on November 14, <u>but for 10
days only</u>, to expire on November 21, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1966</st1:date>,
respondents asked a fourth extension of thirty (30) days "counted from <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1966</st1:date>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date last mentioned, the DBP - as one
of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the two cases - objected to said
extension and moved to dismiss the appeal, upon the ground that the extension
had been sought late, the previous extension having expired on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without touching upon this opposition and
motion to dismiss, on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="11">November 28,
 1966</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals granted the 30-day extension applied
for, counted from <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1966</st1:date>,
the PNB - another <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in CA-G.R. No. 35253-R -
moved to dismiss the appeal, upon the ground relied upon by the DBP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both motions to dismiss were denied by the
Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seemingly unaware of the resolution to this
effect, on <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1966</st1:date>,
the DBP filed another motion urging that its motion to dismiss be acted
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PNB, in turn, filed, on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1966</st1:date>, a motion for
reconsideration of the resolution of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for reconsideration was, on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1966</st1:date>, denied by the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, or on
December 23, 1966, the PNB and DBP commenced the present action to annul said
reso­lutions of the Court of Appeals dated December 2 and 9, 1966, to restrain
or prohibit the Court of Appeals from hearing the afore­mentioned cases CA-G.R.
Nos. 35253-R and 35254-R, and to compel said Court to dismiss the appeals
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition herein is based upon the premise that, owing to
respondents' failure to file a motion for extension, on or before November 21,
1966, when the third extension granted to them expired, "the Court of
Appeals already lost jurisdiction to try the case and <span style="">proceed further, but has not only the power but also the duty to dis­miss
the appeal." This pretense is clearly untenable, for, pursuant to Section
1 of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, "(a)n appeal <u>may</u> be dis­missed
by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>" upon the ground, among others, of "(f)<span class="SpellE">ailure</span> of the appel­lant x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to serve and file the required number </span>of <span style="">copies of his brief," within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Manifestly, this provision confers a power and does not impose a
duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it is directory, not
mandatory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Contrary to petitioners'
assertion that, on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="11"><span style="">November 22, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, "it became its (Court of Appeals')
ministerial duty to dismiss the ap­peal and remand the case for execution to
the Court of origin," the Court of Appeals had, under said provision of
the Rules of Court, <u>dis­cretion</u> to dismiss or <u>not</u> to dismiss
respondents' appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although said
discretion must be a sound one, to be exercised in accordance with the tenets
of justice and fair play, having in mind the circum­stances obtaining in each
case, the presumption is that it has been so exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was incumbent upon herein petitioners, as
actors in the case at bar, to offset this presumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the record before us does not
satisfactorily show that the Court of Appeals has abused its discretion, much
less gravely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' assertion of
abuse of discretion is predicated solely upon the alleged
"ministerial" duty of said Court to dismiss the appeal therein, which
is devoid of legal foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
inconsistent with our views in <span class="SpellE">Viuda</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ordoveza</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Alquiza</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Alquiza</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
