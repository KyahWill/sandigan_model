on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July <span style="">12, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>dismissing
her complaint in Civil Case No. 3214-M, on the ground that the cause of action
stated therein was already barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="5">May 19, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> appellant filed an
action in the </span>lower court against the spouses <span style="">Gregorio </span><span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> to <span style="">recover </span>ownership

<p class="BODY">After being <span style="">summoned <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed </span>on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1965</st1:date> a motion to dismiss the
complaint on <span style="">the ground </span>that the
cause of action alleged therein was already barred by the statute <span style="">of limitations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the parties, the lower court issued the appealed
order which appellant now urges us to reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue before us therefore is whether or not, upon the
facts pleaded in the complaint, it appears that appellant's cause of action had
already prescribed when the action was commenced on <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pertinent to the above
issue are the allegations made in Paragraphs 7, </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">9, 10 and 11 of the
complaint of the following tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"VII</p>

<blockquote>That on December <span style="">26, 1946, </span>defendants,
with evident bad faith and notwithstanding the fact that they were already
charged with the knowledge and information of the contract entered into in <span style="">1943 </span>by plaintiff with Antonio de <span class="SpellE">Pano</span>, connived and confederated with the latter in buying
again from him the same parcel of land covered by Tax Declaration No. 8164, as
evidenced by a document <span style="">purporting to
be a </span><span style="">"PAGBIBILIHANG
</span><span style="">PATULUYAN" and appearing to
be covered by </span><span style="">"inst. </span><span style="">No. 106, Folio
No. 4, <span class="SpellE">Libro</span> IV, <span class="SpellE">Serie</span> de

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VIII</p>

<blockquote>That under date of April 25, 1947, defendants declared the abovementioned
land in their names under Tax Declaration No. 9020, to begin "with the
year 1948", and at the same time unlawfully effected the double <span style="">cancellation </span>of
Tax Declaration No. 8164, notwithstanding and defying the fact that said Tax
Declaration No. 8164 had already been cancelled by Tax Declaration <span style="">No. 8991 </span>earlier
issued in the name of plaintiff;</blockquote>

to declare the land in question under Tax Declaration No. 295 in their names, bearing
the following particulars which tally with those appearing in plaintiff's own
tax declaration, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Location of property - S. Sebastian, <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>,

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">X</p>

<blockquote>That plaintiff came to know of <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> second sale when
defendants, <span style="">in </span>apparent furtherance
of <span style="">their conveyance with </span>Antonio
de <span class="SpellE">Paño</span>, unlawfully and wantonly erected their <span style="">house in the land in question in 1947;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XI</p>

<blockquote>That when plaintiff learned of defendants’ unlawful occupation,
plaintiff immediately informed defendants that they had no rights to occupy the
land and that <span style="">they </span>should vacate
<span style="">the </span>same, but <span style="">defendants </span>refused to <span style="">do so, </span>alleging that they also bought <span style="">the </span>same property from <span style="">Antonio </span><span style="">de <span class="SpellE">Pano</span> and <span style="">passing </span>the <span style="">responsibility
for the double sale to the </span></span><span style="">latter,”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 13 of the same pleading also alleges that when appellant
made demands to vacate the property, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
refused to vacate the same claiming ownership thereof and alleging further that
they had already secured a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title over the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection it really
appears that, after appropriate proceedings, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
had registered the land in their name in accordance with the pro<span style="">visions of </span><span style="">Act </span><span style="">No. 496 </span>and
that Original Certificate of Title No. 0-39 had been issued in their name on
November 25, 1947 by virtue of the decision rendered on September 22 of the
same year (Record on Appeal Pages 13, 18-19).</p>

<p class="BODY">From all the foregoing it appears that appellant came to know of
the sale made by Antonio de <span class="SpellE">Pano</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> since the year 1947; that after the sale <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> took possession of the land in question, declared
it in their name for tax purposes and built their house thereon; that prior to
September 22, 1947 <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> instituted appropriate
registration proceedings in which they secured judgment in <span style="">their </span>favor on the date aforesaid, Original
Certificate of Title No. 0-39 having been issued in their name on November 25
of the same year; that appellant filed the present action to recover ownership
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>possession of the land in question
and/or to compel <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the same to her, only on May 19, 1965, that is, 18 years after the issuance of
the Original Certificate of Title mentioned heretofore; and that appellant came
to know of the sale made by Antonio de <span class="SpellE">Pano</span> in favor
of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the year 1947 - again almost 20 years
before the filing of the action at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts set forth above, it seems clear that whether we
consider appellant's action <span style="">as an <span class="SpellE"><u>a</u><u><span style="">ccion</span></u></span></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>reinvindicatoria</u></span> or as a personal action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, the filing of her complaint was made long
after the expiration of the corresponding period of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the undisputed facts of the case likewise show that
even <span style="">considering
</span>appellant's action as one to secure - on the ground of fraud ? <span style="">the </span><span style="">annulment </span><span style="">of the Deed of Sale executed </span>by De <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pano</span></span><span style=""> in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
or of the proceedings that resulted in the registration of the property </span><span style="">in the name of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
the action appears to have been filed long after the expiration of the corresponding
period of prescription.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the "implied trust" relied upon by appellant
in her <span class="GramE">brief,</span> all that we need to say is that the
facts alleged in her complaint are utterly insufficient to constitute an
allegation of extrinsic <span style="">fraud
sufficient to </span>justify the annulment <span style="">of the registration proceedings mentioned above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, finding no error in the appealed order, the
same is hereby affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
