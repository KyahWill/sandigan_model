				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>
from the judgment of the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
in Civil Case No. 1272 ordering fore­closure of the mortgage constituted on a
piece of land by defendant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> who, by
falsifying a public document, had secured a transfer certificate of title in
his name to the land previously sold to <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
by its registered owner, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
was the registered owner with Certifi­cate of Title No. 9125 of Lot No. 15679
with an area of 26,530 square meters, situated at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lipa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="6">June
 11, 1959</st1:date>, she sold to Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> by
means of a public instrument an undivided portion of 11,530 <span style="">square </span>meters of the lot for the
price of P938.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same month and
year, she sold to Victoria <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> by means of a
private instrument the remaining portion of 15,000 square meters for the price
of P5<span class="GramE">,851.40</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Long before and at the time of the sales, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span>
<span class="GramE">and</span> Victoria <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> were
in possession of the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vendor's
Cer­tificate of Title No. 9125 was not delivered to the ven­dees because it was
in the possession of another person to whom the lot had been mortgaged by <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="12">December 29,
 1961</st1:date>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, by falsi­fying a
public document of conveyance, succeeded in having Certificate of Title No.
9125 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>
cancelled and a new Transfer Certificate of Title No.T-10392 issued in his
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show when and
how he had obtained possession of the owner's duplicate certi­ficate of title.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1961</st1:date>,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> mortgaged the lot to Leonora T. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> as security for a loan of P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
with interest at 6% per annum, payable within a period of ninety (90)
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagor's title having been
delivered to the mortgagee, she caused the instrument to be re­gistered on the
back of the said transfer certificate of title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1962</st1:date>, the
mortgagee, Leonora T. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, instituted the instant
foreclosure suit against the mortga­gor, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>,
the latter having failed or refused to pay the obligation on its due date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant was la­ter declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1962</st1:date>, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Moji­ca</span>
and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> moved to intervene and that
their complaint in intervention annexed to the motion <span class="GramE">be</span>
admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleged that
they were the owners of the lot, having purchased the same from <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> in June, 1959; that
title to said land was fraudulently transferred by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>
in his name; that Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> mortgaged the land
in favor of plaintiff Leonora T. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>; that said
mortgagor had been convicted of "Falsification of Public Document by a
Private Individual," and the document used by him in trans­ferring title
in his name was the subject of the said felony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> prayed that they be declared
the true and ab­solute owners of the parcel of land covered by Transfer Certi­ficate
of Title No. T-10392; that whatever document was execut­ed by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> in transferring the ownership of the land in his
name be declared null and void; and that Transfer Certi­ficate of Title No.
T-10392 be ordered cancelled and another title issued in the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>' names.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered its decision find­ing that
the mortgage was validly constituted and its fore­closure was in order, that
"this is not the time and place for them (<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>)
to raise their claim of ownership over the property," and that the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> were not entitled to any relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was rendered ordering foreclosure of
the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this judgment the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court, however, certified the appeal to
this Court on the ground that it involves only questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants contend that the lower court erred in not
considering the complaint in intervention as timely and appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether the complaint in
intervention was seasonably filed is now beside the point, considering that the
lower court had previously granted the motion for leave to file the said
complaint, and its order allowing the motion has not been questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, although the defendant had been dec­lared
in default, the court, after the plaintiff had rest­ed her case, allowed the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> to present their evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint in intervention was
appropriate, be­cause the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, as alleged
owners of the land sought to be foreclosed by the plaintiff, have an interest
in the matter in litigation of such direct and immediate character that they
stand to gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment
(Garcia, etc., et al., vs. David, et al., 67 Phil., 279).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants also contend that the lower court erred "in
not declaring the contract of mortgage between the plain­tiff and defendant as
null and void and consequently in not dismissing forthwith plaintiff's action
for foreclosure of mortgage.” The contention is unmeritorious in view of the
following considerations:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint in
intervention was to vindicate ownership of the land in the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deeds of sale involving the parcel of
land covered by Certificate of Title No. 9125 in the name of the vendor, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, not having been
registered, the said <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> did not acquire
ownership of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well
settled that in case of sale of a piece of land titled under the Tor­rens
System, it is the act of registration, and not tra­dition, that transfers the
ownership of the land sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Agbulos</span> vs. Alberto, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-17483, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 31, 1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, cit­ing Sec.
50, Act 496; <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>,

43 Phil., 371; Worcester vs. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> 34 Phil., 646.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The vendees-<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> not having
acquired the owner­ship of the land, their action to vindicate ownership must
fail because such action can prosper only upon proof by plaintiff that he is
the owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out, the <span class="SpellE">inter­venors</span> did not acquire ownership of the land because
their deeds of sale were not registered.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next question before
us is whether the mortgage was valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 2085 of the New Civil Code requires that the mortgagor be the
owner of the property mortgaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al­though
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> was not the owner of the property
mortgaged because he had secured title thereto thru fraud or falsification of a
public document (C.N. Hodges vs. <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Buncio</span> &amp; Co., Inc., et al., G.R. No. L-16096, October
30, 1962), the mortgage was valid because Leonora T. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
was an innocent mortgagee for value, having relied upon the mortgagor's
transfer certificate of title which according to the Register of Deeds was
genuine and free from any ob­jection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the case of De Lara, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ayrosa</span>,
G.R. No.</span> L-6122, May 31, 1954, this Court held that where the
certificate of title was <u>already in the name of the forger</u> when the land
was sold to an innocent purchaser, the vendee had the right to rely on what
appeared in the certificate and, in the absence of anything to excite
suspicion, was under no obligation to look beyond the certificate and in­vestigate
the title of the vendor appearing on the face of said certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the recent case of Morales Develop­ment
Company, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. L-26572, <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1969</st1:date>, this Court, speaking
thru Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, said:</p>

<blockquote>"Morales argues that it was not enough for the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> to have gone to the office of the Re­gister of Deeds
and found therein that there were no flaws in the title of the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span> * **.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[T]he <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> were not bound to check the deeds of conveyance by
Reyes to the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>, and by <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>
to Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having found that 'the own­er's
duplicate copy of TCT No. 21037, in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Abellas</span>,
was a genuine copy of the original on file with the office of the Register of
Deeds, the <span class="SpellE">Deseos</span> were fully justified in re­lying
upon said TCT No. 21037, and had no legal obligation to make further
investigation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The principles enunciated in these cases
are, in our opi­nion, applicable to a mortgagee in good faith and for va­lue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> were
negligent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the ven­dor did not
deliver to them her duplicate certificate of title, they should have consulted
a good lawyer who could have advised them to protect their rights by filing
with the Office of the Register of Deeds an adverse claim un­der Section 110 of
Act No. 496<span class="GramE">,as</span> amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they filed an adverse claim, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> would not have been able to obtain cancellation
of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw's</span>
certificate of title and the issuance of a <span style="">new </span>transfer certificate of title in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were, thus, negligent, and their
negligence was the proximate cause of their loss.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the judgment appealed from is
affirmed without prejudice to allowing the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-appellants
to make the deposit mentioned in the appealed judgment within ninety (90) days
from date of finality of the judgment of this Court, and without prejudice to
the vendees, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, bring­ing an action against the vendor, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, for the enforcement
of said vendor's warranty against eviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
