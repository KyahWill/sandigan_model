				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal stems from a complaint filed by Maria Salao Vda. de Santos before 
the Municipal Court of Manila praying for the refund of P390.50 allegedly paid 
by her in employing three housemaids thru defendants as owners and operators of 
the Gloria Employment Agency. 
<p>On March 19, 1958, defendants filed their answer with a counterclaim 
admitting some of the items mentioned in the complaint but denying having 
received the extra charge of P60.00. After trial, the court rendered judgment 
ordering defendants to pay plaintiff the sum of P390.00, plus P100.00 as 
attorney's fees, and the costs of suit. </p>
<p>Defendants appealed to the court of first instance and after the issues were 
joined, the court set the case for hearing on August 27, 1958, where, instead of 
presenting their evidence, the parties submitted a stipulation of facts from 
which the following may be deduced: On three different occasions the Gloria 
Employment Agency secured for plaintiff the services of three housemaids: Ivonne 
Provido on May 23, 1957, Yolanda Jaime on July 14, 1957, and Vicenta Novalis on 
July 23, 1957, each to work for a period of one year at a monthly salary of 
P20.00 each. For this service, plaintiff paid defendants the following amounts: 
P154.50 representing the office and tax fees of the Agency at P51.50 for each of 
the three housemaids; P176.00 representing the debts of said maids advanced by 
the Agency to wit: P62.00 for Ivonne Provido; P62.00 for Yolanda Jaime; and 
P52.00 for Vicenta Novalis.</p>
<p>On September 11, 1957, the maids escaped and having been informed thereof 
defendants located and delivered the maids, to plaintiff, but the latter 
returned them to the Agency on December 7, 1957. On December 14, 1957, plaintiff 
wrote defendants demanding the refund of the amount of P390.00 claimed to have 
originally paid by her to which defendants replied offering to reimburse only 
the amount of P116.90, and as plaintiff was not agreeable to the proposal she 
instituted the present action. With respect to the damages and attorney's fees 
claimed by both parties, the same were left to the discretion of the court. </p>
<p>On November 3, 1958, the court <em>a quo</em> sentenced defendants to pay 
plaintiff the sum of P390.00, plus P200.00 as attorney's fees and expenses of 
litigation. In due time, defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals but the 
latter certified the case to us for the reason that there are no questions of 
fact involved. </p>
<p>The amount of P390.50 claimed by appellee is itemized as follows:</p>

<p>"Provided, however, that, if the employer terminated the contract of 
employment for a valid or sufficient cause, he shall have the option of either 
getting a refund or an exchange, in accordance with the above schedules: *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*."</p></blockquote>
<p>It would appear from the above that an office fee not to exceed P50.00 may be 
charged by an employment agency against an employer for each recruit which shall 
be for the exclusive account of the employer, while on the other hand, when a 
recruit placed by the Agency terminates his contract of employment without 
having been dismissed by the employer, the latter is entitled to a refund from 
the Agency of certain percentage of the fee paid by the employer in accordance 
with the schedule set forth therein. There is no dispute that on September 11, 
1957 the three maids herein involved escaped from the house of their em- ployer 
for reasons that do not appear clear in the record but who upon being detected 
were returned to their employer who however chose not to re-employ them thereby 
terminating their contract of employment. It may therefore be said that the 
three maids chose to leave the service of their employer without having been 
dismissed by the latter thus giving the employer the right to ask for a refund 
of the fees paid by her to the Agency in the manner provided for in the contract 
and in the rules above-quoted. In this sense, the employer is entitled to a 
refund of P62.50 computed as follows: P12.50 for Ivonne Provido, P25.00 for 
Yolanda Jaime, and P25.00 for Vicenta Novalis.</p>
<p>In our opinion this is the only item which the employer may recover from the 
Agency considering the contract and the rules already adverted to. Thus, the 
employer cannot be reimbursed of the tax fees she paid for the three maids in 
the total sum of P4.50 for they are due the government. The employer is not also 
entitled to the refund of the alleged extra charge of P60.00 for there is 
nothing in the record to show any reason or justification for the payment of 
such extra charge. No evidence has been presented to this effect. And with 
regard to the sum of P176.00 which was paid by the employer to the Agency as 
reimbursement for the personal obligations of the maids advanced by the latter, 
the evidence is clear that such indebtedness/ if any, is only chargeable against 
the maids for he had. personally assumed to pay it in the contract of employment 
entered into between them and the employer (Exhibits B, D and F). By entering 
into the contract, the implication is that the employer has relieved the Agency 
from its liability therefor in the event the maids terminate their employment 
before the period agreed upon. There is, moreover, on the back of each of the 
receipts issued by the Agency to the employer a notation of this tenor: 
"Important: <em>In case of escape the Agency does not guarantee the accounts of 
the servant-employee</em>", which shows that the Agency has not assumed any 
subsidiary liability for the accounts of the maids. It is therefore clear that 
of the items claimed by the employer, she is only entitled to a refund in the 
sum of P62.5O. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is modified by ordering appellants to 
pay appellee only the amount of P62.50, without pronouncement as to costs. 
Considering the outcome of this case, the item relative to attorney's fees 
should also be eliminated.</p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion,
