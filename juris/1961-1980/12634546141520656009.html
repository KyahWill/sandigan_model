				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is not clear from the record whether this is an original
action for certiorari, or whether the Philippine Air Lines, Inc. - hereinafter
referred to as petitioner - mere­ly seeks the review by certiorari of a
resolution of the Court of Appeals, the pertinent part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment render­ed by this Court, as well as
the appealed judg­ment, is hereby VACATED, and a new trial is granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court is directed to receive the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matro</span>
and to render a new decision in the case thereafter, as may be warranted by the
facts established by the whole evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let the records of this case be remanded to
the court of origin to accomplish this purpose.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In either case, the contested resolution must be <span style="">up</span><span style="">held.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 8 1958, <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and the
Philippine Air Lines Employees Association (PALEA) – hereinafter referred to
collectively as respondents – filed, against pet</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">tioner Civil</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Case No. 37135 of the Court of Instance of
Manila, for the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> as
petitioner’s employee, with back salaries, damages and attorney’s fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, petitioner filed its answer to
respondent's complaint and, after due trial, on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="20" month="2"><span style="">February 20, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, said court rendered judgment the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which is of the following tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> In view of the
foregoing consi­derations, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff
and against the defendant ordering the latter to reinstate plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> to his former
position and to pay him his salary from the date of his separation from office
up to t<span style="">he </span>time
when he shall have been reinstated plus P15.00 as supplementary pay and
transporta­tion allowances of P12.50 a month also from the date of his
separation up to the time when he shall have been reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant is hereby ordered also to pay the
amount of P2,000.00 attorney's fees and costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, taken by petitioner, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of
Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and dismissed respondents'
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents seasonably moved
for a reconsideration, which was denied by the appellate court, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="6"><span style="">June 5,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, but,
seemingly, before receipt of notice of the resolution to this effect,
respondents filed, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="6"><span style="">June 11, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, an "Ad­ditional Petition in support"
of said motion for reconsidera­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This additional petition was followed, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="6"><span style="">June 15, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, by respondents' "Petition for New
Trial Based on the Ground of Newly Discovered Evidence." Despite
petitioner's opposi­tion thereto, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="9"><span style="">September 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of Appeals, after hearing both
parties on oral argument, issued the re­solution complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for review by certiorari
of petitioner herein, which maintains that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I - In Granting <span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> motion
for new trial based on nothing more than the affi­davit of his co-employee, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matro</span>, ex­ecuted under
suspicious circumstances <u><span style="">six </span></u><u><span style="">(6) </span>years
after</u> the occurrence of the facts alleged therein and only after the
judgment in <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> favor rendered by the trial court
was reversed on appeal by respondent court, which affidavit is not only
uncorroborated, <u>patently incredible</u>, based on hearsay and contains
merely collateral matters, but furthermore, cannot in any way produce a
different result on the merits of the trial even if accepted as true,
Respondent Court <span style="">not only </span>acted
with grave abuse of discretion but also contrary to law and the heretofore <span class="SpellE">unre­versed</span> rulings of this Honorable Court in U. S. <span style="">vs. </span>Luzon, 4 Phil. 343; U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Quijano</span>, 11 Phil. 368; <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> de

Phil. 994; People vs. Cu <span class="SpellE">Unjieng</span>, 61 Phil. 906,
establishing stringent and indispensable fundamental requirements for the
allowance of new trial based on newly dis­covered evidence;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">ll</span> - People vs. Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Saez</span>, G. R. No. L-15776, <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1961</st1:date>, invoked by respondent <span style="">Court </span>and upon which it relied in
granting respondent <span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> motion for new trial is
absolutely not applicable here;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III - The grant of <span class="SpellE">Salcedo's</span> motion
for new trial will cause prejudice to PAL and aggravate its contingent
liability, for not only will it unduly delay this case, but what is worse will
force PAL to incur additional expense and costs of litigation and in the remote
possibility that <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> is later conclusively
ordered re­instated with back wages will also correspond­ingly <u>increase the
back wages it may have to pay</u>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of its first
proposition, petitioner alleges:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>1)
<span style="">that respondents have not exercised
reasonable diligence in producing heretofore the new evidence they </span>now <span style="">seek to in­troduce; 2) that said new evidence
is unworthy of belief; and 3) that, apart from being corroborative, said
evidence can­not alter the result of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Proper consideration of
the reasons adduced by the peti­tioner in support of its first proposition
demands a brief review of the relevant facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their complaint herein </span><span style="">respondents
</span><span style="">pray for the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> as </span><span style="">petitioner's
</span><span style="">with back salary, as well as
damages and attorney's </span><span style="">fees,
upon </span><span style="">the ground that he had been
arbitrarily dismissed </span><span style="">by
petitione</span><span style="">r</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">herein
on June 28, 1957; that to justify its </span><span style="">action, petitioner subsequently </span><span style="">filed against him a false charge of </span><span style="">qualified theft, with </span><span style="">the
office of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Attorney, which, after </span><span style="">a protracted </span><span style="">investigation, covering a period of eight (8) months, </span><span style="">exonerated </span><span style="">him; that, </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">notwithstanding, petitioner had refused </span><span style="">either to </span><span style="">reinstate <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> or to give him a clearance,
the </span><span style="">absence of </span><span style="">which barred him from getting employment
elsewhere; </span><span style="">and that, </span><span style="">as a consequence, he was humiliated and <span class="SpellE">ostracised</span> </span><span style="">socially,
</span><span style="">apart from he and his family
suffering physical and </span><span style="">mental </span><span style="">anguish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner, in turn,
contended and endeavored to prove that <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> had
been dismissed for cause, because </span><span style="">he
had </span><span style="">stolen ball bearings
belonging to his employer and </span><span style="">conveyed
about </span><span style="">150 of said effects, for
P30, to one <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Abalajon</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">who, in turn, sold the
goods to the <span class="SpellE">Talastas</span> Diesel </span><span style="">Parts </span><span style="">Store, at Evangelista St., <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, Manila,
for P45 and that, subsequently, five (5) of these ball bearings were in fact
located in and recovered from said store by the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">For
this </span><span style="">purpose, petitioner had
introduced the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Abalajon</span>, in addition to
that of its employees, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> Cal­deron and Jesus <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to petitioner herein, it came to know, through </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cartagena</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, of the intervention of <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Abalajon</span>, in the sale of said allegedly stolen
goods, and later located the store in which some of those goods were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> denied the charge against him and asserted that the
same had been fabricated, the Court of Ap­peals did not believe his testimony
and gave credence to that of <span class="SpellE">Abalaj<span style="">on</span></span></span>,<span style=""> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cartagena</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and Calderon, and accordingly re­versed the
decision of the Court of First Instance in favor of </span><span style="">respondents herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notice of the decision of
the appellate court was re­ceived by respondents on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A week later, or on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="5"><span style="">May 15,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, they filed a
motion for reconsideration, which was denied on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="6"><span style="">June 5, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before notice of the resolution to this effect had been, apparently,
served upon them, </span><span style="">re­spondents
filed, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">11, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, an
Additional Petition </span><span style="">and </span>on
<st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1963</st1:date>, the petition
for new trial in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At­tached to
both petitions was the sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matro</span>, an employee of petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Matro</span> stated, in his affidavit, that
the ball-bearings found in the store of <span class="SpellE">Talastas</span>
Diesels Parts were purchased <span style="">by the
latter <u>from</u> <u>him</u>; that said ball-bearings were delivered to him by
<span class="SpellE"><u>Cartagena</u></span><u> </u>and <u>Calderon</u>; that
both persuaded </span>him to sell said articles and keep the proceeds thereof,
which he did; that, when he inquired from <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>
and Calderon about their reason for acting as they did, they told him that it
was <span style="">a </span>"military
secret;" that he, later on, learned that said goods were used to back up
the charge of theft against <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>; that he (<span class="SpellE">Matro</span>) did not volunteer to give this infor­mation before,
because he felt that it would jeopardize his job as petitioner's employee and
because he believed - or <span style="">hoped - that
respondents' counsel would be sufficiently able and resourceful to protect <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>; that, when the Court of Appeals reversed the
decision of the Court of First Instance in favor of respondents, he realized
that <span class="SpellE">Salcedo’s</span> fate was finally dependent upon his
civic spirit and moral courage; and that he, accordingly, approached
respondents' counsel and executed the aforementioned af­fidavit, despite the
risks <span class="SpellE">concommitant</span> therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe that respondents have been neg­ligent in
securing this evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had no
means of knowing it before <span class="SpellE">Matro</span>, allegedly pricked
by his con­science, had approached counsel for the respondents, soon after <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1963</st1:date>, when notice of the
resolution of the Court of Appeals, of <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="6">June
 5, 1963</st1:date> - denying respondents' motion for reconsideration of the
decision of said Court was served upon said counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Matro's</span> affidavit
was made on <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1963</st1:date>,
and the next day, respondent's "addi­tional petition," in support of
the motion for reconsidera­tion, was filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four (4) days later, or on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="6">June
 15, 1963</st1:date>, respondents filed a "petition for new trial based on
the ground of newly discovered evidence," referring to <span class="SpellE">Matro's</span>
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, this testimony is
newly discovered evidence and respondents were not negligent in securing the
same, in the light of the attending circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the question
whether Matrons affidavit is worthy of belief or not, it should be noted that
the question of </span><span style="">credibility of
witnesses is one of fact, the findings of the Court of Appeals on which are not
subject to our review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
particularly true when we consider that the contents of said affida­vit are not
inherently or necessarily incredible.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the sufficiency of Matrons testimony to change
the result of the case, suffice it to say that the deter­mination of the merits
thereof depends upon the question as to whose testimonial evidence merits
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Court be­lieves the
testimony of petitioner's witnesses, the vacated de­cision of the appellate
Court would be in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
resolution appealed from should be affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, we be­lieve, it must be <span style="">affirmed, since </span>we cannot review the findings
of said appellate court on the credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it is manifest to us that the Court of Ap­peals has
not abused its discretion in holding that <span class="SpellE">Matro’s</span> tes­timony,
if admitted in evidence, might change the final outcome of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, from the very beginning, <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> had pro­tested innocence and asserted that the
charge against him was fabricated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Without
corroboration</u>, his testimony thereon could hardly prevail over that of <span class="SpellE">Abalajon</span>, who claimed to have bought the ball-bearings from
<span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
with the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Matro</span>, to the effect that it
was <u>he</u> – <u>not</u> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> who made the <span style="">sale </span>to <span class="SpellE">Abalajon</span>, and that the ball-bear­ings had been given to <span class="SpellE">Matro</span> <u><span style="">by
Calderon and <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>it is quite conceivable that the
court may entertain serious doubts on the veracity of said witnesses for the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this juncture, we must
not lose sight of the fact that, even without <span class="SpellE">Matro</span>'
s testimony, the City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> felt that he
should not - as he did not - prosecute <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, any doubt on the general soundness of
the judgment of said prosecutor is dispelled by the fact that he was, in
effect, sustained by the Court of First Instance, which rendered judgment for
respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither should we
overlook the circumstance that the aforemention­ed prosecutor and His Honor the
trial Judge had personally heard the witnesses and observed them in the course
of their testimony, and, that, accordingly, their findings thereon are entitled
to great weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the factual
issue in this case appears to be precariously dependent upon the credibility of
the testimonial evidence for the peti­tioner contradicted by that of
respondents, both being, more or </span><span style="">less
so</span><span style=""> evenly<span style=""> balance</span> - <span style="">judging from
the action taken </span></span><span style="">thereon
by the three (3) sets of officers who have heretofore intervened in this case -
that anything could perhaps tip balance in favor of either side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In conclusion, we find
that the Court of Appeals had not only, not abused its discretion, but, also,
made good use of its sound judgment in acting as it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the question whether the case of
People v. <span class="SpellE">Saez</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> cited in the resolution appealed from is in
point or not, cannot af­fect the result of this proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said case is really in point
because it upheld the propriety of order­ing a new trial when the newly
discovered evidence may </span><span style="">af</span><span style="">fect the </span><u>credibility</u> <span style="">of the testimony of some witnesses for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, respondents herein
have a stronger claim for a new trial than the accused in the case above-men­tioned,
because the newly discovered evidence therein was an affidavit made by another,
<u>before</u> the prosecution of the ac­cused, whereas the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Matro</span> did not exist until <u>after</u> the rendition of the
decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
respondents herein could not have possibly learned, much less, availed of <span class="SpellE">Matro’s</span> affidavit prior thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither do the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">additional
expenses that a new trial would entail justify our disturbing the resolution
appealed from, it being </span><span style="">s</span><span style="">ettled that the granting or denial of a new
trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which used it properly in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, said resolution is here­by upheld and
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against petitioner herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
