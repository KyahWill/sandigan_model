				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petition herein purports to be an "appeal by
certiorari" from a resolution of the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was, at first, denied; but, on
motion for reconsideration, the Court granted the same, required the
respondents to answer said petition - which was regarded as one for certiorari,
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, to expedite the disposal of the case, in
view of the public interest involved therein - and issued a temporary
restraining order, effective immediately and until further orders from the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents filed their
respective, answers, to which Petitioner replied, after which the parties were
heard on oral argument, and then filed their respective memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rasid</span> <span class="SpellE">Lucman</span>
- hereinafter referred to as Petitioner - was the official Liberal Party
candidate for the House of Representatives in the lone congressional district
of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, during
the general elections held on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November
 11, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macacuna</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span> - hereinafter
referred to as Respondent - was then the official <span class="SpellE">Nacion­alista</span>
Party candidate for the same office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 14, 1969, Petitioner filed with the Commission on
Elections a petition alleging that the precinct books of voters for the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, had been stolen on the eve of the elections,
for which reason the Special Action Team of the Commission in said province had
urged the Commission to recommend to the President the suspension of the
elections in <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, and that, although no elections
had been held therein, there were election returns <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
which, accordingly, are fic­titious or obviously manufactured, and praying that
the provincial board of canvassers - hereinafter referred to as the Board - be
ordered to suspend the canvass of said returns, as well as the proclamation of
the winning candidate for the House of Represen­tatives in <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon said petition, the Commission, in a resolution, dated
<st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1969</st1:date>, ordered
the Board to refrain from canvass­ing the aforementioned election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resolution was, however, amended by
another, of November 21, 1969, directing the Board to proceed with the canvass
of all the returns for <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>
and requiring the parties to interpose their objections before said Board,
which should, however, withhold the proclamation of the winning candidate, to
enable said parties to elevate the matter, either to the Commission, or to the
courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Board met at Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, on Novem­ber 25, 1969, and began the canvass,
Petitioner moved, in writing, for the exclusion <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
of the returns for all of the sixteen (16) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>
and the twenty-nine (29) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Balaba­gan</span>, as
well as those of two (2) precincts (Nos. 6 and 8) of <span class="SpellE">Balin­dong</span>,
two (2) (Precincts Nos. 8 and 11) of <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span>, and
one (1) (Precinct No. 18) of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the canvass, Petition­er objected,
moreover, to the inclusion in the canvass of a number of other returns. On
November 29, he filed a supplemental petition for the exclusion of the returns,
not only for the precincts mentioned in the original petition, but, also, for
additional precincts - name­ly, two (2) (Precincts Nos. 7-A and 8) of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Grande, fourteen (14) (Precincts Nos. 1, 1-A, 2,
2-A, 3, 3-A, 4, 4-A, 5, 5-A, 9, 10, 11-A and 11-B) of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>,
eleven (11) (Precincts Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9-A and 10) of <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span>, three (3) (Precincts Nos. 6, 7 and 9) of <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span>, one (1) (Precinct No. 8) of <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>,
and two (2) (Precincts Nos. 2-A and 5) of <span class="SpellE">Pualas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said petitions for exclusion were soon denied by the Board, in
view of which Petitioner sought, on <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="12">December
 6, 1969</st1:date>, a review of its action by the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 12, 1969, the latter held that the rule laid down in <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> v. Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
authorizing the exclusion of returns, upon the ground of statistical
improbability, where 100% of the number of voters registered or votes cat are
credited exclusively to all the candidates of one political party, without a
single vote for any of the other candidates is in applicable to the returns
contested by the Petitioner, and, consequently; sustained the action of the
Board fn rejecting his objection, upon the ground of statistical improbability
to the returns for the following precincts, to wit:</p>

existence of a serviceable (copy) of said returns. The Commission also ordered
the re­view of the returns for Precinct No. 9, <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>,

signed by the members of the Board of Inspectors and, therefore, not a properly

</span>It summoned the election registrar of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>
to testify before the Commission, and denied Petitioner's motion for the
opening of the ballot boxes of said municipality, upon the ground that the reasons
adduced in support thereof are proper for an election protest, as well as
directed the Board to reject the return for Precinct No. 9 of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, the same not being signed by the members of its
board of inspectors, arid reset the case for hearing on January 6, 1970,
"to give the parties opportunity to elevate any of the above rulings to

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In a minute resolution of
this Court, dated <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1970</st1:date>,
said petition in G.R. No. L-31430 was, however, dismissed for "lack of
merit." A motion for reconsideration of said resolution, or, at least,
modification thereof - so as to state that the dismissal was due, not to
"lack of merit," but to its "being premature" was denied on
January 14, 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior thereto, or on January 5, 1970, Petitioner had filed a
second supplemental petition asking that "in addition to the prayer in the
Supplemental petition for review x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the true votes in Precincts <span style="">10 </span>and 10-A of <span class="SpellE">Bayang</span>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Precincts 8 and 9-C of <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>, Precincts 8 and 9-A of <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span>
and Precincts 10 and 11 of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">B</span>alindong</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> be entered in the canvass in lieu of the tam­pered votes
thereof." Inasmuch as the aforementioned petitions for exclusion were
based upon several grounds - namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
sta­tistical improbability; (2) formal defects and <span style="">other irregularities in </span>the preparation of the returns; (3)
tampering thereof; (4) falsity of the returns, there having allegedly been no
election; and (5) returns prepared at gunpoint - the Commission decided to
dispose of the same by process of elimination.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 13, the Commission opened the ballot boxes of all
precincts of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span> and found no ballots in five (5)
of them - Precincts Nos. 3, 6, 7, 12 and 12-A - although Respondent main­tains,
as regards Precincts Nos. 3, 6 and 7, that the Commission had merely refused to
open any of the envelopes found in the ballot boxes thereof - because none of
said envelopes <span style="">bore, outside </span>thereof,
an inscription to the effect that they contain "counted ballots" -
despite his request that the envelopes be opened be­cause there may be ballots
inside the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission,
likewise, approved a supplemental report, submitted by the afore­mentioned
Committee, reiterating the findings in its original report of December 20,
1969, and ruled that the defects pointed out by the Petitioner did not affect the
integrity of, <span style="">or overcome </span>the
presumption of regularity with respect to, the returns for Precincts Nos. 8, 13
and 14<span style=""> </span>of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>,
8 of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Balindong</span></span><span style="">, and </span>9 and 14 of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>.
</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, Petitioner invited attention to the fact that,
in canvassing the votes for Senators, the Commission had rejected, on December
2, 1969, upon the ground of being obviously manufactured, the returns for
Precincts Nos. 3, 4-B and 15 of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> and 3 of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, and set aside, owing to patent irregularities in
their preparation, the returns for Precincts Nos. 9 and 11 of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1970</st1:date>,
the Commission rejected Petitioner's objection to these returns, except as
regards that for Precinct 11-B of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, with
respect to which, it resolved "to examine the Provincial Treasurer's copy
and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> copy of said return."</p>

<p class="BODY">In a separate resolution of the same date, the Commission:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) approved <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>
the Committee's supplemental report; (2) ruled that the returns for Precincts

have no fatal defects; (3) ordered the opening of the ballot boxes of Precincts
Nos. 7-A and 8 of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Grande, 11 of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> and 6 and 9-A of <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span>,
for examination of the returns contained therein; (4) sustained the action of
the Board in including in its canvass the provincial trea­surer's copy of the
return for Precinct No. 11-B of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>; (5) held,
upon examination of the copies of the Commission and the provincial treasurer
of the return for Precinct No. 10 of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span> had obtained therein 246 votes, without prejudice
to a judicial re­count if the result would be affected; (6) found, upon
examination of the provincial treasurer's copy of the return for Precinct 11 of
<span class="SpellE">Balin­dong</span>, that there is a misalignment of the
number of votes therein recorded, and, accordingly, ordered the use of the copy
of the Commission, pursuant to which <span class="SpellE">Lucman</span> had
obtained 15 votes, <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span> 225, and independent
candidate <span class="SpellE">Liningding</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangandaman</span>

thereof, of the provincial treasurer's copy; (8) directed the use of the
Commission's copy of the returns for Precincts Nos. 8 and 9-C of <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>; (9) ordered that the ballot box copies of the
returns for Precincts Nos. 7-A and 8 of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Grande
be used in the canvass; and (10) as to Precincts Nos. 6 and 9-A of <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span>, it decided, as to the former, to "restore

the use of the provincial treasurer's copy of the return.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to other objections made by the parties, the
Commission decided to defer the resolution thereof until the com­pletion of the

20, 1970, their formal offer of documentary evidence or exhibits, as well as to
give them until January 22, 1970 to file, simultaneously, their respective
memoranda, and declared that the case would be deemed submitted for decision

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1970</st1:date>,
the Commission issued its appealed resolution, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

from Precincts Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 is hereby
sustained;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reject the returns from Precincts Nos. 3,
6, 7, 12 and 12-A <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, it appearing that the
ballot boxes for said precincts are empty and, therefore, the returns prepared
for said pre­cincts are fictitious or false and to direct the Board of
Canvassers to exclude from the canvass the returns from said precincts;</blockquote>

his claim that there was no voting in twenty-eight (28) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>; that the LP inspectors of said precincts were
excluded in the canvass and/or forced to sign the returns at gunpoint; and/or
that said returns have been prepared and signed by persons other than the
members of the Board of Inspectors and to sustain the actions of the Board with
respect to said re­turns, except with respect to Precinct No. 6<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where
the Board is directed to ascertain the exist­ence of a serviceable copy of the

ballot box copy, unless the parties jointly manifest to waive the canvass of
this precinct since the outcome of the election is not affected by the result
from this precinct or there was really a failure of election in this precinct;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(4) <span style=""> </span>To hold that the Commission has no jurisdiction
to nullify the results of the election of Precinct No. 5-A, <span class="SpellE">Madalum</span>,
where petitioner alleged that election took place on November 12, 1969 instead
of November 11, 1969, such question being one within the jurisdiction of the
House of Electoral Tribunal;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

petitioner to substantiate his claim that the returns for Precinct No. 18, <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span>, Precincts Nos. 8, 9, 9-A, 10 and 11, <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span> and Precincts Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9, <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> have been prepared at gunpoint or that the LP
inspectors therein have been illegally substituted or forced to sign the return
are inconclusive to overcome the presumption of regularity in the pre­paration
of said returns or in favor of their valid­ity, especially where there is also
evidence sub­mitted by respondent to fortify said presumption and to hold
further that the alleged irregularities committed in these precincts are
corrupt election practices and anomalies more appropriately sub­ject of
election protests;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Briefly stated, Petitioner herein seeks the exclusion from the
canvass of the returns for the following:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>14 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>28 precincts (all except Precinct No. 6) of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span></blockquote>

of <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>5 precincts (Precincts Nos. 8, 9, 9-A, 10 and
11) of <span class="SpellE">Binidayan</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1 precinct (Precinct No. 18) of <span class="SpellE">Lumba-Bayabao</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1 precinct (Precinct No. 5-A) of <span class="SpellE">Madalum</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By reason of the grounds upon which they are contested, said returns
may be divided into four (4) groups, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) those of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, which are objected to
upon the theory that no elections had been held in said municipality; (2) those
of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>, which are assailed as having been made
without counting the ballots or votes cast; (3) those of the four (4) other
municipalities, in addition <span style="">to </span>the
returns for three (3) precincts (Nos. 8, 13 and 14) of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>
and two (2) (Precincts Nos. 9 and 14) of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>,
which are impugned upon several grounds; and (4) those of three (3) precincts
of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>, which had been excluded, in the canvass
for Senators, as being obviously manufactured.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, Petitioner
maintains that no elec­tions were held therein because the precinct books of
voters of said municipality had been stolen on the eve of election day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention was sustained by the
Commission as regards only five (5) precincts (Precincts Nos. 3, 6, 7, 12 and
12-A) of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, no ballots having been found inside
its ballot boxes when the same were opened before the Commission, on <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respon­dent alleges that this finding is
inaccurate, insofar as Precincts Nos. 3, 6 and 7 are concerned, because the
Commission had merely found in its ballot boxes no envelope with an inscription
to the ef­fect that it is "for counted ballots, " and denied his
request that the envelopes contained in said boxes be opened, for the reason
that there might be used ballots therein, notwithstanding the absence of the
aforementioned inscription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not propose,
however, to pass upon the question thus raised by Respondent, the same being
one of fact which is not proper in the proceedings before Us, whether the same
be regarded s an original action for certiorari or as an appeal by certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in special civil actions for
certiorari, the main issue is one of jurisdiction - lack of jurisdiction or
grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> whereas petitions for review on certiorari are
limited to the con­sideration of questions of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner asserts that the Commission has erred in sanc­tioning
the inclusion, in the canvass, of the returns for-Precincts Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 8,
9, 10,13, 14 and 16 of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, despite his claim
that no elections had been held therein, which the Commis­sion found he had
failed to substantiate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question whether or not there had been elections or not in
said precincts is manifestly one of fact and, in view of the last paragraph of
section 9 of Commonwealth Act No. 657, which is identical to that of Section 5
of the present Revised Election Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Any decision, order or ruling of the Commission on Elections
may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari in accordance with
the Rules of Court or with such rules as may be promulgated by the Supreme
Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the majority opinion, in Sotto v.
Commission on Elections<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> stated
that "this Court can <u>not</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> review the rulings or findings of fact of the Commission
on Elections."</p>

<p class="BODY">It Is true that such pronouncement was not concurred in by
several members of this court who were inclined to believe that its
constitutional power of review of decisions, orders or rulings of the
Commission is absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not share,
however, such belief for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
Constitution uses the term "review," not "appeal," and
these terms have different connotations in our jurisdiction; (2) Congress is
deemed to retain its general power to define the manner in which the Supreme
Court shall exercise its power of re­view, in the absence of clear and specific
provision to the con­trary, and no such provision exists; (3) pursuant to our
Adminis­trative Law, the findings of fact of administrative organs create by
ordinary legislation will not be disturbed by courts of justice, except when
there is absolutely no evidence or no substantial evidence in support of such
findings,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> and there is no reason to
believe that the framers of our Constitution intended to place the Commission
on Elections - created and explicitly made "independent" by the
Constitution itself - on a lower level that said statutory administrative
organs; and (4) the aforementioned provi­sion of the Election Law is presumed
to be valid until otherwise declared by competent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, in addition to the admitted fact that all pre­cinct
books of voters for <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span> had disappeared on the
eve of election, the evidence for the Petitioner consisted of affidavits of the
LP election inspectors in <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, the Chairmen and
Poll Clerks of some precincts therein, the LP Chairman and local leader of the
Petitioner, and a few registered voters, aside from a message of the Special
Action Team of the Commission in <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> suggesting that the Commission recommend to the
President the suspension of the elections in <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>,
owing to the disappearance of said books of voters.</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over the record, We are satisfied that the find­ing
of the Commission to the effect that elections had been held in Precincts Nos.
1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>,
is supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ballots were found inside the ballot boxes of
said precincts;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>
testified that, owing to the disappearance of the books of voters and to the
fact that the Election Registrar was unavailable on election day, he (the
municipal treasurer) had caused the precinct lists of voters and copies of CE
Form No. 39 to be furnished each precinct by forcing open the cabinets, in the
office of the Election Registrar, in which said documents were kept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner assails the credibility of said
testimony, but such matter is beyond our power of review in the present case,
apart from the fact that the Commission, before which the testimony had been
given, was in a better position that We are to pass upon <span style="">it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contested finding of the Commission is,
also, borne out by the aforementioned message of its Special Action Team, which
reported that the "MUNICIPAL TREASURER X <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span> FORCIBLY OPENED CABINETS OFFICE ELEC REGISTRAR WHERE
PRECINCT LIST VOTERS KEPT AND DISTRIBUTED SAME TO BOARDS ELEC INSPECTORS X <span class="SpellE">X</span> X."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further corroboration is supplied by the
returns for the 11 precincts aforementioned.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, Respondent submitted affidavits of
the chair­men, poll clerks and NP inspectors of said precincts, contradicting
the affidavits submitted by Petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter insists that said affidavits filed by Respondent should not
be entertained, he (Peti­tioner) having objected thereto as hearsay evidence,
for he had no opportunity to cross-examine the affiants, despite his request
that they be summoned <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, which was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even, however, without said
affidavits for Respondent, the disputed finding of the Commission would, still
be supported by substantial evidence, and, hence, should not be disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to twenty-eight (28) precincts of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>, Petitioner alleges that the election returns <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were "prepared at the Municipal Hall of said
municipality, where the ballot boxes were forcibly brought, without opening
said ballot boxes, and without counting the votes cast, with the LP inspectors
excluded in the pre­paration of said election returns at gunpoint, or, in some,
were coerced to sign the election returns at gunpoint."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To substantiate this allegation, Petitioner introduced the affidavits
of a number of LP inspectors and CNEA watchers, two (2) members of the PC and
some 12 leaders in <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>
countered, however, with affidavits of practically all of the chairmen, poll
clerks and NP inspectors, as well as of some LP inspectors. Moreover, the
testimony of the Election Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>, who
was summoned by the Commission, bore out the theory of Respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Passing upon Petitioner's objections to the
aforementioned returns, the Commission had the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of this conflict in the sworn statements of the
witnesses of petitioner and respondent, the Commission decided to summon Abdul <span class="SpellE">Marahom­salic</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified before the Commission denying
the imputation of petitioner and his witnesses that he, together with the
mayor, had ordered the Board of Inspectors to bring the ballot boxes to the
Municipal Building where the Board of Inspectors were ordered to pre­pare the
returns without opening the ballot boxes to read or canvass the votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He </u><u><span style="">was subjected to lengthy examination by the Members of </span>the
Commis­</u><u><span style="">sion and grueling cross
examination by counsel for the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After hearing the testimony of </span>said </u><u><span style="">registrar and observing closely his demeanor </span>and
</u><u><span style="">manner of testifying at the
witness </span>stand </u><u><span style="">mission is
inclined to believe his testimony and that there</span> is no truth </u><u><span style="">to the charge</span></u><span style=""> </span>that he and the mayor had ordered the
preparation of the returns without the canvassing of the votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In any event, the very nature of canvass proceedings which
the Supreme Court in its recent decision in the ILARDE vs. TAMANO case has
again emphasized to be merely summary would not require the Commission to go
beyond the need of determin­ing a <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this fact, the Commission believes
that the presumption of regu­larity, which in this case is supported by the
sworn statements of the chairmen and poll clerks in this disputed precincts of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> and of the election registrar not to mention
those of the NP inspectors and in some precincts LP inspectors, has not been
overcome by the sworn statements of the witnesses of petitioner x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner impugns the foregoing conclusion upon the ground
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the affidavits for Respondent
are inadmissible as <span class="SpellE">hearsy</span> evidence, because the
affiants could not be cross-examined, the Commission having refused to summon
them, despite timely motions filed by Petitioner; (2) the testimony of the
election registrar is unworthy of credence; (3) the affidavits for the Petitioner
include those of some members of the PC and CNEA watchers, which are supported
by the report of the Special Action Team of the Commis­sion, and, hence, should
be accorded much weight; (4) the pre­sumption of regularity is inapplicable to
the case at bar; and (5) the returns for Precincts Nos. 3, 4-B and 15 of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> had been excluded by the Commission in its
canvass of the returns for senators, as obviously manufactured.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first ground relied
upon by Petitioner is untenable, for:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the Commission had
indicated its intention to determine the case on the basis of the affidavits
and the documentary evidence introduced by the, parties and that it was with
such understanding that Respondent filed affidavits in his favor and did not
object to those made for Petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's objection would be plausible, if
the Commis­sion were a court of justice or could determine and settle with
final­ity the issue, of fact raised in connection with the returns for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission has no such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when, upon denial of Petitioner's
motions for the issuance of <span class="SpellE">subpoenae</span> to the affiants
for Respondent herein, Petitioner insti­tuted Case No. L-31430 of this Court -
to compel the Commission, by mandamus, to, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
issue the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">subpoenae</span> -We forthwith
dismissed the petition therein and, soon thereafter, denied petitioner's motion
for reconsideration of our resolution of dismissal of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, in connection with
the canvass of the returns for the office of member of the House of
Representatives for <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,

corresponding election pro­test, if any. So long as the election returns have
been accomplished in due form, the Board, and, on appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
the Com­mission, must include said returns in the canvass.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> v. Comelec<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> presented a peculiar situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) sets of returns were involved
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first set, "in each
precinct the number of registered voters <span class="SpellE">equalled</span> the
number of ballots and the number of votes reportedly cast and tallied <u>for,
each and every</u>, candidate of the Liberal Party, the party in power;
whereas, all the candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party
got <u>exactly</u> <u>zero</u>; and in the second set x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> all the reported votes were for candidates of the
Liberal Party, all of whom were credited with <u>exactly the same</u> number of
votes in each precinct; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
whereas, all the candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party
were given <u>exactly zero</u> in all said precincts. " As a consequence,
this Court held that said returns were "<u>obviously</u>
manufactured" “contrary to all statistical probabilities," "<u>utterly</u>
improbable and <u>clearly</u> incredible." It should be noted that this
was not strictly an issue of fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the main elements essential to its determination appeared <u>on
the face of</u> <u>the returns themselves</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, there was <u>no dispute</u> as regards such
elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispute boiled down to the
proper conclusion to be drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and, hence,
it partook of the nature of a question of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> What is
more, <span style="">in </span>the view of this Court,
that conclusion was <u>clear</u>, <u>obvious</u>, <u>manifest</u>, and <u>indubitable</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such is not the situation obtaining in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The irregularity pointed out by the
Petitioner is denied by Respondent, thereby raising a purely factual
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of settling the same,
the affidavits submitted by both parties merely stressed the contentious nature
of the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the same could
not have been wiped out or even minimized by the presence and cross-examination
of the affiants for Respondent, had they appeared be­fore the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, unlike the condition of the
returns involved in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case - which this
Court consi­dered <u>incontestable</u> that existing as regards the returns for
<span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> is clearly a <u>very controversial one</u>,
which the Commission has no power to decide with finality.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(d)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The
Commission could not, moreover, summon the affiants for Respondent, without
granting him the same right to examine the <span class="SpellE">the</span>
affiants for Petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would have
entailed a full-dress elu<span style="">cidation of
the aforementioned issue of fact, which, after all, the Commission cannot
settle authoritatively. Worse still, it would create </span>a <span style="">situation fraught with possibilities,
inimical to the spirit of the laws establishing boards of canvassers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled that the same are meant, not only to <span style="">charge purely </span><u>ministerial</u> <span style="">duties, based upon returns submitted thereto
in due form, but, also, to perform this function </span><u>summarily</u>, <span style="">so that winning candidates could assume their
office on the date set for the commencement of their term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main role of the Commission in connection
therewith is to see to it that such objective be carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory advanced by petitioner herein
would, however, induce the candidates who are likely to lose, on the basis of
said returns, to raise questions of fact requiring the introduction of
testimonial evidence thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
sustained, its effect would be to delay, far beyond the time envisaged by law,
the proclamation of the winning candidates and their assumption of office,
thereby de­priving the people, in the meanwhile, of the representation they are
entitled to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, there would be an
unnecessary duplication of the proceedings peculiar to election protests, with
the consequent possibility of having different results and the serious dangers
con­comitant therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contested resolution of the Commission was
issued <u>on appeal</u> from the action of the Board in denying the petitions
for exclusion filed by petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, petitioner could not legally raise before the Commission, in the
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, any question not originally set up
before said Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The propriety of
considering affidavits when its makers have not been made available for cross-examination
was never put in issue before said Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, Petitioner had no right to do so on appeal taken to the
Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of credibility of the testimony given by the election
registrar of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span> cannot, for the reasons
already adverted to, be entertained in the present proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the CNEA watchers, the Commission had the following to
say:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the Commission well remembers that in organizing the CNEA for <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, the Chairman and
two Members of the Commission who went to <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City
last September 1969, were faced with the difficulty of looking for impartial
and non-partisan CNEA representatives for as they were then informed in <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> one is either a
rabid partisan or follower of the <span class="SpellE">DIMAPORO's</span> or of
the <span class="SpellE">LUCMAN's</span> and <span class="SpellE">ALONTO's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is possible that all
witnesses whose sworn statements have been submitted to the Commission are
partisans of the one or the other. xxx ."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find nothing in the record to justify our disturbing the
foregoing view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the
same is bolstered up by the fact that most of the affidavits belonging to each
set follow, <u>mutatis</u> <u>mutandis</u>, an identical pattern, as to both
the substance of its contents and the language thereof. </p>

<p class="BODY">Then again the report of the Special Action Team of. the
Commission referred to two (2) precincts only of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>
- Pre­cincts 9 and 9-A and merely expressed an opinion, based; not upon
personal knowledge, but upon the affidavits of an enlisted man and a
lieutenant, both of the PC, made 9 and 15 days, respectively, after the
elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being limited to two (2)
precincts of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>, said report can not affect
the other precincts thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it
can not prevail, over the contested resolution of the Commission or prove that
the latter is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission
had conducted more extensive investigations, as well as received and considered
much more evidence than said Team.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>In support of the theory that
Respondent may not avail of the presumption of regularity, Petitioner quotes
from Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span> <span class="SpellE">Secundum</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>"The presumption cannot be indulged to the extent of supplying
the necessary authority for an act, or to sustain official action where the man­datory
requirements of a statute concerning such action are wholly disregarded.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This </span>argument as<span style="">sumes, however, that the mandatory provi­sions
of the Election Law have not been 'complied with in connection with the returns
for <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>; but, this is merely Petitioner's con­tention,
which, at best, is debatable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
party asserting that irregularities had been committed in the preparation of
said returns, Petitioner had the burden of proving the same and of offsetting
the presumption of regularity established by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As heretofore adverted to, he, however,
failed in both.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Let us now consider the
returns for precincts Nos. 3, 4-B and 15 of <span class="SpellE">Balabagan</span>,
which had been excluded by the Commission from its canvass of the returns for
senators, upon the ground that they were obviously manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion was based upon the fact that
100% of the votes cast in said precincts were credited to every one of the
candidates for <u>senator</u> belonging to only <u>one</u> political
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that the
candidates for the House of Representatives <u>were credited in said returns
"with a few votes</u>." Obviously, the entries with respect to these
candidates for the House of Representatives do not come within the purview of
the rule laid down in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case and are not
obviously ma­nufactured. In fact; We had previously ruled that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We agree with the respondents that the second and third
grounds (supra) advanced by petition­ers to force rejection by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> of the contested returns are untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while the Commission in its role as
senatorial canvasser had the power to re­ject returns before it that in its
opinion was illegal or not authentic, neither law nor precedent authorize it to
impose the same criterion in <u>advance</u> upon the provincial boards of
canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter are certainly
entitled to use their own judgment in deter­mining whether the irregularities
appearing on returns before them warrant their rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must not be forgotten that the copies of
the returns upon which the provincial canvassers act are different from those in
the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, and the irregular­ities
noted in the latter may not necessarily exist <span style="">in the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should there be
any discrepancy bet­ween the official copies, the petitioners can recourse to a
judicial recount under section 163 of the Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But certainly, an <u>a</u> <u>priori</u>
rejection on the basis of previous <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> action is
not justifiable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains, also, that there were other irregular­ities
in the preparation of the returns for the following precincts, or that there
are defects therein, warranting the exclusion thereof from the canvass:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precincts Nos. 8, 13 and 14 of <span class="SpellE">Tubaran</span>, involving alto­gether 193 votes for Respondent and

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that the tentative result of the
canvass conducted by the Board gave Respondent a total of 46,326 votes,
Petitioner 41,157 votes and independent candidate <span class="SpellE">Pangan­daman</span>
7,875 votes, or a plurality of 5,169 votes in favor of Respon­dent, over his
closest opponent, Petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, the aggregate plurality of Respondent in the
precincts above mentioned is 2,884 votes, which, added to his plurality of 371

5,169 tentatively found by the Board in favor of Respondent, he would still
have a plurality of 1,914 votes to his credit.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I concur with the
decision penned by Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, but
in connection with the statement made at page 15 thereof to the effect that
"The functions of its Provincial Board of Canvassers is purely ministerial
in nature.", and that other statement appearing in the same page to this
effect: "Equally ministerial, therefore, is the function of the
Commission, in the exercise of its supervisory power over said Board, pursuant
to our Consti­tution and laws", I wish to state briefly my own view of the
true nature and scope of the powers of Boards of Can­vassers and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, under our Electoral Code and juris</span>prudence,
in connection with <span style="">the matter </span>to
which the quoted statements refer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party <span style="">vs. </span>Commission on Elections, We said

upheld, upon the facts therein obtaining, the authority of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to reject given election returns submitted to it for the purpose of the
required canvass, <span style="">if in its </span>opinion,
they were "obviously manufactured" or "contrary to all
statistical probabilities", or "utterly improbable and clearly
incredible".</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, I believe, that when in <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <span style="">We
</span>said that the canvassers are to be satisfied of the genuineness of the
returns, We recognized their authority <span style="">to
</span>determine - and this inevitably implies the exercise of judgment or
discretion, however limited whether any given return before them is <u>genuine</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, what is meant by <u>genuine</u>? <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The true meaning of the term, I submit, is
that the document speaks the truth; that it is what it purports to be - a
faithful statement or record of the truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In reality, "genuine" and "authentic" - which are
considered synonymous - mean <u>trustworthy</u> or <u>not false</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when a given document is said to be
genuine or authentic, it is meant that it is fully trustworthy and is in <span style="">accordance </span>with fact or actuality
(Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, p. 59).</p>

<p class="BODY">From all the foregoing l draw the conclusion that, if <span style="">in </span>the opinion of a Board of
Canvassers a particular return before it does not speak the truth or is false
in any material respect; that it is not fully trustworthy or is not in
accordance with fact or actuality, it may reject it in <span style="">the </span>exercise of the discretion We have recognized it <span style="">possesses; </span>otherwise stated, it may
declare that it is not "satisfied of the genuineness" of the
document.</p>
