The <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. (here­inafter
referred to as the Central) is the owner and operator of the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Marcia sugar mill, has operated the same since the
1920-1921 crop year, and manufactures sugar from sugar cane planted and grown
by sugar cane planters in the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia mill dis­trict
and surrounding areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Marcia Sugar Farmers Corporation (hereinafter
referred to as the Planters) represents about 350 sugar planters-members, with
an annual production of over 700,000 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of sugar,
and a total acreage of about 10,000 hec­tares of land planted to sugar cane.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1920 the Central entered into identical printed milling
contracts with the adherent planters in the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia
mill dis­trict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1936 these milling
contracts were superseded by identical printed amended milling contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the signatories were the
predecessors-in-interest of the Landowners, then owners of the <u>hacienda</u> <st1:place>Helvetia</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central undertook to construct, maintain and operate a wharf
(which the adherent planters could use for the shipment of their sugar or the
unloading of materials needed by them), and rail­road lines for the
transportation of sugar cane from the plantations to the central mill site,
these obligations being imposed by paragraphs 3 and 5 (of the milling
contracts) which provide:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early 1920s the Central constructed railroad tracks on the
lands of the adherent planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
trunk thereof traversed the <u>hacienda</u> <st1:place>Helvetia</st1:place>,
occupying at least 3,245 lineal meters with a width of 7 meters, or a total of
22,715 square meters, more or less.</p>

<p class="BODY">When their 1936 printed amended milling contracts expired at the
end of the 1964-1965 crop year, the Landowners required the Central to remove
the railway tracks in the <u>hacienda</u> and threatened to deny passage to its
cane cars.</p>

<p class="BODY">In September of 1965 the Central filed a complaint with the
respondent Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental (CC 7697) against the Landowners, praying that an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> writ of preliminary injunction issue restraining
the latter “from removing and/or destroying the railroad tracks in question and
from impeding, obstructing or in anyway preventing the passage and operation of
plain­tiff's locomotives and <span class="SpellE">canecars</span> over
defendants' property during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
litigation," and that, after a hearing on the merits, the Central be
awarded "a legal easement of the right of way" over the <u>hacienda</u>
Helvetia, plus costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Planters
became a party to the suit as complainant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central took the position that it has acquired a legal
easement on the <u>hacienda</u> through 45 years of continuous use of the
railroad tracks under the aforesaid milling contracts and by virtue of article
649 of the Civil Code; that the <u>hacienda</u> completely surrounds the mill
site on the eastern side where the railroad tracks enter the sugar central;
that the continuous use of the railroad tracks is "absolutely
indispensable" for hauling cane from the adherent plantations to the
central, for the transportation of export and domestic sugar from the mill site
to the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Niño</span> dock for
ship­ment, and for the transportation of materials and fertilizers from said
dock to the central; that there is no other place through which the railroad
lines could reach the sugar central, except the indica­ted portions of the <u>hacienda</u>;
that the destruction and/ or removal of the railroad tracks in the <u>hacienda</u>
would paralyze the operations of the Central and cause irreparable damage to
it, the adherent planters, the sugar industry, and the national economy as a
whole; and that the Landowners will not suffer any damage if the railroad
tracks were allowed to remain in their <u>hacienda</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Landowners (Fernando F. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>,
Inc. became a party to the action as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>-defendant)
opposed the permanent establishment of the railroad tracks in their <u>hacienda</u>
as well as the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, averring that the
1936 milling contract their predecessors-in-interest had entered into with the
Central has ceased to have effect, its term having expired at the end of the
1064-1965 crop year; that although under article 849 of the Civil Code, an
"owner, or any person who by virtue of a real right may cultivate or use
any immovable, which is surrounded by other <span class="SpellE">immovables</span>
pertaining to other persons and without adequate outlet to a public highway, is
entitled to demand a right of way through the neighboring estates, after
payment of the proper indemnity," the Central waived this right when, in
the afore­said contract, it stipulated that the existence of the railroad
tracks would be coterminous with the life of the contract; that the railroad
tracks are neither necessary nor indispensable to the Central's operations,
pointing out in this connection that at least two other sugar centrals in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental employ trucks and truck-trailers in
transporting cane from plantations to mill sites, and the Central, in fact,
during the 1964-1965 crop year, utilized such means of transportation in
hauling cane from adherent plantations to its sugar mill; that the continued
existence of the railroad tracks in their <u>hacienda</u> unduly prevents them,
particularly the Fernando <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, Inc., from
utilizing the <u>hacienda</u> and makes it impossible for them to develop
certain portions thereof into a real estate subdivision; and that their rights
to the uninterrupted and exclusive use and enjoyment of their <u>hacienda</u>
are far superior to the Central's claim of easement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 4, 1965 the respondent court issued the writ of
preliminary injunction prayed for by the Central, and maintained the same in
its two subsequent orders of May 31 and <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It justified the writ by stating that “the continuance of the acts
complained of during the litigation would work injustice to the plaintiff, and
that great or irreparable loss and damage would re­sult to the plaintiff before
the matter can be heard on notice.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present recourse by the Landowners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ask this Court to restrain the
respondent court from enforcing the writ of preliminary injunction, and pray
that after a hearing on the me­rits, the restraining order be made permanent
and the orders complained of be annulled and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">By resolution of January 25, 1967, we gave due course to the
petition, and, on August 10, 1967, issued a writ of preliminary injunction
enjoining the respondent court from enforcing the writ of preliminary
injunction issued by it on October 4, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 12, 1967, acting upon a manifestation and motion that
"through the mediation of the President of the Philippines, the parties
herein have agreed, subject to this Court's approval, that the petitioners
shall permit during the 1967-68 milling season only, the use of the railroad
tracks passing through petitioners' properties for the same purpose for which
they have been previously used, it being understood that this shall be without
prejudice to the respective rights and positions of the parties herein and
shall not be deemed a waiver of any of their respective claims and alle­gations
either in the instant case or in Civil Case No. 7697 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental or in any other case
between the same parties, future or pending," this Court resolved to
approve the motion, and "as prayed for by the parties, the writ of
preliminary injunction issued by this Court is temporarily lifted up to and
including June 30, 1968, to give effect to this agreement, and shall be deemed
automatically reinstated beginning July 1, 1968."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1968</st1:date>
the Central filed a motion to admit supplemental memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to it as part thereof is a copy of
the amended complaint it filed with the respondent court, which pre­sents
several "new issues." The first six, relied upon by the Central to
sustain the writ of injunction issued by the respondent court, are quoted
hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That under Sec. 7, Act 2479, the mill­ing
contracts that should be executed between the PLANTERS and the CENTRAL should
'convey to the Central such right of way as the Central may deem necessary for
roads and railroad connecting the mill with the fields’ which provision of law
must be read into the said contract, and since a conveyance of a railroad right
of way is not only an easement, but is a conveyance in fee simple of the strip
of land covered thereby, then the provision of the milling contracts limiting
the existence of the said right of way to 45 crop years or harvests is null and
void, as being in conflict with the law and public policy, and since the Cen­tral
is the owner of the said railroad right of way, then, it may not be prevented
from using the same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>
that there is no conveyance in fee simple of the strip of land over the right
of way, and the limitation of 45 crop years or harvests is valid, the same has
not yet expired for there were no harvests during the six years from 1940-41 to
1946-47, hence, the said 45 crop-years will expire only in 1971-1972, hence,
landowners' threat of closing the right of way is premature;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That assuming that the 45 year-period has

sugar mill by virtue of the sugar cane delivered to the mill regardless of the
contract relations,' and that according to Asturias Sugar Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span> (69 Phil. 725) the contractual relations of
planter and miller con­tinues by operation of law even after the expiration of
the contract, then, the contractual obligation of the defendants to give such
right of way to plain­tiff Central continues up to the present, hence, closing
a said right of way is an impairment of that obligation;</blockquote>

between the Central and the adhered planters, and the adhered planters

in the perform­ance of the plaintiff in putting up the railways, with­out which
collective promises or commitments, the plaintiff could not have built said
railways, and since the contract is entire, it may not be termi­nated
piecemeal, for an entire contract stands or falls together, hence, since the
contracts or rights of way of most adhered Planters have not expired (assuming
those of the defendants have expired), the entire contract is not deemed to
have expired;</blockquote>

same may not be removed without payment of the value the said railway tracks as
well as the locomotives and cane cars using the same amounting to not less than
P7 million, while on the other hand, the plaintiff is willing to buy the land
covered by the railway tracks in Hacienda 'Helvetia' at the price that may be
fixed by the court,, being smaller in value than the cost of improvements
attached to the land, hence, impeding the passage thereof, which will amount to
appropriating said improve­ments, without compensation, and without a hear­ing,
hence, a denial of due process of law (sec. 1[1 &amp; 2], ART. III,
Constitution);</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Viewed in the light of the time-honored principles above
restated, the problem at hand may be narrowed down to the inquiry:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has the Central made allegations in its
complaints (original as well as amended) sufficient in law to entitle it to the
principal re­lief therein sought, that is, "a legal easement of the right
of way" over the <u>hacienda</u> Helvetia, so as to justify the lower
court's issu­ance of the disputed preliminary writ of injunction?</p>

<p class="BODY">By express provision of articles 649 and 650 of the new Civil
Code, the owner of an estate may claim a compulsory right of way only after he
has established the existence of four requisites, namely, (1) the estate is
surrounded by other <span class="SpellE">immovables</span> and is without
adequate outlet to a public highway; (2) after payment of the proper indemnity;
(3) the isolation was not due to the proprietor's own acts; and (4) the right
of way claimed is "at a point least preju­dicial to the <span class="SpellE">servient</span> estate, and in so far as consistent with this
rule, where the distance from the dominant estate to a public high-way may be
the shortest." The <u>onus</u> is upon the owner of the do­minant estate
to show by specific averments in his complaint the existence of the requisites
or pre-conditions enumerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
granting a writ of preliminary injunction, the order of the court must show by
specific finding, even preliminary, that the pre-conditions exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus - </p>

<blockquote>"By express provision of law [Arts. 649 650, N.C.C.],
therefore, a compulsory right of way can not be obtained unless the four requi­sites
enumerated are first shown to exist, and the burden of proof to show their
existence was on the Central. Nowhere in the complaint is any specific
averment, nor is there in the Court of First Instance orders for the issuance
of the writ of temporary in­junction, and denying its reconsideration, any
specific finding, even preliminary, that each and every­one of the four
preconditions do exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * This de­ficiency
made the issuance of a preliminary injunc­tion improvident and arbitrary, for
the first condi­tion for the granting of the writ is 'that the plaintiff <u>is
entitled to the relief demanded'</u> (sec. 3(a), Rule 58, Revised Rules) and
'that the complaint in the action is verified, <u>and shows facts entitling the
plaintiff to the relief demanded</u>' (sec. 4[a], Rule 58).”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Let us now take a look at the original complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central alleged therein that the <u>hacienda</u> <st1:place>Helvetia</st1:place>
completely surrounds the mill site "at its eastern side where the rail­road
tracks enter." This allegation hardly satisfies requisite (1) above, for
it fails to aver that it is "without adequate outlet to a pu­blic
highway." The Central's own "Sketch" (annex A) conclusively
shows that the mill site is easily accessible from various points through the
existing provincial roads of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mur­cia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
aside from the main roads in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation in the complaint that the railroad tracks are
"absolutely indispensable" for the operation of the Central is belied
by the fact that during the 1964-1965 crop year, most of the sugar cane
harvested in the adherent plantations was hauled to the Central by the use of
trucks and truck-trailers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the
same means of transportation used by two new sugar centrals in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental - the First Farmers Milling Company and
the AIDSISA - following the universal practice in <st1:state><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be true that the railroad tracks provide an economical and convenient
means of transportation to and from the mill site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, our Civil Code speaks of
necessity and not of comfort and convenience.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Central also alleged that it is willing to pay a
"reasonable compensation to be fixed by the Court," corresponding to
the value of the 22,712-sq.m. portion of the <u>hacienda</u> traversed by the
railroad tracks, as well as the resultant damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We observe, however, that this manifestation
of willingness to pay was made for the first time only in the Central's
complaint, and this only after the Landowners had made known their intention to
make full use of their <u>hacienda</u> for their own purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Central, before then, made no genuine
attempt to negotiate with the Landowners for the continued use of the railroad
tracks, and kept on using them for its benefit, totally disregarding the
proprietary rights of the landowners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise the Central has not demonstrated that the isola­tion of
the mill site - assuming that isolated it is - was due to the Landowners'
acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With full awareness that the
conventional easement of right of way would expire at the end of the crop year
1964-1965 - which means that from then on the Landowners would be freed from
the burdens imposed by the covenants entered into by their
predecessors-in-interest - the Central did not seasonably pursue step to
prevent the inevitable isolation consequent to the termina­tion of the printed
amended milling contracts of 1936.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently realizing that its original complaint fails to state a
solid cause of action upon which may be legally predicated the issuance of the
writ of injunction in question, the Central aban­doned its original
theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its amended complaint is the
altoge­ther new thematic insistence that the Central, by virtue of specifi­cally
named laws and legal principles, has become the <u>owner</u> of the strip of
land' traversed by the railroad tracks in the <u>hacienda</u> Helvetia, which
dominion sufficiently invests the disputed writ of injunction with intrinsic
validity.</p>

<p class="BODY">This new development has compelled us to examine the allegations
of the amended complaint and their implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After mature deliberation, we reach the view
that the said amended complaint does not render the Central's position any less
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central initially maintains therein that its right to the
continued use of the railroad tracks traversing the <u>hacienda</u>, after the
printed amended milling contracts of 1936 expired with the 1964-1865 crop year,
is authorized by sections 2 and 7 of Act 2479 (enacted February 5, 1913),
otherwise known as the "Sugar Central Act." These sections read:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be
the duty of this board to promote and aid in the establishment of sugar
centrals with their machinery, equipment, rights of way, railroads, and other
appurtenances for the manufacture of sugar and industries derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in the sugar-producing provinces, if in its
judgment the local conditions warrant the establishment of a sugar
central."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sum not to
exceed two million pesos of the gold standard fund shall be available for
investment by the Insular Treasurer, with the approval of the Governor-General,
in accordance with the provisions of this Act:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided</u>, That the central sugar board shall not purchase bonds
of any corporation except under the following terms and conditions, among
others: That the amount of bonds issued by the corporation shall not exceed
sixty per centum of the value of the property offered as security; that before
such pur­chase is made, such corporation shall have con­tracts with the owners
of not less than one thou­sand hectares of land suitable for the cultivation of
sugar, obligating such owners to cultivate in sugar cane a reasonable area of
their holdings and to deliver and sell to the corporation all the sugar cane
produced on such land and <u>to convey to the corporation may deem necessary
for roads and rail roads connecting the mill with the fields</u>; * * *.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is argued that Act 2479 envisioned a
sugar central and "railroads connecting the same to the plantations and
rights of way for the said railroads;" that the Central having been
created and financed by the said Act, the printed amended milling contracts of
1936 were also entered into in accordance with the intendment and pro­visions
thereof; that the underscored words of section 7 above, reading "to convey
to the corporation such rights of way as the corporation may deem necessary for
roads and railroads connect­ing the mill with the fields," must be
construed to mean "to trans­fer title," and the words "such
rights of way" include not only the easement of railroad rights of way but
also the strips of land tra­versed thereby; that, therefore, the quoted portion
of section 7 should be understood to mean to transfer to the Central title to
such rights of way as it may deem necessary for railroad tracks, including the
strips of land of the <u>hacienda</u> Helvetia and other areas surrounding the
mill site traversed by the railroad tracks; and that the amended milling
contract of 1936 in so far as it did not provide for such transfer or
conveyance, but instead provided for "45-year contractual limitation,"
is null and void, and in violation of sections 2 and 7 of the said Act, in
relation to article 1300<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
of the new Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The construction given by the Central to the word
"convey" is its broad and comprehensive meaning, that is, to transfer
pro­perty or title to property from one person to another.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The word "convey" may, however, include any other transaction by
which any interest in real estate is created, short of transferring title
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
And construing the word in reference to the entire context of section 7, <u>supra,</u>
more specifically in the light of the words, "rights of way,” we hold that
when the Philippine Legislature used the word "convey, it intended merely
to allow, to permit, to grant, the Central "such rights of way" in
the <u>hacienda</u> Helvetia and other surrounding areas, short of transferring
ownership of the strips of land traversed by such rights of way.</p>

<p class="BODY">A "right of way" is an <u>easement</u>, an <u>encumbrance</u>
on a <span class="SpellE">ser­vient</span> estate, a <u>real right of limited use
without possession and ownership</u> of the land upon which the easement was
established.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This, we are persuaded, is the meaning of the word "<span class="SpellE"><u>servidumbres</u></span>"
as used by the parties in the printed amended milling contract of 1936, which
word, we must assume, was deliberately employed by them to express the real
intention of the Act itself and of their own:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">todas</span> <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">servidumbres</span> <span class="SpellE">para</span> <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">vias</span>
<span class="SpellE">ferreas</span></u>, y <span class="SpellE">para</span> <span class="SpellE">otros</span> fines, clue el <span class="SpellE">Plantador</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> el <span class="SpellE">presente</span> concede al
Molino, <span class="SpellE">seran</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> un <span class="SpellE">periodo</span> de <span class="SpellE">cuarenta</span> y <span class="SpellE">cinco</span> <span class="SpellE">años</span> o <span class="SpellE">cosechas</span>,
a <span class="SpellE">contar</span> <span class="SpellE">desde</span> la <span class="SpellE">cosecha</span> de 1920-1921." This conclusion is fortified by
the admonition of the Civil Code that conveyance should be interpreted to
effect "the least transmission of rights"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
- and is there a better example of least transmission of rights than merely
allowing or permitting the use without transfer of possession and ownership of
the strip of land traversed by the railroad tracks?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At all events, if we are to follow the theory
espoused by the Central, the use of the term "rights of way" in
sections 2 and 7 of Act 2479 would be a patent superfluity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if the said sections already conveyed to
the Central the ownership of the land on which the railroad tracks are laid,
the law itself would have dispensed with any mention or refer­ence to
"rights of way." We surmise that the law advisedly did not purport to
convey in fee simple the affected strips of land because if it did so it would
perhaps be afflicted with constitutional infirmity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next contention of the Central is that in view of the
provisions of sections 2 and 7 of Act 2479, <u>supra</u> the milling contracts
of 1930 are null and void insofar as they provided a contractual limitation of
45 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our mind, this does not
merit extended attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For there is
nothing in the entire context of the said Act nor in article 1306 of the new
Civil Code (cited by the Cen­tral in connection with the Act) that supports,
either expressly or inferentially, this proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we regard the argument as pure
casuistry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the long span of 45 years,
the Central not only did not question the validity of any single provision of
the mill­ing contracts but, as far as we gather from the record, even
unremittingly exacted compliance therewith from the signatories thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that the term of the contracts has
expired, and the Central finds itself beset with difficulties, it executes a
complete turn- about and invokes the invalidity of the said contracts to
relieve it­self of the inconveniences and vicissitudes confronting it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next argument of the Central is that, assuming that the
milling contracts are valid, its "right of way has not yet expired"
for the reason that there were no harvests during the crop years 1941-42 to
1946-47, and for this reason the 45 crop years envisioned in the contracts
would expire only with the crop year 1971-72.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This argument is likewise specious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A close scrutiny of the milling contracts can yield no inference that
the inability on the part of the adhered plantations to raise sugar cane during
the crop years alluded to automatically extended the contractual period of 45
years, Besides, the issue presented is not really one of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Nueno</span> vs.
Angeles,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that the occupation of the Philippines by the Japanese Imperial Forces
did not suspend the running of the term of office of the members of the
municipal board of Manila, and in two other cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
we ruled that the terms of contracts of lease of urban properties were not
suspended by the fact that the lessees did not enjoy the possession of the
leased properties during such occupation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reasoning by analogy, we hold the view that the intend­ment of the
rulings in the cases adverted to applies with equal force to resolve the issue
at bar against the Central's pretension.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central further maintains that pursuant to section 1,
subparagraph 4(c) of Act 4166, otherwise known as "the Sugar Limi­tation
Law" (approved December 14, 1934), providing that</p>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term “mill district' is used to mean a
centrifugal sugar mill together with all plantations adherent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A plantation is adhered by virtue of sugar
cane being delivered <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to a mill regardless
of contract relations between the mill company and the plantation owner and/ or
any other person cultivating sugar cane on the plantation,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the expiration of the term of the amended
milling contracts of 1936 has not resulted in the absence of a contract between
the parties, for Act 4166 stepped in to effect renewal of the said contracts,
and because the rights of way are a part thereof, these perforce conti­nue to
exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view that the Sugar Limitation Law is erroneous­ly
invoked as authority to sustain the above proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike sections 2 and 7 of Act 2479 which
expressly provided for the establishment of "such rights of way as the
corporation may deem necessary for roads and railroad connecting the mill with
the fields," Act 4166, even with the amendments introduced by Commonwealth
Acts 77 and 323 and Republic Acts 1072 and 1825, contains no provi­sion
conferring upon the Central the right to establish rights of way in the lands
of the adherent planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
appear from its title and declaration of policy that Act 4166 was enacted
solely for the purposes of limiting and allocating the production of sugar in
the Philippines as well as regulating the processing and marketing thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">For disparity in factual settings, the doctrine enunciated in <st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Asturias</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>
is inapplicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case referred to a
planter who had a <u>verbal</u> milling contract with a central before the crop
year 1931-1932.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this contract the
former received from the latter a certain form of bonus as additional
participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the crop years
1932-1933 and 1933-1934, the planter milled his sugar cane with another
central.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the passage of Act 4166
in 1934, the planter <u>resumed</u> milling his sugar cane with the first
central.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolving the question whether
the planter was entitled to the same bonus which the central had given him in
the 1931-1932 and previous crop years, this Court ruled in the affirmative,
holding that there was an <u>indeclinable <span class="SpellE">reassumption</span></u>
both by the central and the plan­ter of their contract subsisting before the
1931-1932 crop year, <u>re­newing the relations which between the then existed</u>,
they finding themselves necessarily obligated by the undertakings which they
had mutually assumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart, therefore,
from the fact that the issue therein posed is completely alien to the main
issue in the present case, which is, whether the Central is entitled to a right
of way over the <u>hacienda</u> Helvetia, the inescapable, fundamental and
decisive difference is that the verbal milling contract of the parties in <u>Asturias</u>
was deemed renewed to govern the relationship which existed between them; while
in the case at bar, the amended milling contracts of 1936 were not renewed
after they expired at the end of the 1964-65 crop year.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central further maintains that the amended milling contracts
of 1936 constitute "one entire and indivisible contract," for the
collective performance of the planters in granting the rights of way was the
consideration of the Central in laying the railways, without which collective
commitment the latter would not have built the tracts, and for this reason the
"entire and indivisible contract" may not be terminated piecemeal, as
to terminate the same would require the collective action of all the adhered
planters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The novelty of this argument does not imply its validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended milling contracts were distinct
contracts entered into by the Central separately with the individual
planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say, in effect, that all
the contracts created obligations not only between each individual planter and
the Central but also between the planters themselves, is to offend against
logic and common sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in any
event, the rights of way granted by the so-called "entire and in­divisible
contracts” all expired collectively at the same time at the end of the
1964-1965 crop year, so that whatever collective and indivisible obligations
and covenants were supposedly agreed upon ceased to have any force and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central finally contends that it is a <u>possessor in good
faith</u> of the right of way traversing the <u>hacienda</u> <st1:place>Helvetia</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Invoking article 448 of the new Civil Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
it argues that the railroad tracks may not be removed without payment by the
Landowners of their value as well as that of the locomotives and cane cars
using the same, all amounting to not less than P7 million, and asserts that on
the other hand, "the Central is willing to buy the land covered by the
railway tracks in Hacienda 'Helvetia' at the price that may be fixed by the
court, being smaller in value than the cost of improvements attached to the
land."</p>

<p class="BODY">Good faith is one of the basic concepts articulated in article
448 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is present
where one builds</u> or sows or plants <u>on land in which he believes himself
to have a claim of title</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the Central cannot validly lay claim to that good faith, because
it knew and recognized from as early as 1920 that the strip of land traversed
by its railroad tracks was owned and possessed by the Landowners.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an assiduous analysis and examination of the order <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> of October 4, 1965, the allegations of the complaint and the amended
complaint, and the other pleadings in the record, we con­clude that the
Central’s conventional right of way over the <u>hacienda</u> Helvetia ceased
with the expiration of the amended milling contracts at the end of the
1964-1965 crop year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of a
renewal contract or the establishment of a compulsory servitude of right of way
on the same spot and route which must be predicated on the sa­tisfaction of the
preconditions required by law, there subsists no right of way to be protected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our view, the following pronouncements made by Mr. Justice
J.B. L. Reyes in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia Milling Co. vs.
Capitol Subdivision, <u>supra</u>, control the present case:</p>

<blockquote>"In truth, the court of origin seems to have proceeded on the
erroneous assumption that, even after expiration of its contractual right of
way, pe­titioner Central was entitled to a compulsory right of way in the same
location and route it had been using up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is, not true:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the Central's use of the present railway for
the pre­ceding 45 years was based on the assent of the Subdivision's
predecessors-in-interest, as evidenced by their milling contract, while a
compulsory ser­vitude of right of way on the same spot and route must be
predicated on the minimum inconvenience to the would-be <span class="SpellE">servient</span>
estate, in addition to the other requisites above set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no spe­cific finding by the court of
origin that the prere­quisites exist, and the lack of it suffices to negate the
Central's right to the servitude claimed, as it likewise negates the propriety
of the temporary injunction issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In issuing the preliminary writ for defendant to permit the
Central to use its railway, in the manner established under the milling
contract, the court of origin in effect extended that corres­ponding part of
the contract even beyond the term stipulated by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action is not war­ranted by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The function of an injunction is the
maintenance of the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> as of the time of its issuance, and
at that time, the right of the Cen­tral under the milling contract had
uncontrovertibly expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It needs no
emphasizing that the court can not create contracts between the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"[T]he preliminary injunction was issued on an erroneous
premise, 'the premature assump­tion that respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia
Milling Co., Inc., is entitled to the legal easement prayed for by it', since
the existence of the statutory requisites for such easement had not been
properly averred or proved, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Of course, petitioner may duly show at the hearing on the merits that the
preconditions required by the Civil Code do actually exist; but until that is
done, the right to the legal servitude is not clear, and the writ of injunction
is unwarranted, and issued in grave abuse of discretion."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
