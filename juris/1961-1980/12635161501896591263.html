of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Negros</span></span><span style=""> </span>Occidental
in Civil Case No. 5040 granting the petition of Chua <span class="SpellE">Uan</span>,
alias Peter Chua, to be allowed to take his oath as a citizen of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1960</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered by the abovementioned court in Civil Case No. 5040
granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> application for naturalization as
a Filipino <span class="SpellE">citiizen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, in
representation of the Solicitor General, appealed from said decision to <span class="GramE">Us</span> (G. R. No. L-16923) claiming, that it was contrary to the
provisions of Section 2, paragraph of Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended,
which requires applicants for citizenship to be able to speak and write English
or Spanish and any principal Philippine dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="9">September
 12, 1960</st1:date>, however, a motion to wit draw the appeal was filed by
Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>
and Solicitor Hector C. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> and the same was granted
by <span class="GramE">Us</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of January 30, 1960 having become final, on February
6, 1962 <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed with the lower court a
petition to be allowed to take his oath of allegiance <span style="">as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the court, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="10"><span style="">October
 27, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, issued the
appealed order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Government claims that the Court a quo erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, in not finding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had not conducted himself in 3 proper and
irreproachable manner; secondly, in not holding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
can not speak and write any one of the principal Philippine languages; thirdly,
in not holding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> failed to prove
indubitably <span style="">he had not left the
Philippines since the </span><span style="">promul</span><span style="">gation of the decision granting his petition
for naturalization and lastly, in granting <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
application for oath taking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of the first
the Government contends that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had used the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">alias
Peter Chua without legal authority, as shown by his own petition for
naturalization; the document Exhibit A, which is a clearance issued by the
Court of First Instance of Occidental </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Negros</span></span><span style="">; </span><span style="">Exhibit B, which is a
similar document issued by the office of the Provincial Fiscal of the same
province, and lastly, his own certificate of baptism Exhibit M.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon an examination of the record, however, <span class="GramE">We</span><span style=""> </span>find that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has satisfactorily explained the use more apparent than real - of the name
Peter Chua.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to his <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony, he has not used nor does he
intend to use said alias; that he has always signed his name <span style="">as </span>Chua <span class="SpellE">Uan</span>;
that the alleged alias was made to appear in <span style="">his </span>baptismal certificate, without his knowledge and consent,
through an honest mistake committed by a price of San Sebastian Catholic Church
where be Teas baptized on March <span style="">11, </span>1953.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Government not only
made no attempt to disprove this testimony but likewise utterly failed to prove
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> - personally - had ever made use of the
aforesaid alias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibits A, B, and M
where said alias appears as referring to him are documents issued and/or signed
by other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">obvious that <span class="SpellE">appeleeâ€™s</span> application for
naturalization was made </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">name of Chua <span class="SpellE">Uan</span>,
alias Peter Chua, for the purpose of making said application conform <span class="GramE">with</span> what appeared on <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
certificate of baptism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, had he
not done so, he could be charged with failing to disclose a material fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Government attempts to prove its contention in the second
alleged error by pointing to the fact that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
own application for naturalization simply<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
alleges that he knew "how to read, write and speak in Chinese language; he
also knows how to read and writ, the English language and speak and understands
Filipino dialects", and that in the very decision of the lower court of
January 30, 1960 the Court simply said that "petitioner knows how to write
and speak the English language any he speaks and understands <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span> dialect".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this the conclusion is drawn that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
failed to prove that he could speak and <u>write</u> at least one of the
principle Philippine languages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this regard, we are of
the opinion that the decision of January 30, 1960, reasonably construed, means
that the petitioner in the case not only spoke but could write in the <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span> dialect; for if the Court did not mean this
precisely, it would have dismissed the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, this question
may now be deemed finally settled by reason of the motion for the withdrawal of
</span>the appeal in G. R. No. L-16923 filed by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Barot</span> and Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> upon the
ground that, after <span style="">a </span>careful
study of the evidence, they found no ground warranting the prosecution of the
appeal; that upon an examination of the record they had discovered that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had demonstrated his competence on this
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated heretofore, we granted
the petition accepting these allegations as true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Solicitor General may not
now be heard to say that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> failed to prove his
ability to write at least one of the principal Philippine dialects.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with the
third assignment of error, t</span>he Government admits that during the hearing
on <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for leave to take the oath as
a Filipino citizen, testified under oath that since the promulgation of th<span style="">e </span>decision of January 30, 1960, he had
never left the Philippines having dedicated himself to his profession <span style="">as </span>cashier of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
United Hardware, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> <span style="">City, </span>and that during the intervening period he had not been
convicted of any offense or violation of any rule or regulation promulgated by
the duly constituted authorities nor committed any act prejudicial to the best
interest of the nation or contrary to any government announced policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, this testimony was accepted as true
and sufficient by the court a quo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the Government made no attempt whatsoever to show that any
portion thereof was not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We, </span>therefore, find this third <span style="">contention of the appellant </span>to be
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth and last assignment of error is but a mere corollary
of the previous three.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having arrived at
the above conclusions, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that no further
discussion <span style="">thereof is necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed order being in accordance <span style="">with law, the same is affirmed, without
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
