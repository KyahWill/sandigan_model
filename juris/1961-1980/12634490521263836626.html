<span class="GramE">We</span> issued the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a petition to review and annul the resolution of the
respondent Commission on Elections of October 17, 1963 denying petitioner's
petition to declare invalid the certificates of candidacy filed by the other
respondents herein, for failure to comply with the provisions of Section 32 of
the Revised Election Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 3522, in that said
certificates of candidacy did not contain a waiver of the privilege from public
disclosure of said respondents' income tax returns and tax census statements for
the years 1961 and 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, said
Commission advised its co-respondents to file, immediately, amended
certificates of candidacy including said waiver, even after the lapse of the
period for the filing thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the possibility that the respondents - except the
Commission on Elections - failed to be elected in the elections held in 1963 -
which, if true, would render the present case academic - the petitioner
Francisco Ortiz is hereby required to show cause, within five days from notice,
why the petition for review should not be dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1967</st1:date>,
pursuant to the above resolution, petitioner, through counsel, filed a
MANIFESTATION AND MOTION praying that <span class="GramE">We</span> dismiss his petition
for review without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding the above motion for dismissal to be in order, the same
is granted, without costs.</p>
