P. Mendoza and Assistant Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Reynato</span> S.
<span class="SpellE">Puno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
comment as well as that submitted by respondent Philippine National Union
Council were considered as answers, and the petition was deemed submitted for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite evident even from
a cursory perusal of the responsive pleadings filed by the respondents that the
challenged order is precisely in accordance with Article 257 of the Labor Code
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and is thus free from any infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less could the allegation of
arbitrariness be taken seriously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was in addition the minor point raised that a memorandum circular of the
Department of Labor was not observed by respondent Director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside of the well-settled principle that in
<i>certiorari </i>proceedings, only a grave abuse of discretion would call for
a reversal of the actuation complained of, a mere error of law not sufficing,
it has likewise been pointed out in the comment of the Solicitor General that
such memorandum circular, even on the assumption that there was no compliance
with it, was issued on September 5, 1974 prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the present Labor Code</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which came into force on November 1 of that
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the petition lacks merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It could be that in its
attempt to impart some measure of plausibility, petitioner </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> was far from precise in its allegation of
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a deficiency was remedied in
the comment filed on behalf of respondent Director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter in controversy started with the
Philippine National Union Council, on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, filing with the Bureau of Labor Relations a
petition for the holding of a certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It set forth therein that its ranks comprise
a majority of membership at the Today's Knitting Company, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also stated that at the hearing of
such petition, the signatures of its members authorizing the filing of the
petition would be submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was,
on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="4" month="5"><span style="">May 4, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">,
a petition for intervention on behalf of petitioner Today's Knitting Free
Workers Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It saw no need for a
certification election, asserting that it had already been voluntarily
recognized by the management as the bargaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Labor Relations received on the
same day ten one-page resolutions by the rank-and­-file employees of respondent
Today's Knitting Company, Inc. authorizing the filing of the petition for
certification election with a total of two hundred (200) signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Company apparently looked with
favor on the claim of petitioner as shown by a pleading dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="6"><span style="">June 21,
 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It affirmed the assertion that <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> union, now petitioner, had been recognized by
management as representing the majority of the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent </span><st1:place><span style="">Union</span></st1:place><span style=""> countered with the allegation in a pleading
dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="6"><span style="">June 29, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">
that there was no legal bar to the petition for certification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="7"><span style="">July 19, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
M. Jimenez issued an order granting the petition for certification
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was then appealed
to the Bureau of Labor Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="9"><span style="">September
 9, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
Director issued the challenged order denying the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered a certification election to be
conducted by the Bureau within twenty days from receipt of the resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
petition with this Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As set forth at the
outset, the petition cannot prosper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. To sustain what on its face appears to be an insubstantial claim
of failure to abide by statutory command as set forth in the Labor Code,
petitioner would interpret its Article 257 of requiring that it be afforded the
right to examine the alleged signatures of the employees comprising at least
the 30% of the bargaining unit desirous of holding a certification
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a rather strained
construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statutory provision
reads: "<u>Requisites for certification election</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>— Any petition for certification election
filed by any legitimate labor organization shall be supported by the written
consent of at least 30% of all the employees in the bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt and verification of such
petition, it shall be mandatory for the Bureau to conduct a certification
election for the purpose of determining the representative of the employees in
the appropriate bargaining unit and certify the winner as the exclusive
collective bargaining representative of all the employees in the unit."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">It speaks clearly and categorically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no element of ambiguity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required is that the petition for
certification election should have in its favor "the written consent of at
least 30% of all the employees in the bargaining unit." The duty then cast
on the Director of Labor Relations is to ascertain whether there has been such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">compliance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt in this case there was
evidence that more than a total of two-hundred signatures were obtained by
respondent Union in seeking such </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">certification election. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The respondent Director having satisfied
himself that the <span class="SpellE">codal</span> requisite had been met, he had
no choice but to order such certification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the language of the above provision, "it shall be mandatory for
the Bureau to conduct a certification election for the purpose of determining
the representative of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit and
certify the winner as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of all
the employees in the unit." There is, therefore, no basis for the contention
that a duty is cast on respondent Director to allow a rival labor organization,
such as petitioner, to verify the authenticity of such signatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, if there is any doubt as to the
required number having been met, what better way is there than the holding of a
certification election to ascertain which union really commands the allegiance
of the rank-and-file employees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The comment of the Solicitor General likewise included this
excerpt from this Court's recent decision in Philippine Association of Free
Labor Unions v. Bureau of Labor Relations:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
"Petitioner's contention to the effect that the 30% requirement should be
satisfied suffers from an ever graver flaw.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It fails to distinguish between the right of a labor organization to be
able to persuade <span style="">30% of the labor force
to petition for a certification election, in which case respondent Bureau with
no choice but to order it, and the power of such governmental agency precisely
entrusted with the implementation of the collective bargaining process to
determine, considering the likelihood that there may be several unions within a
bargaining unit to order such an election precisely for the purpose of
ascertaining which of them shall<span style="">&nbsp; </span>be the
exclusive bargaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision of respondent </span><span style="">Bureau </span><span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4"><span style="">April 14, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> was intended for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was why not only petitioner but also the
Philippine Federation of Labor, the National Labor Union, the National
Federation of Labor Unions and the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Kawani</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> AG&amp;P were
included in the list of labor unions that could be voted on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reiterate a thought already expressed,
what could be more appropriate than such a procedure if the goal desired is to
enable labor to determine which of the competing organizations should represent
if for the purpose of a collective bargaining contract?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How then can it be seriously asserted that
the decision now appealed could be stigmatized as contrary to law?"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Such a holding reinforces the correctness of a decision arrived
at by respondent Director and negates even more conclusively the imputation of
arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not amiss to state
that petitioner has the same office address as Philippine Association of Free
Labor Unions in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So with its counsel, Attorney Julius A. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is a
different member of the bar who appeared for such labor organization in the
case <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span>, it thus appears that a more diligent
study of pertinent decisions could have avoided the filing of this suit and
thus hasten the effective and speedy implementation of the statutory scheme to
have a certification election conducted precisely for the purpose of living
true to the concept of industrial democracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the present, it suffices to call the attention of counsel to the
desirability of being acquainted with applicable decisions, especially one that
strikes so close to home, even if, or perhaps more precisely when, the ruling
is adverse to one's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to
live true to his duty as an officer of the court on whose trustworthiness
reliance may be placed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Not much attention need be paid, as pointed out in the comment
of the Solicitor General, to the allegation in the petition that a memorandum
circular of the Secretary of Labor dated <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1974</st1:date> was disregarded by respondent Director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true there was therein stated that
where there is a bona fide union comprising the majority voluntarily recognized
and in the process of <span style="">negotiating a
contract, an application for a certification election should not be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, a memorandum circular
certainly cannot prevail as against the very language of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is merely to state the obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, as pointed out by the
Solicitor-General, from and after November 1, 1974 when the present Labor Code
became effective, previous circulars of the Secretary of Labor to take care of
the transitional stage prior to its coming into force, certainly were deemed
superseded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From any standpoint then, it
cannot be gainsaid that the petition certainly lacks juridical basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is not called upon then to
exercise its power to grant <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to correct a
grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No abuse has
been shown, much less one amounting to arbitrariness of sufficient gravity to
call for the issuance of the writs prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition is dismissed for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
