				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The matter before the Court is a motion for leave to file a second
motion for reconsideration which, in truth, is already a motion for
reconsideration because it prays "that the two resolutions of this
Honorable Court dated November 5 and December 2, 1968 be corrected and that the
petition for certiorari be given due course".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1968</st1:date>
petitioner filed a petition for the review, by way of certiorari, of the
decision of the Court of Appeals in G. R. No. CA-02912-CR finding him guilty of
homicide, with two aggravating circumstances and one mi­tigating circumstance,
and sentencing him accordingly, and praying, as a consequence, that said case
"be ordered re­opened and that a new trial be granted with the end in view
of allowing the introduction of Annexes <span style="">A,
</span>B and C, as evidence, so that they could be considered by the court
before rendering a final judgment on the merits of the criminal
case".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By our resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1968</st1:date> <span class="GramE">We</span>
denied said petition "for being late".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's counsel received notice of this
resolution by registered mail on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="11">November
 11, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten (10) <span style="">days thereafter, or more, specifically, on
November 21 he </span><span style="">filed a motion
for </span><span style="">reconsideration </span><span style="">which we denied in our resolution of December
2, both dates of the year 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner received notice of this last resolution on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="12"><span style="">December
 6, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eleven (11) days thereafter, or on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="12"><span style="">December
 17, </span><span style="">1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">he
</span><span style="">filed the motion for leave etc. under
consider</span><span style="">ation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 1, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court, the motion for
leave etc. was filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the question of
whether or not the </span><span style="">petition for
certiorari was filed </span><span style="">on time,
the record shows the follow­ing:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner received notice of the decision of the Court of
Appeals on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the fifteen-day period for the
filing of a petition for certiorari by way of appeal to the Supreme Court, or
for the filing of <span style="">a </span>motion for
rehearing was to expire on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As petitioner was granted by the Court of
Appeals thirty days extension for the filing of a motion for reconsideration
and/or new trial, the period therefore to appeal by certiorari was extended up
to <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">filed
his motion for reconsideration and/or new trial on July 23, 1968 </span><span style="">–</span><span style="">
admittedly within the extended period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's motion for
reconsideration and/or new trial mentioned above was denied by the Court of
Appeals </span><span style="">in its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="8"><span style="">August 6,
 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, notice of
which was received by petitioner on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="8"><u><span style="">August 22, 1968</span></u></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1, Rule 45 of
the Rules of Court, he had fifteen days from </span><st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="8"><span style="">August 23, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> (inclusive) within </span><span style="">which to appeal </span><span style="">by certiorari from the decision of the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said period expired </span>on
<st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="9"><u><span style="">September 6, 1968</span></u></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 23, 1968 petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals
again a motion for permission to file <span style="">a
</span>second motion for reconsideration and/or new trial, which said <span style="">Court denied in its resolution of September
3, 1968, notice of which was received by petitioner either on the 10th or 11th
of September of the same year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The abovementioned motion
for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration and/or new trial – contrary
to the belief apparently entertained by petitioner's counsel – did not suspend
the running of the period of fifteen days provided for in Section 1 of Rule
45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither, of course, did the
subsequent motions for reconsideration filed by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, when he filed his petition for
certiorari with <span class="GramE">Us</span> on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="10"><span style="">October 29, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, the period provided for in Section 1, Rule
45, had long expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the reason
why </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">denied
the same </span><span style="">in our resolution of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="11"><span style="">November
 5, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
