				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for certiorari filed by the State to annul an order of
the respondent Judge Meynardo A. Tiro (Presiding Judge of the Circuit Criminal
Court, 15th Judicial District, at Iligan City), promulgated on August 6, 1970
in criminal case CCC-XV-14- Lanao del Norte, entitled "People of the
Philippines vs. Major Felipe U. Carreon, Jr. and Corporal Sergio Atwil,"
which order directed the delivery of "Major Felipe Carreon and Cpl. Sergio
Atwil to their Commanding General, the IV PC Zone Commander, at Camp
Evangelista, Cagayan de Oro City, for safekeeping, pursuant to Executive Order
No. 106, Series of 1937 and 'the original Order of Honorable Judge Hernando
Pineda of the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte, dated June 16, 1970,
with the instruc­tions that the two accused should be kept within the camp pre­mises
of Camp Evangelista, Cagayan de Oro City, and that should it be necessary for
any of the accused to leave said premises for medical purposes and the like,
the proper petition should be filed before this Court with prior notice to the
prosecution."</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential facts are not complicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 24, 1969 City Fiscal Cicero C. Jurado of Iligan filed
an information charging Major Felipe U. Carreon, Jr. and Cpl. Sergio Atwil with
the crime of <u>murder</u>, committed, in the language of the information, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 21, 1969, in the City of Iligan,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said
accused, conspiring and confederating <span style="">together
and mutually helping each other, armed with deadly weapons, to wit: .38 and .45
caliber firearms, by means of treache­ry and evident premeditation, and with
intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlaw­fully and feloniously
attack, assault, shoot, hit and wound one Judge Erlito L. Echiverri, thereby
inflicting upon him the following phy­sical injuries to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Massive Hemorrhage Chest and Abdomen</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Gunshot wounds</blockquote>

<blockquote>which caused his death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law and in violation of Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code, with the aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident
premedita­tion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">At the end of the information appear the
following words: "No Bail Recommended."</p>

<p class="BODY">Application was thereafter made with the City Court of Iligan by <span style="">defense </span>counsel Major Jovito Pinatakan
for the delivery of the two accused for safe-keeping, pending trial, to their
com­manding officer, invoking the provisions of paragraph <span style="">4, Execu­tive </span>Order 106, series 1937,
which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case the judge
or justice of the peace will bind over any officer or enlisted man under ar­rest
to answer a criminal charge, and such officer or enlisted man shall fail to
give bail, the person so in custody shall be delivered to the provincial com­mander
or to the commanding officer of the accused for safe-keeping and shall so
remain until acquitted or convicted on final judgment by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall <span style="">henceforth </span>be the duty of such officer
or provincial commander safely to keep and produce the prisoner <span style="">before the proper court at the proper
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If ne­cessary for the safe-keeping
of the prisoner, he may be committed to the provincial jail or the Bu­reau of
Prisons at Manila by the officer aforesaid."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
</span>an order dated April 10, 1970, City Judge Pompeyo L. Palarca of Iligan
ordered the commitment of the two accused to the custody of Major Jovito
Pinatakan at Camp Evangelista, Ca­gayan de Oro City.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 30, 1970,
because the accused had waived pre­liminary investigation, an information was
filed with Branch II of the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte
(criminal case no. 27) charging the two accused with </span><u>murder.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
information recites:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 21, 1969, in the City of Iligan,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honor­able Court, the said
accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping each other,
armed with deadly wea­pons, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>.38
and .45 caliber firearms, by means of treachery and evident preme­ditation, and
with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and felo­niously
attack, assault, shoot, hit and wound one Judge Erlito L. Echiverri, thereby <span style="">in­</span>flicting
upon him the following physical inju<span style="">ries,
to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Massive hemorrhage, chest
and </span>abdomen,</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Gunshot wounds,</blockquote>

<blockquote>which caused his death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to and in violation of <span style="">A</span>rticle 248 of the Revised Penal Code, with the aggravating cir­cumstances
of treachery and evident premeditation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private Prosecutors Juan Echiverri and Voltaire Rovira, on June
3, 1970, moved the said Court of First Instance for the commitment of the two
accused to the city jail of Iligan <span style="">City,
con­</span>tending that par. 4 of Executive Order 106 applies <span style="">only to crimi­</span>nal cases where the
offenses charged are bailable, and arguing that since the offense charged in
this case is murder, which is a capital offense, and no bail was recommended,
and the accused did not formally petition for bail, par. 4 of Executive Order <span style="">10</span>6 <span style="">therefore does not apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court denied this motion on June 16, 1970.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the case was transferred to the Circuit Criminal Court, and
after the prosecution had rested its case, the defense counsel presented an
oral demurrer to the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
demur­rer was denied on August 4, 1970, in the following words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x <span style="">x x </span>the evidence so far presented by the prosecution, if not
contra­dicted and rebutted by evidence of the defense, is sufficient to convict
the two accused beyond a reasonable doubt."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later the said circuit criminal
court issued the order of August 6, 1970, the legality of which is now challenged
by the petition at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner and the respondents are in agreement that
Executive Order 106, series of 1937, is a valid executive order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner contends however that par. 4
of This executive or­der does not apply to capital offenses, as in the case at
bar, whereas the respondents argue that the said provisions are man­datory upon
courts of justice in all cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hereunder again quote in full the provisions of para­graph 4
of Executive Order 106:</p>

<blockquote>"4. In case the judge or justice of the peace will bind over
any officer or enlisted man under ar­rest to answer a criminal charge, and such
officer or enlisted man <u>shall fail to give bail</u>, the person so in
custody shall be delivered to the provincial com­mander or to the commanding
officer of the accused for safe-keeping and shall so remain until acquitted or
convicted on final judgment by the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It shall henceforth be the duty of such officer or provincial commander
safely to keep and produce the prisoner <span style="">before
the </span>proper court at the proper time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If ne­cessary for the safe-keeping of the prisoner, he may be committed
to the provincial jail or the Bu<span style="">reau of
Prisons at Manila by the officer aforesaid." <span style="">(emphasis ours)</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Executive Order 106, series of 1937, which embodies fun­damental rules
and regulations governing the arrest of officers and enlisted men of the armed
forces, was issued and promulgat­ed by the then President Manuel L. Quezon of
the Philippine Com­monwealth, presumably in the exercise of the powers vested
in him as commander-in-chief of the armed forces by the provisions of section
10, clause 2, of article VII of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">was
no statute in existence, before the issuance of the said execu</span>tive
order, specifically and expressly empowering the President to issue the said
executive order. However, subsequent legisla­tion has recognized the rules
recited in the said executive order pertaining to the arrest and detention of
members of the armed forces who are criminally charged before the civil
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arti­cle 75 of Commonwealth Act
408 (approved September 14, 1938), otherwise known as the Articles of War,
requires the command­ing officer of a person accused before the civil courts
"to use <span style="">his utmost endeavor to
deliver over such accused person to the civil authorities, or to aid the
officers of justice in apprehending and securing him, in order that he may be
brought to trial. " Sec­tion 21 of Republic Act 138 (approved June 14,
1947), as amended by section 4 of Republic Act 1067 (approved June 12, 1954),
takes it for granted that officers 'and enlisted n-en accused of crimes before
the civil courts may or may not be held in the custody of the civil
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the said section
provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Except as
hereinafter pro­vided in this section, <u>officers and enlisted men lawfully
detained or provisionally released on bail by the civil authorities pending the
trial or final determination of their cases in the civil courts</u>, or serving
sentence of imprisonment, will receive no pay and allowances for the period of
their ab­sence from military control or custody.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b) Except as hereinafter provided in this section, <u>officers
and enlisted men who have re­turned to military control following their release
on bail or transfer to the custody of their respec­tive commanding officers for
safekeeping, pend­ing the trial or final determination of their cases in the
civil courts</u>, will receive no pay, as distinguished from allowances, for
any period of ab­sence from their regular duties by reason of the pendency of
their cases before the civil courts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) Should <span style="">any </span>officer
or enlisted man fall­ing under subsections (a) or (b) of this section be
unconditionally released by the civil authorities without trial, or after trial
and acquittal, or if the case against him before the civil courts is dis­missed
or otherwise terminated without conviction, or if he shall have been sentenced
to the penalty of destierro under Article two hundred and forty-seven of the
Revised Penal Code, he shall be entitled to receive the pay and allowances, or
pay, <span style="">as </span>the case may be, for
the period of his <u>absence from military </u><u><span style="">control</span></u><span style=""> and/or
regular duties: Provided, That the status of a person as absent without leave
or in de­sertion immediately prior to the time of his arrest or <u>detention by
the civil authorities</u>, and/or follow­ing his provisional or unconditional
release there­from, shall continue until his return to actual mili­tary
control, irrespective of the final outcome of his case before the civil courts.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(d) <span style="">Any </span>officer or <span style="">enlisted </span>man
who has re­turned to military control and performed regular duties pending the
trial or final determination of his case before the civil courts, shall be
entitled to receive pay and allowances during the period such duties have been
performed, irrespec­tive of the outcome of his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restoration <span style="">to, or relief from, full duty status of <u>officers and enlisted men
who have lawfully returned to mili­tary control or custody </u></span><u><span style="">pending </span></u><u><span style="">the trial or final determination of their cases </span><span style="">before the </span></u><u><span style="">civil courts</span></u><span style="">; shall be as directed by the Chief of Staff,
with the approval of the Secretary of National Defense:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That nothing herein shall be
construed as relieving the proper commanding officer or officers of military
personnel accused before the civil courts from the responsibility of <u>producing
the person of the accused at<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the time
and place<span style="">&nbsp; </span>required by the lawful order
of the proper civil<span style="">&nbsp; </span>authorities</u>."
(emphasis ours)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A perceptive analysis of the, foregoing provisions <span style="">of law </span>will yield
the inevitable conclusion that although the law consi­ders as proper the
transfer of an accused military personnel to the custody of the army
authorities for safe-keeping pending trial, just as inescapably is to be
implied from the said statu­tory enactments that the said transfer or
commitment is not compulsory since the same legislative enactments likewise re­cognize
the propriety of the accused remaining in the custody of the civil authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Legislature has thus impliedly retained in the civil courts
the full discretion, unimpaired and undiminished, <span style="">to de­</span>termine whether or not to resort
to the provisions of par. <span style="">4 of Executive </span>Order <span style="">106 </span>in
the proper cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be <span style="">so </span>be­cause the said precise
provisions of the said executive order have not been embodied in any statutory
enactment and are a mere part of Army regulations issued by the President as
com­mander-in-chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such regulations
are only directory, as far as <span style="">civil
courts are concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To this effect are the
following authoritative <span style="">comments of </span>Colonel
William Winthrop on pages 27 and 32 of his book entitled "Military Law and
Precedents," 2nd edition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The authority for army regulations proper is to be sought -
primarily - in the distinctive func­tions of the President as Commander-in-chief
and as Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His functions as
Commander-in-chief authorize him to issue, personally or through his military
subordinates, such orders and directions as are necessary and proper <span style="">to </span>ensure order and discipline in the
army."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x whether or not resting upon any express authority of
statute, the <u>legal effect</u> of army regulations - as of other regulations
proper is - <span style="">as already indicated,
simply that of executive, administrative, instrumental rules and directions as
distinguished from statutory enactment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">in­deed somewhat
loosely said of the army regulations </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">some </span><span style="">of the authorities,
that they have 'the force of but this expression is well explained by the court
in U. S. v. Webster, as follows: - 'When it is said that they have the force of
law, nothing more is meant than that they have that virtue when they are
consistent with the laws established by the Le­gislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to say, while they have a legal
force, it is a force quite distinct from, and inferior and subordinate to, that
of the statute law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The have the force
of law within their proper scope, not beyond it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are thus not law in the sense of be</span><span style="">ing </span><span style="">a part of the 'law of the land,' nor are they
<span style="">em</span>braced in the designation,
'laws of the United States,' but are law, and operative, as <u>regulations</u>
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As </span><span style="">such they are law to the army and those whom </span><span style="">they may concern, </span><span style="">and so far are binding and conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While regulations, 'intended for the
government and direction of officers and agents under his autho­rity, would not
legally restrain, in the exercise of his executive powers, the <u>President</u>,<i>
</i>or the head of the Department by whom the same were made, yet the
President, as well as any other executive offi­cial, would </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">so far bound by general regulations framed by him that he could not
justly except from their operation a particular case to which they ap­plied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The binding force and application to the army of the army
regulations is illustrated by the fact that a failure to observe a regulation
may constitute a military offence cognizable by court-martial under the 62d
art. of War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, officers
and soldiers, in complying with an authorized regulation, will be justified in
law and protected by the courts."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above time-tested and time-honored princi­ples, it
is our view, and we so hold, that while the provisions of par. 4 of Executive
Order 106 may bind the military compulsori­ly, they do not so bind the judicial
tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is any modicum of
judicial power vested in the military by the mere commitment of an accused to
his commanding officer for safe-keeping, for the duty of an officer in
executing the mandate of a judicial order "is purely ministerial, and his
power with respect thereto is limited to compliance with its terms."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That the provisions of
par. 4 of Executive Order 106 are not to be regarded as mandatory upon judicial
tribunals is like­wise compellingly inferred from the following portions of the
ex­planatory note to House Bill 1443, which later became Republic Act 1067 (<u>supra</u>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>“Military personnel awaiting trial before the civil courts, or the
result thereof, may or m<span style="">ay </span>not
be under military control; and those who return to military control may or may
not be present and available for their regular duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those de­tained by the civil authorities will
receive pay and allowances for the period of their absence only if they are
acquitted, or if the case is otherwise ter­minated without a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But so long as per­sons who have lawfully
returned to their units are placed on full duty status and are in the perform­ance
of their regular duties, the outcome of the case against them should have no
effect on their right to receive pay and allowances for the period during which
actual duty has been performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on
the other hand, if they have been prevented <span style="">from performing regular duties because of the pen­dency of such cases
against them, their right to receive pay and allowances for the period of such
absence from regular duties should logically de­pend upon the final outcome of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If convicted, their absence is
due to their fault; therefore, no pay accrues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The wisdom or desirability of placing such persons (who lawfully return
to mi­litary control) on full duty status, or of placing them under some form
of restraint pending their trial, will of course depend upon the gravity of the
offense, and likelihood of the accused's at­tempting to escape, and the
military exigencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is proposed to
leave the matter of the restora­tion to, or relief from, full duty status of
mili­tary personnel awaiting trial, to the discretion of the Chief of Staff and
the Secretary of National Defense alone. This discretion is for purposes of
determining the pay status of the accused only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been expressly provided that in no way can the exercise of this
discretion by the Chief of Staff relieve the commanding officer of the accused
(who is under </span><span style="">mi</span><span style="">litary control or custody) of the duty of
producing the accused when lawfully required by the proper civil
authorities."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the provisions of par. 4 of Executive Order 106, we repeat,
are to be construed as merely directory upon the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated elsewise, in a case where the offense
charged is bailable, a civil court, with respect to the commitment of the
accused, <u>may,</u> in the proper exercise of its discretion, <u>avail</u> of
the provisions of par. 4 of Executive Order 106, as an <u>alternative recourse</u>
for the commitment of the accused and his <span style="">custody </span>and safe-keeping until acquitted or convicted by final
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the case at bar, we hold that the provisions of
par. 4 of Executive Order 106 have no application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused are charged with murder, which is
a capital offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No bail was
recommended by the City Fiscal when he filed the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was any formal application for bail ever
made by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even <span style="">if </span>we
regard the repeated petitions of the accused <span style="">for their </span>commitment, pending trial, to their commanding officer
as, cons­tructively, petitions for bail, what the respondent <span style="">court should </span>have priorly done was to
determine, in accord <span style="">with the pertinent
</span>provisions of the Rules of Court, whether the evidence <span style="">of guilt </span>against the said accused is
strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On an affirmative finding, the
respondent court cannot avail of the provisions of par. <span style="">4 of Exe­</span>cutive Order 106, as this paragraph, we have already <span style="">held, is ap</span>plicable only to offenses
which are bailable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the finding of the respondent court, embodied in its
order of August 4, 1970, that "the evidence so far presented by the
prosecution, if not contradicted and rebutted <span style="">by </span>evidence of <span style="">the
defense, is sufficient to <u>convict the two accused beyond a rea­sonable doubt</u>,"
which means, in essence, that the evidence of guilt is strong, the questioned
order of the respondent court dated August 6, 1970 directing the re-delivery of
the two accused to their commanding officer for custody and safe-keeping,
pending trial, is clearly a nullity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the present petition is granted; the chal­lenged
order of the respondent Circuit Criminal Court dated Aug­ust 6, 1970 is hereby
annulled and set aside; and the said respon­dent Court is hereby directed to
forthwith order the commitment of the two respondents-accused, Major Felipe U.
Carreon, Jr. and Cpl. Sergio Atwil, to the city jail of Iligan, or, if the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision reached by this Court is to grant the writ of
certiorari prayed for, the challenged order of <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1970</st1:date> being thereby annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am fully in agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be acknowledged likewise, that the opinion
of the Court penned by Justice Castro, is notable for the meticulous care with
which both the relevant facts and the applicable law is appraised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were a question solely of whether or
not paragraph 4 of Executive Order No. 106, Series of 1937, as tested by
applicable principles of statutory construction would govern, then full
concurrence would not be inappropriate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of the fact, however, "that respondent Judge did feel bound
to submit to such <span style="">a </span>provision, and even petitioner, as noted in the opinion of the
Court, did not impugn its validity, I feel constrained to write a separate
opinion to express the grave and serious doubt I enter<span style="">tain concerning the power of the President to include in the aforesaid
Executive Order such a requirement by virtue of his prerogative as
Commander-in-Chief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be admitted that under the Constitution now in force,
the President of the Philippines, in the language of Justice Laurel, "is
endowed with broad <span style="">and extraordinary
powers" and "is expected to govern </span>with a firm and steady hand
without vexatious or embarrassing interference and much less dictation from any
source * * *.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Moreover,
there has been no reluctance on the part of this Court to recognize the wide
ambit of authority possessed by him as commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there is no
justification consistent with the principle of the supremacy of the
Constitution for any <span style="">assertion of any <span class="GramE">prerogative, that</span> would infringe on the fundamental
principle of separation of powers and would contravene the dearly-cherished
concept of civilian supremacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most
serious reflection has convinced me that questions of such a character are
unavoidably raised by virtue of such a command in Executive Order No. 106,
Series of 1937 to which obeisance <span style="">was </span>paid
by respondent Judge.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The paragraph in question appearing in Executive Order No. 106,
Series of 1937, is quite explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tone is imperative, the language one of command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No wonder the lower <span class="GramE">court</span>
acted as it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have felt that
it had no choice on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
such an attitude is erroneous does not argue against the apparently peremptory
character of such paragraph. </p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">Wisely has the Constitution vested in the
Presidency control over all executive departments, bureaus and <span class="GramE">offices.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
thus as he and he alone is the Executive.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He has the final say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So adherence to
the fundamental principle of separation of powers requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is but right and proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for him, though, to exercise
control over judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They belong to <span style="">a </span>separate and independent
department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any such attempt would be
lacking in support in our consti­tutional scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be not to honor but to disregard
the basic concept of coordinate and equal branches of govern­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, the matter of granting bail
and the effects thereof do appertain to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the Constitution in express language
ordains.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in that sense that I find extreme difficulty in accepting the view that
the judiciary is even called upon to take notice of the aforesaid paragraph. </p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">Respondent Judge, however, was entirely of
a different mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As above noted, he
accorded it more than clue deference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a result, he was much too generous in the appraisal of its terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not too much to say that he did thus
convert his <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> into what Justice Laurel referred to
as a "<span class="SpellE">receptacular</span> agency" into which may
flow whatever the Executive in his wisdom may pour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, that is' not in accordance with
the doctrine of separation of powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Perhaps though respondent Judge cannot be blamed overmuch.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be that he is the victim of a system
that tolerates executive guidance and supervision over inferior courts even if <span style="">in </span>the
guise of its being limited to administrative matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result as unfortunately did happen here
is one of judicial abdication. </p>

<p class="NUM">2. It may be out of excess of caution, but I am likewise bothered
by the thought that the paragraph in question appears to run counter to the
equally cardinal postulate of civilian supremacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its source is traceable to the powers of the
President over the armed forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not for this Court, of <span style="">course, </span>to
curtail the vast scope of authority that is rightfully <span style="">his </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Commander-in-Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is equally well-settled, however, that
there should be no unwarranted extension of such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the matter
involved were limited to the appropriate discipline of the members of the
defense establishment, the President should have his way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could be no question as to the
correctness of what was ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
not, however, limited to that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
wording, mandatory in character, would place the judiciary, at least on the
trial court level, in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">subordinate
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would be compelled to
grant officers and men of the military establishment, solely because of their
status </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">such, a distinct privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not their predicament as <span class="SpellE">indictees</span> but their enrollment in the ranks of the military
that is to prove decisive </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to
where they would be confined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find
difficulty then in resisting the conclusion of its repugnancy to the concept of
civilian supremacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A quotation from
former Chief Justice Warren is illuminating:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Thus it is plain that the axiom of subordination of the military
to the civil is not an anachronism.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, 'it is so deeply rooted in our national experience that it must,
be regarded as an essential constituent of the fabric of our political
life."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. This is not to impugn the good faith of President <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> in issuing the aforesaid provision in the Executive
Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be conceded that such a
move must have been prompted by what he considered to be the best interest of
public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor can it be gainsaid
that there could have been compelling consider<span style="">ations from the standpoint of military discipline and prestige of the
officers and members of the armed forces that called for a measure of this
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undoubted, however,
that the </span>only <span style="">question before
the courts is one of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether
wisdom or <span class="SpellE">unwisdom</span> resides in the act or executive
order under scrutiny is not pertinent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To repeat, it is die existence of authority that is crucial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it to be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be shown to exist, whether by express
grant or by necessary implication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
principle applies to every one in officialdom from the highest to the
lowest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I am correct in my
assumption, the commander-in-­chief clause </span>does not <span style="">lend support to such assertion of
competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is </span>not <span style="">to be lost sight of that the Constitution is
not only a source of power but imposes limits beyond </span>which <span style="">it </span>cannot go, <span style="">again whether categorically set forth or by way of necessary </span>implication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a truism that unlimited power is not
conferred on any public official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Constitution saw to that; it must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is paramount and binding on all in the government service, the
President not excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only thus may
its supremacy be upheld. </p>

<p class="NUM">4. Before closing, may I refer to statements in the opinion of
Justice Castro which are worth <span class="GramE">commending.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "The Legislature has thus
impliedly retained in the civil courts the full discretion, unimpaired and
undiminished, to determine whether or not to resort to the provisions of par. 4
of Executive Order 106 in the proper cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This must be so because the said precise provisions of the said<span style=""> executive order have not been embodied in
any statutory enactment and are a mere part of Army regulations issued by the
President </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">commander-in-chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such regulations are only directory, as far
as civil courts are concerned." Also:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Applying the above time-tested and time-honored principles, it is
our view, and we so hold, that while the provisions of par. 4 of Executive
Order 106 may bind the military compulsorily, they do not so bind the judicial
tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is any modicum of
judicial power vested in the military by the mere commitment of an accused to
his commanding officer for safe-keeping, for the duty of an officer in
executing the mandate of a judicial order 'is purely ministerial, and his power
with respect thereto is limited to compliance with its terms.'"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, they are steps in the right
direction, but for reasons which for me are of decisive weight, I </span><span style="">mast say </span><span style="">that they do not go far enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this brief concurring opinion. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
