dismissal of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pam­panga</span>,
are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1961</st1:date>,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Maria Castor entered into a
Contract of Lease (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A" of the
Complaint) over a piece of land located in <span class="SpellE">Dulong</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paligui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Candaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, containing
more or less 950,000 square meters.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By letter dated February 5, 1964<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Acting Di­rector of Public Works, <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>
and Castor were in­formed that they were granted water rights on January 17,
1964 by the Secretary of Public Works, after due hearing and as recommended by
the Bureau of Public Works, enabling them to draw water from the <span class="SpellE">Maasim</span> River, otherwise known as the <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span>
Pare River, which is adjacent to the above mentioned property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for this purpose they were autho­rized to
construct the necessary structures, including an earth dam.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Pursuant to this authority, <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Castor
caused the construction of an earth dam across said river in order to impound
sufficient water to enable them to plant and irrigate the plants and crops in
said land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Sta. Maria
and Federico <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas caused the construction of
another earth dam across the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Maasim</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> about <i>a </i>kilometer up­stream
from the dam constructed by <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Castor and
adjacent to the latter's property.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Castor on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1964</st1:date> filed a complaint
for actual, moral and exemplary damages, 6% in­terest thereon, and 20% of the
sum due as attorney's fees, alleging that despite their repeated demands Sta.
Maria and <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas refused and failed to remove
said erected dam nor to release any water from said river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged actual damages suffered by <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> total P28,984.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1964</st1:date>,
defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and after its denial, they filed their
answer with counterclaim on <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs filed
their answer to the counterclaim on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="10">October
 26, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiffs filed a request for admission addressed to defendants thru the
latter's coun­sel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by
defendants with general and un­specific denials on <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court on <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1964</st1:date> issued an order denying plaintiffs' request for admission
and setting the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1964</st1:date>, plaintiffs filed a
motion for reconsideration of said order and for the postponement of the
scheduled hear­ing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1964</st1:date>,
the lower court issued an order reconsidering its order of <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1964</st1:date>, and decree­ing that the
request for admission and opposition thereto be retained in the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1965</st1:date> filed a motion for summary judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by defendants on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="2">Feb­ruary 5, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1965</st1:date>,
the lower court issued an order denying the plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs moved to reconsider
this order on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1965</st1:date>,
but the lower court denied said motion on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1965</st1:date> and set the case for hearing on the merits
on <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Castor
elevated the matter to this Court in a petition for certiorari and prohibition
with prayer for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date> We
dismissed the petition on the ground that appeal in due time was the proper remedy.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration in said case was likewise denied by Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1965</st1:date>,
plaintiffs' counsel, with the con­formity of defendants' counsel, moved for the
postponement of the hearing scheduled for <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1965</st1:date> on the ground that he was scheduled to leave
for abroad on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1965</st1:date>
and would not be back until <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="7">July 10,
 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1965</st1:date>,
the lower court ordered the dismissal of the complaint as well as defendants'
counterclaim for failure to prosecute, without pronouncement as to costs, on
the ground that when the case was called in the morning of that date neither
the parties nor their respective coun­sel appeared, notwithstanding notice to
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs' motion to reconsider on the above order was denied by
the lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="8">August
 3, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants in their brief would raise two points:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Did the lower court err in denying
plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(2) Did the lower court err in dismissing the suit for failure to prosecute?</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants cannot properly raise the first point, for their
failure to state in their notice of appeal that they ere likewise appealing
from the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1965</st1:date>
denying their motion for summary judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The notice of appeal shall specify the
parties to the appeal; <u>shall designate the judgment or, order or part,
thereof</u>, <u>appealed from</u>, and shall specify the court to which appeal
is taken." (Underscoring supplied) It is to be noted that the word <u>shall</u>
is used thrice, obviously to lend emphasis to the mandatory nature of the
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is as it should
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For otherwise, if the party
appealing is free to question on appeal even orders not included in the notice
of appeal, the parties and the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> would be at a loss in
determining which orders are appealed and which are not, for purposes of
execution of orders not included in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the other point, however, plaintiffs-appellants seasonably
filed a motion for postponement which was received by the clerk of the lower
court four (4) days before the scheduled hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
counsel agreed to said postponement, as evidenced by his <span class="SpellE"><u>conforme</u></span>
appearing at the foot of said motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> And
it was plaintiffs’ first motion exclusively for postponement, because their two
other motions for postponement, filed on December 8, 1964 and April 23, 1965,
were incidental to their request for admission and their motion for summary
judgment respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, said
motion for postpone­ment had an impelling reason, plaintiffs' counsel had to
go, and did go abroad, in his professional capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not filed to delay or gain time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is not entirely the parties' fault that the case was
not earlier set for hearing, because the lower court <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> cancelled the hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1965</st1:date> in order to attend
the convention of all judges held in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the plaintiffs-appellants had only
one counsel and therefore the absence of their lawyer left them without counsel
in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the allowance or denial of petitions for
postponement and the setting aside of orders previous­ly issued, rest
principally upon the sound discretion of the judge to whom they are addressed,
but always predicated on the consideration that more than the mere convenience
of the courts or of the parties of the case, he ends of justice and fairness
would be served thereby.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
When no substantial rights are affected and the intention to delay is not
manifest, the corresponding motion to transfer the hearing having been filed
accordingly, it is sound judicial discretion to allow them.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, through counsel,
having given their conformity to the postponement asked for by the ap­pellants,
it is safe to, assume that no damage or prejudice would be suffered by them
because of said postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, neither they nor their counsel likewise appeared on the date
set for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is hereby reversed and
set aside and the case is remanded to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for further
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to
costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
