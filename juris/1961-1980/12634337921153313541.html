<p class="BODY">The fourteen year old son of the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Gonzales, <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales, together with his younger
brother, 3-year old Allan, were with the victim on March 3, 1971, at about 7:00

barrio San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,
walking on the trail going to their home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales carried 3-year old
Allan and <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales walked beside his
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came from the store of <span class="SpellE">Isias</span> <span class="SpellE">Agesta</span> where they exchanged
vinegar for empty bottles.</p>

<p class="BODY">While walking, the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Gonzales was suddenly approached from behind by Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>
who appeared by the wayside and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> at the back
the victim who fell forward and thus his 3-year old son Allan was thrown away
from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two other accused <span class="SpellE">Ernito</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, who also suddenly appeared simultaneously with
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> from the wayside, took turns with
Reynaldo in striking the fallen victim with their fighting bolos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the victim fell, fourteen year old <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales took hold of his three year old brother
Allan and ran away to the cane fields to escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fourth accused <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> likewise appeared in the scene and with his
fighting bolo also struck blows, together with Reynaldo, <span class="SpellE">Ernito</span>
and Bernardo, at the prostrate victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused tried immediately
afterwards to run after <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> and Allan Gonzales but
the latter two disappeared among the sugar cane planted by the fields on the
wayside. The four accused then ran away.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

aforementioned incident, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Benjamin, who was
then in the vicinity, very near where the crime occurred, watching his sugar
cane from a cane car, saw the offense committed, and when <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Benjamin saw what was happening he hid behind the cane car so that the four
accused did not notice his presence.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Gonzales, with his brother Allan, ran to his house at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>

asked money from Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> and when the latter
pleaded that he had no money, victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Gonzales drew a locally made gun "<span class="SpellE">pugakhang</span>"
and threatened to shoot accused Reynaldo even if the latter refused to fight. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Gonzales was about to shoot Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, the
latter pushed <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
him between the eyes and nose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused then struck <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> with his bolo three

Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> of having stolen coconuts in the

the gun he allegedly grabbed from the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>

fishpond from morning up to afternoon and evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 4 and 5 he continued working in the
fishpond and went home only on Saturday afternoon. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He did not participate in the killing of
victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales because he has no grudge
against the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
he was his friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stayed at barrio <span class="SpellE">Botacol</span> temporarily and visited his family once a
week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aligno</span> corroborated the testimony of Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave much credence to the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Benjamin, who had no reason to testify falsely
against the four accused, and <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales who
testified in a simple straightforward manner as to how his father was suddenly
attacked and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> from behind by Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, followed by <span class="SpellE">Ernito</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> who <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> the fallen <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
Gonzales, and also by <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>
who used his bolo on the victim when the latter was prostrate and helpless.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court made a very careful scrutiny of evidence of both
the prosecution and the defense and found the evidence for the prosecution,
consisting of the unbiased testimony of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Benjamin who actually saw from a distance of three <span class="SpellE">brazas</span>
from his vantage point on a cane car the attack made by all the four accused,
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ernito</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> upon the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales, pointing out in detail the participation
of each of the four accused, and clearly identifying each, conclusively
established that the four accused participated in inflicting bolo wounds upon <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no evidence produced by the accused to show any reason why
witness <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Benjamin should testify against them
falsely, hence, he must be telling the truth.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
There has been established by the evidence, conspiracy among the accused by
reason of the ambush they perpetrated and the concerted simultaneous attack
they made on the victim, the four attackers suddenly coming out of the sugar
plantation, with great stealth and cunning on a moonlight night and attacking
the victim with bolos.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds no compelling reason to disturb the trial
court's findings on the credibility of witnesses who testified in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory of the defense that
accused Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> killed the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales in self-defense when the latter,
allegedly after giving wine to Reynaldo, drew his home-made gun and asked money
from Reynaldo, with a threat to kill him, is very difficult to believe,
unsupported as it is by any other evidence other than Reynaldo's testimony, and
in the face of the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Benjamin
and <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> could not even produce
the gun he was supposed to have taken from the victim and his explanation that
it was lost when he ran away hardly deserves credence.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> could not even explain why, if it
was true that he killed in self-defense, he did not report the matter
immediately to the barrio captain or the police authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version of the incident is likewise very
difficult to believe.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proven presence of numerous wounds, so many of them fatal, on
the body of the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales eloquently
manifests the truth in the prosecution's version of the crime that the four
accused took turns in using their fighting bolos on the victim even when he was
already prostrate from the sudden attack of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>
who hit him from his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, himself, admitted that he was not on speaking
terms with the victim before the incident of March 3, 1971 and that there was a
grudge between <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales and Reynaldo because
three months before March 3, 1971, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> accused
Reynaldo publicly of stealing coconuts from the plantation where <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> was in charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, wittingly or
unwittingly, provided the motive for the sudden attack of the four accused on
the victim during the incident in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the defense that <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> was not really one of the assailants of the
victim on the evening of March 3, 1971, because <span class="SpellE">Chito</span>
Gonzales did not mention him in his affidavit<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> was not included in the original complaint,
is to Our mind not worthy of merit, because an examination of the sworn
statements of <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Benjamin<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
readily shows that <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales made no mention of <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> in his sworn
statement given to the police authorities immediately after the incident
because <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>
came to the scene and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> the fallen victim after <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales took his younger brother Allan and ran away
to hide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the narration of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Benjamin in his sworn statement, <span class="SpellE">Chito</span> Gonzales could not have seen the accused <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> striking the
victim with his bolo because that happened after <span class="SpellE">Chito</span>
Gonzales fled with his 3-year old brother from the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the two assignments of error allegedly
committed by the trial court because it correctly rejected the defense version
that accused Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> killed the victim <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Gonzales in legitimate self-defense, and in
finding that the other accused Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ernito</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roceval</span> <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span> participated in
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the evidence for
the prosecution conclusively established the qualifying circumstance of
treachery to qualify the killing to murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
This qualifying circumstance absorbs the aggravating circumstances of nighttime
and abuse of superior strength.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance in the
commission of the crime, the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from, being in accordance
with the law and the evidence, is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>
