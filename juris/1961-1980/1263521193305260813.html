<span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, from a decision of the Court of First Instance

S-159 and S-159-A thereof, finding him and his co-defendants, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> - who have not appealed -guilty as principals of two
(2) crimes of robbery with homicide - committed together with Miguel <span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span>, who has not been apprehended, as yet - and
sentencing <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span>

in the sum of P6,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in the event of

which <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> had interposed his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="12">December
 11, 1963</st1:date>, the dead bodies of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tracarol</span> and his wife Maxima <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>

</span>Various documents, several pieces of cloth­ing and other personal
effects (Exhibits H-1 to H-24, I and I-1 to 1-23), were scattered around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 100 meters away was a trunk (Exhibit H)

<span class="SpellE">Baroro</span> had, in turn, sustained "(1) Wound, stab,
3 inches long, left, base of neck" and "(2) Wound, incised, 3/4

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1963</st1:date>,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> and his co-defendants, <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>, were
arrested at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>wharf</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lazi</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, as they were about to
board a boat for <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon investigation, <span class="SpellE">Lumag­han</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> confessed that they had - together with
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cam­pomanis</span>, and accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, who refused to make any state­ment - killed the
aforementioned couple, incidentally to their (defend­ants') design to steal
from them (Mr. &amp; Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tracarol</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These con­fessions were taken down by the
local chief of police, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>, and then
subscribed and sworn to before the municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lazi</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, two (2) criminal complaints had been filed with the municipal
court of <span class="SpellE">Lazi</span>, first for robbery with double murder
and later for robbery in band with double murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the corresponding preliminary
investigation, the two (2) cases were forwarded to the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, where the provincial fiscal filed
two (2) separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for robbery with
homicide, one involving the killing of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tracarol</span> and another, that of his wife, Maxima <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
joint trial, under a plea of not guilty, said court of first instance <span class="GramE">rendered</span> its afore­said decision, from which defendant <span class="SpellE">Pelicolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> appealed to the
Court of Appeals, which, in turn, certified both cases to Us, in view of the
penalties meted out.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution - consisting of the confessions,
Exhibits C, C-1 to C-5, D and D-1, the aforementioned physical evidence
(Exhibits H, H-1 to H-24, I and I-1 to I-23) and the testimony of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangquenza</span>, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Sangquenza</span>, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Paghasian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> <span class="SpellE">Juma­lon</span>, Adriano <span class="SpellE">Bonocan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Omandam</span> - tended to establish the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a party at <span class="SpellE">Buloran</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on Novem­ber
27, 1963, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Cam­pomanis</span>
agreed to sail for <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, on December 3,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendants, together with
appellant <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, then boarded a vessel at <span class="SpellE">Lampanid</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day,
they arrived at <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thence, they <span class="GramE">proceeded</span>, the following day, to <span class="SpellE">Larena</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, which they reached on December
6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After taking some drinks at its
market­place, they resumed their journey and arrived at the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Capa­lasanan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lazi</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00
 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took their dinner
and spent the night in the house of Sergio <span class="SpellE">Pag­hasian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early the next morning, they went to <span class="SpellE">Calunasan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Maria</st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental, and slept in the house of the spouses Cesar and <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sangquenza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The day following, they merely relaxed, doing nothing of particular
relevance to the cases at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
morning, they went to a house in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>, in
connection with the town fiesta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, that evening, they tried to go elsewhere, but, were unable
to do so, having arrived late for the bus that would have taken them to their
destination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, accordingly, returned
to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Sangquenzas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following evening, <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> slept
in the house of one by the name of <span class="SpellE">Pecoy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> remained in that of
the <span class="SpellE">Sangquenzas</span>, the next day, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time>, the four (4) of them got together
and headed for the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Capalasanan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lazi</span>, which they reached at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
went directly to the place where <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tracarol</span> and his wife Maxima <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>
lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching their yard, <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> took <span class="SpellE">Dionisio's</span> cow from
where it was and tethered it to a corner under his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
came down with a lighted torch, seemingly to ascertain what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
passed near a coconut tree, behind which <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> had
taken cover, the latter hit him on the back of the neck with the stem <span style="">of a coconut palm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
screamed, saying that he was being </span>killed, <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>
covered his (<span class="SpellE">Dionisio's</span>) mouth with the palm of his (<span class="SpellE">Magaso's</span>) hand, whereas <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span>
hit <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> with another stem of coconut palm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attracted by <span class="SpellE">Dionisio's</span>
scream, his wife, Maxima <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>, had, meanwhile, gone
to the window of their house and seen that he was being beaten up, whereupon
she, likewise, began to scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
induced <span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span> to go up the house and stab her
twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span>
came down and, similarly, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, who was
still shouting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After thus silencing
him, <span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span> went back to the house, together with
<span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span>, and then brought down a trunk, which <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> helped them bring some distance away, and then pry
it open with a hunting knife, to find - after throwing out its contents,
consisting of documents, pieces of clothing and other personal effects - that
there was no money inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While these
events were transpiring, appellant <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> watched or
stood guard on the yard, holding a stone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Each one of the defendants, however, set up his own alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> said that he
was, at the time of the occurrence, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Candaping</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> would have <span class="GramE">Us</span> believe that he had never been at the scene of the crime
and that, since his arrival from <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>, he had
been in the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Larena</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
where his grandparents were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
other hand, <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> limited himself to denying his
guilt, stating that his extra-judicial confession had been obtained thru
duress, and that his sole purpose in coming from <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> was to harvest coconuts from the plantation
of his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> <span class="SpellE">Jumalon</span>,
in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Candanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Siquijor</span>,
in order to raise funds, with the pro­ceeds of the sale of said coconuts, to
pay for the hospitalization of a sick brother.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, We are satisfied that - contrary to the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> -
the extra-judicial confessions, Exhibits C, C-1 to C-5, and D to D-1, had been
freely and voluntarily made by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, this fact was established by the testimony of police <span class="GramE">chief</span> Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Baroro</span>, who took
said confessions, and that of Muni­cipal Mayor <span class="SpellE">Arcamo</span>,
before whom said confessions were subscribed and sworn to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> to the effect that he had informed his godfather, <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> <span class="SpellE">Omandam</span>, of the duress
under which his confession had allegedly been obtained, was refuted by the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the confessions
corroborated each other, and the contents thereof were, in turn, corroborated
by the testimonies of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Sangquenza</span>, his wife <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangquenza</span>, and Sergio <span class="SpellE">Paghasian</span>, in whose houses said defendants and their
co-accused, including appellant <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, had stayed for
some time between Decem­ber 6 and 10, 1963, and by the presence, at the scene
of the occur­rence, of <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan's</span> hunting knife and
its scabbard, Exhibits A and A-1, the scabbard Exhibit B of <span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Magaso's</span> dagger and its scabbard, Exhibits E and E-1,
the stems of coconut palms, Exhibits F and F-1, the trunk, Exhibit H, and the
documents, gar­ments and other personal effects, Exhibits H-1 to H-24, I and
I-1 to I-23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Paghasian</span> identified the hunting knife, Exhibit A and its
scabbard, Exhibit A-1, the first having been used by <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span>
<span style="">when he slaughtered a dog and skinned
the same, while he and his co-defendants were in the house of said witness, on
December 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paghasian</span>,
likewise, identified the scabbard, Exhibit B, as that of the hunting knife used
by defendant <span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span>, when he assisted <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> in the task aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the fact that both <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> have not
appealed from the decision of the trial court, convicting them as charged,
implies an acknowledgment of their guilt and belies their plea of innocence, as
well as their respective alibis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, apart from the <span class="SpellE">Sangquenzas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pag­hasian</span>, Adriano <span class="SpellE">Bonocan</span>
asserted positively that he had seen <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, together
with <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and a
fourth person - not in the courtroom during the trial - in <span class="SpellE">Capalasanan</span>,
on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="12"><span style="">December 7, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the following facts appear to have been duly established,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Campomanis</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>, had,
on November 27, agreed to and did sail from Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on
December 3, as well as proceed to the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lazi</span>,
for the purpose of robbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
trip, they were accompanied by ap­pellant <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, who
was together with them continuously, not only from December 3 to 10, when the
crime charged was committed, but, even, subsequently thereto, or up to December
14, when <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span> were apprehended at the wharf of <span class="SpellE">Lazi</span>, as they were about to board a vessel, to sail
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>
was not merely present when the crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood guard, armed with a piece of stone,
which he held with one hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did or
said nothing to indicate his disapproval of the acts of vandalism <span style="">committed by his companions upon a
defenseless old couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, he
remained in the company of <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>, until the three (3) of them were arrested on
December 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts suffice to
establish conspiracy between <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> and his
co-defendants to commit the crimes adverted to above, and to hold him responsi­ble
as a co-principal in the commission thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, also, that here we have two (2) cases and two
(2) convictions for robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, however, that there had been, in fact, no more than one (1)
robbery, which was the main purpose of the offenders; it follows that they have
committed only one crime of robbery with homicide<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
- that of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tracarol</span>
- apart from that of homicide of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Traca­rol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty for the first is life
imprisonment to death, which should be imposed in its maximum period, or death,
the offense having been committed in the dwelling of the offended parties, as
well as at nighttime and with the aid of armed men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of the number of votes necessary for
the imposition of the extreme penalty, that next lower in degree, or life
imprisonment, meted <span style="">out by the lower
court in L-27999 is imposable therein to appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelicolo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards L-28000, the crime committed is homicide, and, in view
of the circumstances already adverted to, the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
prescribed by law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, should be meted out in
its maximum period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as <span class="SpellE">Pelicolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>
is concerned, the decision appealed from should, accordingly, be modified in
the sense:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that only one robbery
with homicide has been committed, aside from another crime of homicide; (2)
that appellant should be sentenced, for the robbery with homicide, to life
imprisonment with the correspond­ing accessory penalties and, for the crime of
homicide, to an indeterminate penalty ranging from ten (10) years and one (1)
day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> to seventeen (17)
years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
likewise, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;
and (3) that his civil liability, jointly and severally with <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>, should be
increased from P6,000 to P12,000 in each case, or P24,000 altogether,
considering that two (2) persons had been killed,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> although,
not having appealed from the decision of the trial court, the civil
responsibility of <span class="SpellE">Lumaghan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magaso</span>
can not exceed the sum therein fixed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus modified, as to the characterization of one of the crimes
committed and the criminal and civil liabilities <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
of appel­lant <span class="SpellE">Pelicolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>,
the appealed decision is hereby affirmed, in all other respects, with the costs
