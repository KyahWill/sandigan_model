				[ G. R. No. L-22352, June 30, 1966</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP OF ENGRACIO CHAN ALSO KNOWN AS NICASIO LIM, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the decision of the
Court of First Instance of Pampanga granting appellee's petition for
naturalization, the Solicitor General appealed and now submits that the
petition should have been denied because, among other reasons, (1)
petitioner does not have a lucrative income; (2) he failed to allege in
his petition all his places of residence, past and present; and (3) he
is illegally using an alias.

  <p>Petitioner's evidence shows that he was born of Chinese
parents on November 25, 1940 in Manila, where he resided from birth
until 1946, when he transferred to Bacolor, Pampanga. He finished his
primary education in St. Mary's Academy, Bacolor, Pampanga, and the
intermediate grades and high school course at St. Ferdinand Academy,
San Fernando, Pampanga. He speaks and writes English, Tagalog and
Pampango. At present he is a salesman at the Caniogan Sari-sari and
Grocery Store, located in Pasig, Rizal, from which he receives a
monthly salary of P200, with free board and lodging.</p>
  <p>The
Solicitor General correctly points out that appellee does not have a
lucrative income as required by the Naturalization Law. Even for an
unmarried man like appellee, who has nobody dependent on him, a monthly
income of P200, with free board and lodging, is not considered gainful
employment (Yap <i>vs</i>. Republic, L-20372, May 14, 1966).</p>
  <p>Petitioner's
true name is Engracio Chan, but he has been using the name Nicasio Lim
since he started his schooling. Thus he is Engracio Chan in his birth
certificate and Nicasio Lim in all his school records. There is no
proof that he is legally authorized to use an <i>alias,</i> and his use thereof, being in violation of the Anti-Alias Law, is indicative of reproachable conduct.</p>
  <p>The foregoing circumstances, without more, disqualify him from acquiring Filipino citizenship by naturalization.</p>
  <p>The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed, and the petition is denied, with costs against appellee. </p>
  <p><i>Concepcion, C. J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar</i> and <i>Sanchez, JJ.</i>, concur. </p>
