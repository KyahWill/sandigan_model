<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petition for a writ of certiorari 
to annul and set aside a writ of preliminary injunction (Petition Annex "C") 
issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del 
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, in its Civil Case No. 11 (New), at the instance 
of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Hay Logging Co., Inc., 
and enjoining the defendants (petitioners in this Court) <span class="SpellE">Layno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span> and Young Men Labor 
Union Stevedores (Petition, Annex "C") to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="GramE">individually</span> and as a group, and AM. their agents, laborers 
or other men as groups of men having <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with 
them, desist under penalty of the law, from threatening, preventing, interfering 
or molesting in any manner whatsoever, the plaintiff and the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Co., Inc., the 
corporation which the latter has contracted to under take its work, in the 
towing and loading of export lops and lumber of the said plaintiff, and or 
unloading its cargoes, and particularly the towing and loading of 1,700,000 
board feet of logs on the SS HOHNAN MARU. This order shall continue in full 
force and effect with respect to other vessels which in the future may be 
chartered by the said plaintiff for loading export logs or lumber until this 
present case for injunction will have born finally determined by this 
Court."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case started in the court 
below with a complaint of the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Co., 
Inc., charging that defendants (petitioners in this Court), through threats-and 
intimidation, demanded that the corporation cancel its existing stevedoring 
contract with the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Co., Inc., so that the men affiliated to the Young 
Men Labor Union should undertake the loading of export logs and lumber of the 
company on the SS "<span class="SpellE">Hohnan</span> <span class="SpellE">Maru</span>", defendants further threatening to prevent the 
plaintiff from exporting its logs, abetted by defendant <span class="SpellE">Layno</span>, town mayor, who threatened to use the town police in 
favor of the Union, to the irreparable damage of plaintiff. The <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Co., Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> employed workers affiliated with the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Workers' 
</span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Union</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Answering the petition, 
defendants alleged that the logging company "avails itself of services of 
stevedores who are members of (a) company dominated union"; that as the permit 
issued in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Workers' Union had already expired, defendant <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span>, as officer of the 
Young Men Labor Union advised the Workers federation that "henceforth the 
defendant legitimate labor organization (i.e. the Young Men Labor Union) would 
Undertake the loading of the plaintiff's logs on board any ship or vessel coming 
to <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>; and averred "that 
the defendants never committed any threats or intimidation or an unlawful acts 
prior to the filling of the case"; that plaintiff Company discriminated against 
members of the defendant labor union in regard to employment of laborers or 
stevedores. Subsequently, defendants below filed an urgent motion to dissolve 
the writ of preliminary injunction, alleging lack of jurisdiction in the issuing 
court, that the case was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of 
Industrial Relations, and that the procedure laid down in Section 9 (d) of 
Republic Act No. 875 had not been followed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After hearing "the evidence 
calculated to bring the matter within the purview of Section 9, R. A. 875", and 
finding that there were existing contracts between the <span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Company and the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Company, Inc., 
and between the latter and the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Workers' Union, the court below declined to lift 
the injunction "subject to better proof during the trial on the merits of this 
case". A motion to reconsider having been subsequently denied also, the 
defendants resorted to this Supreme Court for relief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petition filed in this 
Supreme Court raises the question of the validity of the injunction, it being 
contended that the same was improper for lack of jurisdiction and non-observance 
of the conditions prescribed by section 9 of the Industrial Peace Act (R. A. No. 
875). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find no merit in the petition. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A striking feature of this case 
is that the record fails to show any demand whatever made by petitioners herein 
on the employees regarding terms or conditions of work. The defendant's answer 
in the court below (Annex "B" of the petition), which formed the basis of its 
motion to lift the preliminary injunction, averred merely a notice on the rival 
<span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Workersâ€™ 
Union, that the petitioning Young Men Labor Union would henceforth take the work 
of loading and unloading logs on the ships, but did not claim any demand or 
notice being made on respondent Logging Company nor on the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Company other 
than that its members be substituted for those of the Union With which a 
contract existed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other words, what the 
petitioners herein asked was not a change in working terms or conditions, or the 
representation of the employees, but that its members be hired as stevedores in 
the place of the members of the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Workers' Union, which petitioners wanted discharged 
notwithstanding the existing contracts of the <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> 
Company with the latter union, as expressly found by the trial court. It is 
difficult to see how such a demand can be considered a labor dispute as the same 
is defined in section 2 of the Industrial Peace Act (Associated Flour Haulers 
vs. Sullivan, 5 NYS 2nd, 982, 985; <span class="SpellE">Lauf</span> vs. E. G. 
<span class="SpellE">Shinner</span> &amp; Co., 82 Fed. 2d, 68; United Electrical 
Coal Companies vs. Rice, 80 Fed. 2d, 1; Fitzgerald vs. Dillon, 92 Fed. <span class="GramE">Supp., 681).</span> As pointed out in Donnelly Garment Co. vs. 
International Ladies' Garment Workers' </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Union</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 21 Fed. Supp. 807, the 
definitions of "labor disputes" in the Act must be confined to cases involving 
that exercise of freedom of action of employees dealt with by the declared 
public policy of protecting employees in their freedom of association and in the 
designation of bargaining representatives. In the present case, the Young Men 
Labor Association made no demands for better terms or conditions of work; for 
aught that appears of record it was satisfied with those already existing. 
Neither did it seek the right to represent the workers already employed; on the 
contrary, it wanted them discharged and replaced by its own members. Such being 
the case, there is no controversy over terms, tenure or conditions of 
employment, or over representation of employees that called for the application 
of the Industrial Peace Act. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With regard to the alleged unfair 
labor practice of discriminating in favor of workers affiliated to the <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Workers Union, it stands to reason that a mere 
charge or allegation to that effect does not suffice to oust the jurisdiction of 
the Court of First Instance any more than a simple averment that "no labor 
dispute exists" would suffice to confer it. There is total absence of evidence 
that the acts complained of were actually committed, or that an unfair labor 
practice charge has been made, or is actually pending, in the Court of 
Industrial Relations. None of these requirements is shown by the petitioners; in 
truth, it is averred by the respondents herein, and is not denied, that 
petitioners submitted no evidence in the Court of First Instance to support 
their motion to lift the injunction; and the allegation is confirmed by the 
absence of any reference in the petition to evidence produced before the trial 
court. The very same thing can be stated of the alleged expiration of the permit 
of the <span class="SpellE">Diatagon</span> <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> 
Workers' </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Union</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and that the latter was company 
dominated: no proof was submitted to substantiate the charge. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the petition for certiorari is 
dismissed, with costs against petitioners. The writ of preliminary injunction 
prayed for not having been issued, because of failure of petitioners to post the 
requisite bond, no dissolution thereof is required. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
