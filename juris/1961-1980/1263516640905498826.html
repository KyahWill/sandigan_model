<blockquote>"The undersigned accuses <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacquiao</span> of the crime of Robbery with Homicide, committed
as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 18th day of Feb­ruary 1963, at about
10:00 o'clock in the evening, in the municipality of San Fernando, province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above named accused together with one <span class="SpellE">Sofonias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span> who is still at large and who shall be
prosecuted also when arrested, conspiring and confederating together and
helping one another, armed with firearm and a scythe and with disguise by half
covering their faces, with intent of gain and with force, violence and
intimidation, did then and there willful­ly, unlawfully and feloniously, enter
the dwelling or house of <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sebial</span>
thru the kitchen and once inside shot the latter, pointed their firearm at the
occupants there­of and demanded from them money and other valuables, thereafter
ransacked the house and without the consent of the owner took and carried away
a transistor radio worth P180.00 and cash in the amount of P100.00 to the
damage and prejudice of the owner, the family of said <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sebial</span> in the total amount of P280.00; that on the
occasion of the said robbery and in order to insure success of their purpose,
the said accused in pursuance of their conspiracy, with intent to kill and with
evident premeditation, trea­chery and taking advantage of night time, superior
number, strength and the use of their firearm, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously attack and shot the said <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sebial</span> while the latter was asleep, thereby
inflicting upon him:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Upon being arraigned on </span><st1:date month="5" day="17" year="1963"><span style="color: windowtext;">May 17, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, both defendants pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, at the hearing called on the 30th of
the same month and year, their counsel de <span class="SpellE">parte</span>
stated in open court that <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> was willing to
withdraw his former plea of not guilty and thereafter to plead guilty, provided
the court would allow him to prove the mitigating circumstances of extreme
poverty and lack of instruction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
been allowed to withdraw his previous plea of not guilty and thereafter arraigned
anew, <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> pleaded guilty and was sentenced as
stated above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The other defendant, <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacquiao</span>, after trial, was
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from four (4) years and two (2)
months of <span class="SpellE">prisión</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
to ten (10) years of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor, to indemnify the
offended party in the sum of P100.00 (the money in cash that was stolen),
jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> with his co-defendant, and to
pay one-third of the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Before the decision against <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
appearance on his behalf was made by Atty. I. V. <span class="SpellE">Binamira</span>,
who subsequently filed two motions for re­consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both were denied by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this instance, the brief submitted by the
same counsel on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> claims that the
lower court erred in imposing the capital punishment upon the latter <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that "his affidavit shows that he
was not the one who fired the fatal shot that killed the victim but it was <span class="SpellE">Sofonias</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is exclusively based upon the
sworn statement (now in the record as Ex­hibit C) made by <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span>
before Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Alfoja</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
P.C. Command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that
the same was presented as part of the testimony of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Alfoja</span>
and of the Justice of the Peace of San Fernando, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="color: windowtext;">, against the other defendant, <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacquiao</span>, to prove the latter's participation in the
conspiracy to commit the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that stage of the proceedings the case had
already been submitted as far as <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> was
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is obvious that,
with his plea of guilty, <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> was deemed to have
admitted all the facts and circumstances alleged in the information which, as a
matter of fact, was read to him twice before he entered his plea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="color: windowtext;">Pujinio’s</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;"> counsel further claims that although the latter
entered a plea of guilty he, however, explained to the court that it was <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span> who killed <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sebial</span>, end that, therefore, he should be found guilty only
of robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention finds
support only in the sworn statement mentioned heretofore and which, as already
stated, can not be considered in connection with <span class="SpellE">Pujinio's</span>
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">Moreover, even assuming that <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> testified to that effect, it would not justify a
finding that he was guilty only of robbery, for it is settled that one who
participated in the commission of the crime of robbery in connection with which
homicide was also committed - as in this case - will be equally guilty as
principal of the crime of robbery with homicide, unless there is clear evidence
that he tried to prevent the commission of the latter offense (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Morados</span>, 70 Phil., 558; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Carunungan</span>,
et al., G. R. No. L-13283, </span><st1:date month="9" day="30" year="1960"><span style="color: windowtext;">September 30, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">With respect to the propriety of
the penalty imposed by the lower court, it appears that the information charged
<span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span> with robbery with homicide, with the
attendance of seven aggravating circumstances, namely: evident premedi­tation,
treachery, nighttime, superior number and strength, commission of the offense
in the dwelling of the victim, use of disguise, and recidivism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the lower court considered
in his favor only the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty, and refused to
consider in his favor the mitigating circumstances of lack of instruction and
extreme poverty as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"But the other two mitigating circum­stances that he was
claiming in his <span class="GramE">favor,</span> namely (1) lack of instruction
and (2) extreme poverty, cannot be appreciated in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he has studied up to sixth
grade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is more than suf­ficient
schooling to give him a degree of instruction as to properly apprise him of
what is right and wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with
respect to poverty, he himself said that his mother owns real properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have gain­fully occupied himself by
working on these properties, if he cared to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, this accused once had an employment with the <span class="SpellE">Cal­tex</span> way back in the year 1960, which he lost when he
embarked on his carrier of crimina­lity by committing his first case of
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, he impoverished
himself and lost his gainful occupation by committing crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not driven to the commission of crimes
due to want and poverty (pp. 94-95, record)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">We agree with the lower court that
the two mitigating circumstances mentioned heretofore can not be considered in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Pujinio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="color: windowtext;">The offense having been committed
with six aggravat­ing circumstances - that of nighttime being absorbed in
treachery - and with only one mitigating circumstance to offset them, the
penalty provided by law should be imposed in its maximum degree - Death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="color: windowtext;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="color: windowtext;">, the decision under review is affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
