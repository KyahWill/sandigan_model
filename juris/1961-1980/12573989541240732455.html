				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for certiorari to set aside a decision of the Court of Appeals, 
dismissing the petition for a writ of quo warranto instituted by Quirico A. 
Abela against Braulio D. Avelino, the position subject of controversy between 
the two being that of secretary of the municipal board of Roxas City.
<p>On January 3, 1956 the municipal board of Roxas City approved a resolution 
appointing Quirico Abela secretary to the municipal board <i>to serve as such 
during the term of the members thereof</i>. The term provided for in the 
resolution for Abela corresponds with the provisions of Section 13 of the 
Charter of Roxas City which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 13. Appointment, salary and duties of Secretary of Board.â€”The Board 
shall have a secretary who shall be appointed by it to serve during the term of 
office of the members thereof. * * *".</p></blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the term of office of Abela was to coincide 
with the term of office of the municipal board, which is from the date of his 
appointment to December, 1959, on November 19, 1956, by majority vote, with the 
vice mayor voting to break the tie, the position of secretary to the municipal 
board, then held by petitioner Quirico A. Abela, was declared vacant and 
immediately thereafter Braulio D. Avelino was appointed to the same position by 
virtue of Resolution No. 24, Series 1956. On the same day, November 19, 1956, 
petitioner herein sent a telegraphic protest to President Ramon Magsaysay 
against his ouster from office without cause.</p>
<p>On April 11, 1957 an original petition for quo warranto was filed by 
petitioner before this Court, the case being docketed as G.R. No. L-12246, 
Quirico A. Abela vs. Braulio D. Avelino, et al. This petition was dismissed 
without prejudice to filing the action in the proper court of first instance. On 
April 24, 1957 a motion for reconsideration was presented by petitioner but the 
same was denied in an order dated April 29, 1957. Copy of this order was 
received by the petitioner herein on May 3, 1957.</p>
<p>On April 2, 1957 petitioner filed an application for the commutation of his 
accrued vacation and sick leaves. On May 25, 1957 he was cleared from his money 
and property accountability by the presiding officer of the municipal board. On 
May 28, 1957 he was also cleared of his money and property accountability by the 
city treasurer, and on the same day he received the compensation due him in the 
amount of P351.61, representing his accrued vacation and sick leaves.</p>
<p>More than two months thereafter he instituted the petition for quo warranto 
in the Court of First Instance of Capiz. The court of first instance declared 
petitioner herein, Quirico A. Abela, entitled to the position of secretary to 
the municipal board of Roxas City, to hold the said position until the 
expiration of his term of office on December 31, 1959. The decision orders the 
auditor of Roxas City, and the city treasurer, to pay his salary from November 
19, 1956 until his final reinstatement.</p>
<p>Against the above decision the case was appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
This Court set aside the judgment of the lower court and dismissed the petition. 
In arriving at its decision the Court of Appeals ruled as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By long usage in the Government service 'terminal leave' has a distinct 
meaning. It is applied for by, and is granted to, an employee separated from 
service by ouster or resignation. We believe the petitioner understood it in 
this sense when he filed his own application for terminal leave in which he 
stated, among others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'SIR: I have the honor to make application for 51 Calendar Days 
(Vacation/sick) under the provision of Commonwealth Act Nos. 220 and 490 from 
November 19, 1956 to January 8, 1957 inclusive. I intend to spend this leave in 
Roxas City. Commutation of vacation and sick leave standing to my credit 
incident to separation from the service effective Nov. 19, 1956 pursuant to the 
provisions of Rep. Act 611, as amended by Rep. 1081.' (p. 107 of Record) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The application was granted and the petitioner received the payments of the 
compensation due him in the amount of P351.61, as shown by the City Voucher 
dated May 28, 1957 (Exh. Q). Furthermore, it appears that the petitioner was 
cleared from his money and property accountability by the Presiding Officer of 
the Municipal Board and the City Treasurer on May 25, 1957 and May 28, 1957, 
respectively (Exhs. 8-C and 8-D). He accepted the certificates issued therefor 
in which he was alluded to as former Secretary to the Board. Thus, we find the 
petitioner's behavior literally meaning an acquiescence to his separation from 
office as Secretary to the Municipal Board of Roxas City.</p>
<p>''The filing of this action has not altered the situation in which the 
petitioner placed himself, unless we permit inconsistency as means of promoting 
one's own personal interest. Indeed, the petitioner can hardly turn back after 
he had admitted his separation from the service in his application for terminal 
leave, received the compensation he soughtl thereby and consented to be alluded 
to in other documents as an Ex-Secretary to the City Municipal 
Board.''</p></blockquote>
<p>Against the above decision the present petition for certiorari has been 
presented by the petitioner, he claiming that the commutation of his accrued 
vacation and sick leaves does not constitute acquiescence to the illegal 
ouster.</p>
<p>Our study of the decision appealed from creates the belief that the decision 
does not hold that the receipt and acceptance of the accumulated vacation and 
sick leaves constitute <i>per se</i> an acquiescence to petitioner's ouster. It 
is rather that the successive acts of petitioner disclose or prove that he (the 
petitioner) was renouncing or desisting from his move to continue with his case. 
The circumstances which lead to this conclusion are (1) his statement that 
commutation of his vacation and sick leaves was being asked for as "<i>an 
incident to separation from the service effective from November 19, 1956</i>"; 
(2) the fact that he must have asked for his clearance from money and property 
accountability from the presiding officer of the municipal board; and (3) his 
having secured a clearance from the city treasurer for his money and property 
accountability on May 28, 1957. It is to be noted that at the time he secured 
the clearances from the two offices above mentioned, his petition in this Court 
had been dismissed and he had been notified of such dismissal. At that time 
also, he had not presented any new petition for quo warranto before the court of 
first instance. For a period of more than two months he did not take steps to 
revive the action that had been dismissed in this Court. We note that he did not 
expressly state or indicate that he was getting his accumulated vacation and 
sick leaves because he needed money, or that he received his pay and secured his 
clearances but was reserving to himself the right to continue his quo warranto 
action. The presentation of his complaint in July, 1957 was made only two months 
after he received his money as his termination pay. Under the circumstances we 
rather believe that the filing of the present case was an after-thought, coming 
to him after he had already desired to renounce his right to continue the action 
and received his termination pay. We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals 
that the acts of the petitioner herein indicated a renunciation of the action 
that he had begun.</p>
<p>The finding of the Court of Appeals, that the acts constitute a renunciation 
of his right to continue his action for quo warranto, is a finding of fact that 
the Court of Appeals made, which finding of fact we cannot review. The 
conclusion of the Court of Appeals is a conclusion of fact arising from a series 
of acts of the petitioner; it is a finding of fact to the effect that the 
petitioner renounced the action that he had to enforce his rights. Taking into 
account that this is a conclusion of fact made by the Court of Appeals upon 
consideration of the circumstances surrounding the case, and finding no abuse of 
discretion on the part of the Court in arriving at this conclusion, We are 
constrained to deny the petition. The writ is hereby denied, without costs.</p> <i>Bengzcn, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,
