				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the above-named plaintiff-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>, from an order of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Branch I, in a suit for the declaration of ownership
and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a parcel of land against the
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, and docketed as Civil Case No. 2667,
ordering the said plaintiff-appellant to stop, in the course of a trial, from
presenting evidence of ownership over the contested land on the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint that the plaintiff-appellant filed with the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> on 2 June 1954 alleges ownership and actual, quiet, peaceful,
public, continuous and adverse possession for more than ten years by him and
his predecessors-in-interest of a parcel of land, which is described in
paragraph 2 of the complaint, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A parcel of land located in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sirang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, bounded on the
North, before, <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> Moreno now, Mariano
Rodriguez; on the East by <span class="SpellE">Himaano</span> River; on the South
by <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Polices before, now <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>; and on the West by <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span> before, now <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span>

in the name of <span class="SpellE">Ma<span style="">merto</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>."</span></span><span style=""> </span>(R. A., page 2);</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">that "on or about 25 February
1949" the defendant obtained a home­stead patent, covered by Certificate
of Title No. 104 of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, for an 8-hectare-and-28-are parcel of land, which
parcel of land included the first-described parcel of land; and that the
defendant, after having fraudulently secured the said certificate of title, is
now attempting to assert ownership over the said first-described smaller
parcel, "the same being on the northwestern part of the land covered by
the patent".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff prayed for
judgment, declaring him as the owner of the first-described smaller parcel of
land and ordering the defendant to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant filed, on <st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="6">23
 June 1954</st1:date>, his answer to the complaint, with affirmative defenses
and counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied the
plaintiff's allegations of ownership and possession and alleged, among several
other allegations, that he is the registered owner of the whole parcel of land
which includes the smaller one as an integral part; that the defendant
"was in the exclusive possession of the parcel of land covered by the said
O. C. T. No. 104, including the portion thereof described under paragraph 2 of
the complaint, until 24 February 1949 when the defendant conditionally sold to
the plaintiff a portion of the aforesaid property covered by the said O. C. T.
No. 104 but instead of taking possession of the portion thus conditionally sold
to him, the plaintiff unlawfully took possession also of the parcel of land
described in the complaint"; that his title is incontrovertible; that
"plaintiff is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from asserting
title" to the contested portion of land" as he knew that such portion
forms part of the registered bigger parcel of land" and the defendant
"delivered to the plaintiff the owner's dupli­cate of said O. C. T. No.
104"; that although on 24 February 1949 the defendant sold to the plaintiff,
subject to the defendant's right to repurchase, only a portion of four and
one-fourth (4 1/4) hectares of the land covered by the title, the plaintiff
took possession of more than seven hectares and thus deprived the defendant of
the possession of more than 3 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This 3-hectare portion is described in the answer with counterclaim, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"North -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the remainder of the property of the de­fendant,
<span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>East<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by
the <span class="SpellE">Himaano</span> <span class="GramE">river</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>South -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by the property of the heirs of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">West
-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by the <span class="SpellE">Lagundi</span>
Creek."</span> (R. A., page 9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The defendant prayed for the dismissal of
the complaint and for the plaintiff to vacate the portion of 3 hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> answered, on <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="6">26 June 1954</st1:date>, the counterclaim with
denials and alleged that the portion of 3 hectares that the defendant claims to
have been deprived of is the very land which is the subject-matter of his
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">About a year after the defendant had filed his answer and counterclaim,
he filed, on <st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="6">20 June 1955</st1:date>,
a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack of cause of action and
<span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by the plaintiff from claiming ownership (R.
A., page 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff objected to
the motion, to which the defendant interposed a reply, filed on <st1:date year="1955" day="9" month="7">9 July 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annexed to this reply was <span style="">a </span>"Deed of Conditional
Sale", purportedly executed on 24 February 1949 by the defendant in favor
of the plaintiff, of a parcel of land with an area of four and one-fourth (4
1/4) hectares which is an integral part of the land described in Homestead
Patent No. <span class="GramE">V2117, issued on </span><st1:date year="1949" day="26" month="1"><span class="GramE">26 January 1949</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the
paragraphs of this deed states that the vendor has been in continuous
possession of the land "since 1921 up to the present"; another
paragraph states that the vendee, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>, agrees to all and every stipulation or condition
stated in the deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both vendor and
vendee signed the deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="18" month="7">18 July 1955</st1:date>,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> filed an "Answer to
Reply".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this pleading, he
admitted that the title of the land is in the name of the defendant and that
the land in question is included in the titled land; that although he was in
possession of the certificate of title on <st1:date year="1949" day="24" month="2">24 February 1949</st1:date> he denied "actual knowledge that the
land in question was in­cluded in the title".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(R. A., pages 44-45)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="19" month="7">19 July 1955</st1:date>,
the lower court issued an order denying the motion to dismiss (R. A., pages
45-46).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 February 1957, defendant <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>,
together with a certain Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Nelayan</span>, who does not
appear to be a party <span style="">in </span>the case
(Civil Case No. 2667), again filed a motion to dismiss, asking for the recon­sideration
of the denial of his previous motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of cause
of action and lack of jurisdiction for the court to annul the Certificate of
Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>
again filed an objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
denied the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial at <span style="">last </span>started,
but, in the course of the initial hearing, counsel for the defendant moved to
strike out the tes­timony of the first witness for the plaintiff on the ground
that the plaintiff is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from proving ownership
of the contested land (R. A., page 60).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="7">5 July 1963</st1:date>,
the court issued the order that the plaintiff has elevated, by way of appeal,
to this Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the appealed
order, the plaintiff was held in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> from
proving ownership because he had recognized that the land in question forms an
integral part of titled land and also, in the conditional sale, that the land
in question, which was north of the portion that he bought, is the property of
the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order did not order
the dismissal of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the plaintiff-appellant should be deemed to have
ad­mitted the genuineness and due execution of the deed of conditional
sale:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
alleged the deed and its recitals and annexed a copy thereto in his "reply
to objection", but the plaintiff-appellant did not deny it under oath
(Answer to Reply, R. A., pages 40- 45).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The genuineness and due execution of a written instrument copied in or
attached to a pleading should be denied specifically under oath, otherwise they
are deemed admitted (Section 8, Rule 8, Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Songco</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sellner</span>, 37 Phil. 254).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed is not merely evidentiary, as it is
not a collateral matter, for it is the basis of the affirmative defense of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> of the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
as set forth in his answer (R. A., page 8).</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that the import of the
alleged admissions of appellant <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> made in the
1949 deed of sale <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>, Exhibit "A" (R. A., page
37), are not sufficiently precise and specific to predicate an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> deed the appellant agreed to the
following:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </span>have
sold, conveyed and transferred and by these presents, do sell, convey and transfer
unto said <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>,
his heirs, successors and assigns, subject to the terms and conditions
stipulated below, a parcel of <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> described as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">' A parcel of irrigated rice land covering four (4) and one-fourth
hectares situated in barrio Curry, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
Philippines, bounded on the North, by the property of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span>; on the East, by the <span class="SpellE">Himaano</span>
River and the South, by the property of the Hrs. <span style="">of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, and West, by the <span class="SpellE">Lagundi</span> Creek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>This parcel of land is an integral part of the land described under
Homestead Patent No. V2117 issued on <st1:date year="1949" day="26" month="1">January
 26, 1949</st1:date>, and declared for taxation under Tax Dec. No. 2820,
assessed at P3<span class="GramE">,105.00</span> in the name of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That since 1921 up to the present, I have been in the
continuous and peaceful possession of the above -described parcel of land,
first in my own initiative and in concept of an owner, and later on by virtue
of a home­stead application."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noticed that there are three pertinent statements of
fact made in the deed:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the parcel of land sold (4-1/4 hectares)
was bounded on the <u>north</u> by the property of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span> (the vendor), <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
herein;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That said parcel is an integral part of the
land described in the Homestead Patent No. V-2117 issued on <st1:date year="1949" day="26" month="1">26 January 1949</st1:date>, declared and
assessed for taxation in the name of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That since 1921 up to the present (1949, when
the deed was executed) <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> had been in continuous
possession of the above-described parcel of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">None of these propositions are incompatible with the present
claims of appellant herein, to the effect that he and his <span class="SpellE"><u>causantes</u></span>
owned the <u>northwestern</u> (not northern) portion of the land covered by the
homestead patent of <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, and that the latter
fraudulently included that part in his homestead application, for which reason
he filed the action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter suit is precisely predicated upon
the fact that this disputed portion was included in <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>'
homestead patent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed that in the deed aforementioned <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>
admitted that <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> had been in possession as owner
of the "above described parcel of land" since 1921.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is not definite whether the parcel of
land "above described" refers to the 4-1/4 hectares covered by the
deed of sale (and which lay southeast of the parcel claimed by <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>) or to the entirety of the land included in the
homestead patent of <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, the probabilities are that
"above-described parcel of land" refers only to the 4-1/4-hectare
portion sold <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> to herein appellant, for it is the
boundaries of that land which are specified in the deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The limits of the entire area covered by the
patent are not specified.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that -</p>

<blockquote>"To constitute an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by deed,
a distinct and precise assertion of a fact is necessary . . . . . . Such <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> should be certain to every intent" (Van
Rensselaer vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Kearney</st1:place></st1:city>, 13 Law Ed.
703; 19 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 603),</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and that, as ruled in Gilmer vs.
Poindexter, 13 L. Ed. 411, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by deed can not
prevent the denial of an equitable title which is not identical with the legal
title, <span style="">we </span>conclude that no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> can be predicated on the 1949 deed of sale <u>a</u>
<u>retro</u> executed by both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also claimed that appellant is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
by his admission in paragraph 2 of his reply to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
Counterclaim in the court below (R. A., pages 9 and 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim is likewise untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph I of the counterclaim is as follows
(R. A., page 9):</p>

<blockquote>"That although on February 24, 1949, the defendant sold to the
plaintiff, subject to the de­fendant's right to repurchase, only a portion of
four and one fourth (4-1/4) hectares of a bigger parcel of land belonging to
the defendant and covered by O. <span style="">C. </span>T.
No. 104, the said plaintiff unlawfully took possession of more than seven
hectares thereby wrongfully depriving the defend­ant of the possession of more
than three (3) hectares of land and the products thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant replied to the preceding charge in the following terms
(R. A., page 14):</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff denies generally and specifically
all of the allegations of the counterclaim and has no knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8 and 9 of the said counterclaim;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the portion of land of three (3) hectares
which is mentioned in paragraph 1 of the counterclaim is the very land which is
the subject-matter of the complaint and the truth of the matter is what appears
in said complaint;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, defendant-appellant merely pleaded that the three
hectares lay <u>outside</u> of the parcel purchased by hire <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>
from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere did he admit that these 3 hectares were a part of the parcel he
had previously purchased, and, therefore, never recognized that the same was
owned or possessed by <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conduct of appellant is perfectly
consistent with the theory of his complaint that <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>
improperly included these three hectares in his homestead applica­tion, for
which reason appellant demands its <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that a grantee is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to
deny the title of his grantor is correct only if limited to the property
actually conveyed and to the time of the conveyance in this case, as the
property subject of the complaint was not the parcel bought by <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> under the deed, Exhibit "A", <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> does not apply.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order under review, declaring <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from proving his title to the land claimed in his
complaint, is reversed and set aside; and the case is remanded to the court below
for further proceedings, hearing and resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</span></p>
