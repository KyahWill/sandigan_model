appellant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Enchong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, was convicted in a decision dated December

of <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> in the sum of P12,000.00, and to pay said heirs the

<p class="BODY">This case is before Us for review by reason of the death penalty
imposed on the appellant, in the same way and for the same purpose, as an
earlier decision also imposing the death penalty on his co-accused, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span>, has been elevated to this Court after an
earlier trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two other accused,
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Duria</span> and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Agujo</span>

with page reference to the transcript of the stenographic notes, and the
records of the case, bear the mark of accuracy, and may well be quoted for a
narration of the events that constituted the actual commission of the crime and
those that preceded and followed the same, specially as appellant's defense of
alibi does not dispute the facts except only as to deny the acts imputed to
him.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"At about the hours of 8:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock in the
evening of March 12, 1969, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> was in his
house in barrio <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, (p. 2, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 3,
1970, <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>) with his wife, <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>, his
mother, <span class="SpellE">Flaviana</span> Cato, their maid, <span class="SpellE">Tarcila</span> <span class="SpellE">Vaculanta</span>, and their four
children, namely, Hercules, Henry, <span class="SpellE">Laarni</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leny</span> (p. 3, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was already lying down as he had finished eating ahead of his wife
who was still partaking of her meal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before eating that supper, he turned over to her the sum of P80.00 which
was the earnings of their one jeep and five <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>
(pp. 4, 8-9, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She put the money
in her pocket (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 3, 1970,
Victoria).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While still lying down, he
heard a thud ("<span class="SpellE">balabag</span>") and footsteps
("<span class="SpellE">yabag</span>") and somebody shouting to bring
out their money. He was about to stand up when he saw accused Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span> and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Duria</span>, who
were both armed with carbines, pushing his wife towards the room where he was
lying down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his wife reached the
door, he heard a shot and saw her fall down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span> fired his carbine at him
successively (pp. 4-6, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 3, <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
intentionally made himself fall down from the bed at the end portion of which
his three children were sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
youngest child, who was less than a year old, was in her cradle and about four
meters away from him and about two meters from Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span>
and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Duria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span> continued firing at him and
when he was already out of ammunition, he ran away (pp. 6-9, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From under the bed where he hid in a crawling
position, he saw Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Agujo</span>, another accused, in
the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the house holding his daughter <span class="SpellE">Leny</span> with his left hand and a .45 cal. pistol with the
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Agujo</span>
saw him and fired at him but hit the crib instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span>
and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Duria</span> were still in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Duria</span> and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Agujo</span> escaped
ahead of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span> (pp. 9-12, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span>
left, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> followed him up to the balcony
where Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, another accused, fired at him
but missed from the foot of the stairs with a <span class="SpellE">Garand</span>
rifle (pp. 13-14, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> then went back to the room where his wife was
already unconsciou<span style="">s, </span>with wounds
in the left palm and in the left chest above the nipple (pp. 14-16,
ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He brought her to the San Miguel
Emergency Hospital (p. 20, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that hospital, he found out that her pocket was opened, without the money and
contained only <span class="SpellE">colgate</span> (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Aug. 3, 1970, Victoria).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lucila</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span>, a physician in
hospital, treated Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 o'clock</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1969</st1:date> (pp. 4, 8, 20-21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="8">Aug. 3, 1970</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>; <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "A,"
"A-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> wa<span style="">s </span>in
serious condition and needing a major operation which could not be performed at
the emergency hospital for lack of adequate facilities, the patient was
transferred to the Philippine General Hospital (pp. 5,7,20, ibid.) where she
was operated on by Dr. Acosta, but she died on the operating table on May __,
1969 (p. 22, ibid.; p. 4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 24,
1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of her death, she was
a public school teacher and more than five months pregnant (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 3, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the same night of <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1969</st1:date>, the Police Department of San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
received reports of the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A team of policemen was sent to the house of
the <span class="SpellE">Manuzons</span> consisting of Sgt. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Violago</span>, team leader, and Patrolmen Leonardo J. Rodriquez, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Rivera, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and Federico <span class="SpellE">Abosa</span>,
members, to make on-the-spot investigation (pp. 2-4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Aug. 10, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The team interrogated
neighbors of the deceased and obtained or found physical evidence among which
were the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five (5) empty
shells of cal. 30 carbine near the bedroom of <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>; five (5)
empty shells of cal. .45 along the road in front of the house of the <span class="SpellE">Manuzons</span> going to <span class="SpellE">Candaba</span>; one
(1) empty shell of Cal. 30 M-1 beneath the front staircase; three (3) slugs
inside the dresser; one (1) bullet hole on the front door, one (1) in the beam
of the ceiling, and two (2) in the window; blood stains near the door of the
bedroom (pp. 4-7, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The team was
also able to trace that the escape route of the culprits to be at the rear of
the house leading to the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> (p. 8, ibid.).</blockquote>

Dr. Vidal found contusions, abrasions and gunshot wounds on the body of the

medico-legal officer found two (2) gunshot wounds. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Gunshot wound No. 1 is located at the anterior
chest wall the direction of which is backward, laterally and downward,
perforating particularly the upper lobe of the left lung, then making its exit
at infra scapular region, at the left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gunshot wound No. 2 is located at the left-hand, dorsal aspect and the
exit is located in the opposite side (pp. 1-4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
</span><st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="8"><span style="">Aug. 24, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death is Gunshot wound No. 1 (p.

<blockquote>"After the perpetration of the heinous crime, the four accused
went in hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the part of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, Philippine Constabulary soldiers tried many times
to apprehend him, on the strength of a warrant of arrest, at his house at
barrio <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
but without success, for persons in the vicinity from whom inquiries were made,
including his father, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, a policeman of
San Miguel when the crime at bar was committed (pp. 35-36, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Aug. 10, 1970) told the arresting officers that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
was not at home (pp. 1-4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 10,
1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1970</st1:date>, however, upon a tip from Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> that Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was
hiding in the house of his aunt who was the sister of his father, PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> Ramirez, Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and Cpl. Rodolfo Garcia accompanied by Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>,
proceeded to said house situated in barrio <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span>
and surrounded it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group asked a
woman near the house if Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was inside
and her answer was in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
when they heard footsteps of someone running in the house, they rushed towards
the window facing the river to prevent him from escaping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On seeing Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
about to jump from the window, Cpl. Garcia and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>
fired warning shots, Cpl. Garcia at the same time shouting:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Don't try to escape anymore and
surrender peacefully and nothing will happen to you." Apparently, this
dissuaded the wanted man from trying a getaway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sgt. Ramirez was about to go upstairs when Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra's</span>
father came running along from his house which was 200 meters away, telling
Sgt. Ramirez not to go up the house anymore as he would surrender his son,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, who was escorted to the Municipal
building (pp. 7-10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 20, 1970; pp. 2-5, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 10, 1970)."</blockquote>

time, and that </span>the <span style="">shocking

<p class="BODY">It is a proven fact that appellant left his barrio <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span>, San Miguel, after the commission of the crime and
the filing of the complaint against him and his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to <span class="SpellE">Talavera</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and did not
return to <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span> until the second week of June, 1970
a period of more than one year and two months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he returned, he did so surreptitiously, and went to live in the
house of an aunt where he was arrested on <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1970</st1:date>, not in the house of his father, only 200
meters distant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His presence in the
house was even tried to be concealed from the peace officers who went there to
arrest him by a woman seen near the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant himself tried to jump out of the window to avoid arrest, his
attempted escape having been foiled only by the alertness of the arresting officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's father arrived from his house,
and he asked the arresting officers not to go up the house anymore, as he would
surrender his son to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts of
appellant as just described were obviously those of one actually fleeing from
the scene of the crime, a flight clearly indicative of a guilty mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was, indeed, no intimation of any motive on the part of
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> to falsely implicate appellant in the
commission of the heinous crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
appellant is the son of a policeman of the town should have deterred witness <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> from pointing said appellant as among the dastardly
authors of the crime, unless he actually participated in its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts above narrated as to the flight of
appellant, his surreptitious return to his barrio only after more than a year's
absence <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, living not in his father's house
as he used to but in that of an aunt, and his attempted escape when his arrest
was imminent, lend credence to the testimony of the state witness whose
veracity appellant tries hard, but vainly, to attack and impugn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed, with such gravely damaging
testimony, particularly as to appellant's having been identified as one of the
culprits, his defense of alibi would completely fall to pieces, unavailing
against such solid evidence of his having actually participated in the
commission of the crime, beyond that of a mere co-conspirator, absent from the
scene of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

allegedly only within hearing distance of the shooting that took place at the
scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person he was
allegedly with, his cousin Fred <span class="SpellE">Lacsamana</span>, in the
latter's house, was not presented to corroborate him as to his whereabouts at
the precise time that the crime was being committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weakness of appellant's alibi is, thus,
so apparent that it cannot outweigh the evidence <span style="">against him in the form of his having been positively identified by
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> who was not shown to have any motive
to falsely charge appellant with so grave a crime as a capital offense,
appellant being even a son of one of the </span><span style="">town </span><span style="">policemen at the
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not true that the

conviction against herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
it did, appellant's complaint of denial of due process would weigh heavily
against the validity of the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the trial court merely quoted in its
decision now under review portions of the decision against Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span> based on the principal evidence presented,
namely, the testimony of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>, which was
essentially as he gave it in the earlier trial held separately against Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span>, co-accused of appellant under the same
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge must have
thought it more convenient to quote from his earlier decision in </span>p<span style="">resenting both the assessment of the identical
evidence presented in both hearings, and the rulings cited in support of his
appreciation of said evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's
accusation against the trial judge in the procedure or form adopted by the
latter in writing his decision is broad and general, without any specification
as to what in the quoted portion incorporated in the decision herein appealed
from, is devoid of basis in the evidence presented in the trial of the instant
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the accusation, therefore,
totally unfounded, and also unfair to His Honor, the trial judge, who must be
presumed to know so elementary a rule of procedure as that of considering only
evidence duly presented during the trial for or against any party to the
action, and made the sole basis of the decision therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In convicting the

reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the actual act

appellant's co-accused, appellant is equally guilty for the crime committed,
notwithstanding that he did not even go up the house robbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a previous conspiracy existed among the
four accused, including appellant, is evident from his presence at the scene of
the crime with an evidently assigned role in the perpetration thereof -- that
of being the lookout downstairs, while his companions went up the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">alloted</span> duty
was made manifest when he fired at Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>
when the latter reached the balcony of his house when attempting to pursue
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Catindihan</span> who rushed out of the house on
using up all his ammunitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
existence of conspiracy is, therefore, clearly proved by the concert of
criminal design among the culprits, so patent from the common object which
their individual acts were aimed to attain.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Accordingly, the liability of each is that
of co-principals, the act of one, </span>being in contemplation of law, the act
of all.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In imposing the death penalty, the trial court considered the
aggravating circumstance of nighttime, band, superior strength and dwelling,
without any mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find the presence of the aforesaid aggravating circumstances fully supported by
the evidence, and appellant has himself not disputed this finding of the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, it is the duty of this Court, unpleasant though
it may be, to affirm the judgment appealed from in all respects, with
proportionate costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
