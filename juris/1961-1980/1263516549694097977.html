				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary mandatory injunction to annul
an order of respondent Hon. Jose M. Mendoza, as Judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, dismissing the appeal sought to be
taken by petitioners herein from a decision and an order of said respondent in
Civil Case No. R-7793 of said Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that as administrator of the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, deceased, the
settlement of which is the subject matter of Special Proceedings No. 2205-R of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, its Clerk of
Court, Vicente Miranda - hereinafter referred to as the Administrator -
commenced Civil Case No. R-7793 of the same Court against most of the
petitioners herein, namely, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Chun, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suat</span> Hong, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span>
Bee, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Seko</span>, Tan Ho, <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> <span class="SpellE">Dycothay</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> Commercial Company, New <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
Commercial, East Mindanao Lumber Company, <span class="SpellE">Hiap</span> Bee
and East Mindanao Lum­ber Company, <span class="SpellE">Hiap</span> Bee and East
Mindanao Lumber Company, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his amended complaint, Miranda alleged that prior to and at
the time of his death in China sometime in 1941, <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, who resided in the Philippines since the
beginning of the century, had, in <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City,
well-developed and established business and commercial enterprises with
substantial bank deposits and about 127 parcels of land or property; that <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span> went to China,
in 1934, and, thereafter, became seriously ill; that, at that time, his
children, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Chun and <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suat</span> Hong<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Siok</span> Lee<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and his <span class="SpellE">protegees</span> <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> Bee
and <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Seko</span> were working as
his Manager and/or employees in the aforementioned business establishments;
that taking advantage of the absence and bad condition of the health of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, particularly
of his subsequent death, the defendants therein (petitioners herein) took over
said business, in­cluding its assets, goods, merchandise, chattels, machinery,
stock-­in-trade, cash on hand and in banks, amounts receivable and other
properties of the deceased, as well as his store known as "<span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span> Store", and its branches, and organized
first, a fake partnership with the business name of "<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>
Commercial Company", and then the East Mindanao Lumber Co., which operated
and did business with the capital, assets, stocks-in-trade, merchandise, funds
and other pro­perty of said deceased; that with funds belonging to the latter,
the de­fendants therein (petitioners herein) moreover purchased several parcels
of land, on one of which a 20-door apartment building was constructed, with
funds of the same nature, and let to Chinese tenants and other lessees; that
the defendants therein (petitioners herein) had received and are receiving the
rentals, earnings and profits derived from said business and property of the
deceased; and that said de­fendants (petitioners herein) hold, manage and
operate the aforemen­tioned business, properties and income <u>in</u> <u>trust</u>
for the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, but have not rendered any accounting thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Administrator prayed, therefore, that judgment be rendered
declaring that said business, assets, income and other property, are in the
possession and under the management and control of said defendants (petitioners
herein) as mere trustees thereof, and sentencing them to turn over and deliver
the same to him, as Administrator of the Intestate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, as well as to
render ac­counts and to execute the corresponding deeds of conveyance, in addi­tion
to paying damages and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
appropriate proceedings, said Court, presided over by respondent Judge,
rendered a decision finding that most of the allegations of the Administrator
had been duly proven and, accordingly, sentenced the defendants therein
(petition­ers herein):</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(To) Deliver all properties found by the Court
(in the body of its decision) to belong to the estate of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, to plaintiff as administrator of the Estate
of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To render full, accurate and correct
accounting of all the fruits and proceeds of the properties which each of the
defendants had possessed and which has been found by this Court as properties
belonging to the estate of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, from 1935 until the present date;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To render full, accurate and correct account­ing
of all the fruits, interest, profits and assets as well as properties acquired
by the <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> Commercial Com­pany, New <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> Commercial Company, East Minda­nao Lumber Company,
East Mindanao Lumber Company, Inc., from 1935 up to the present date;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay by way of exemplary damages, jointly
and severally, the sum of P60,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Sio</span> Pong and <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Suat</span> Ngo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay to counsel for plaintiff, jointly and
se­verally, the sum of P30,000.00 as attorney's fees, including the cost of
this suit.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">SO ORDERED."</p>

<p class="BODY">Copy of this decision was, on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1965</st1:date>, served upon the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 9, they filed their notice of
appeal and appeal bond and the next day, they submitted their record on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1965</st1:date>, they filed, however, a motion for
reconsideration and new trial, which was denied on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of the order to this effect was served
upon them on October 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 26,
they filed a notice to the effect that, on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1965</st1:date>, they would submit for consideration the
record on appeal filed on August 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
November 13, defendants filed additional pages to be attached to said record on
appeal, whereas the administrator objected to the approval thereof, upon the
ground that the decision was already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 29, respondent Judge issued an
order declaring that "the defendants (petitioners herein) have not
perfected their appeal on time" and that the aforementioned decision had,
consequently, become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of this order was denied on December 15, 1965,
whereupon said defendants - petitioners herein – instituted the present
original, action for <i style="">certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i style="">mandamus</i>, with a writ
of preliminary mandatory injunction, against the administrator and respondent
Judge, alleging that the latter had acted with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction in issuing said orders of November 29 and
December 15, 1965, and praying, accordingly, that said orders be declared null
and void, and that respondent Judge be directed to give due course to the afore
mentioned appeal of petitioners herein as defendants in said case No.
R-7793.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after the commencement of
these proceedings, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="12">December 24,
 1965</st1:date>, we issued a writ restraining respondents there­in, until <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1966</st1:date>, from implementing,
enforcing and executing the orders of respondent Judge dated November 29 and <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1966</st1:date>, said writ was incorporated into a writ of preliminary
injunction, upon the posting and approval of a bond, filed by the petitioners,
in the sum of P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition herein and the answer thereto filed by respondents
discuss rather extensively the question whether or not petitioners had
perfected their appeal in the lower court within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find it, however, unnecessary
to pass upon said question, for the reason presently to be stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although declaring that most of the properties involved in the
litigation belong to the estate of <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dydongco</span>, the decision of respondent Judge, dated July 30,
1965, moreover, required petitioners herein to render a "full, accurate
and complete accounting of all the fruits and proceeds" of said
properties. After analyzing previous rulings thereon, this Court declared, in <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Carrascoso</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that a decision of such nature is interlocutory in character, because it does
not dispose of the action in its entirety and leaves something to be done to
complete the relief sought, and that, accordingly, it is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, until after the adjudications necessary for the
completion of said relief shall have been made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the very counsel for petitioners herein now accept this view and
concede that petitioners' appeal had been taken prematurely.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
this case should be as it is hereby dismissed and the writ prayed for denied,
with costs against petitioners herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1966</st1:date>, is, accordingly,
dissolved.</p>
