				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These three cases are inter-related.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">G.R. No.</span> L-26396 is
an appeal by Dr. Antonio Rodriguez from the judgment of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dismissing the petition for
certiorari he had filed against <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, Com­missioner of Civil Service, in connection with
the lat­ter's decision in two administrative cases against said
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G.R. Nos. L-27026 and
L-27027 are original petitions for certiorari and prohibition filed in this
Court by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, questioning the
actuation of the Civil Service Board of Appeals in taking cognizance of the
appeal from the same decision rendered by him against Dr. Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Rodriguez was Medical Adviser (Chief of Section) in the
Bureau of Medical Services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 1,
1959, he was detailed as head of the National Mental Hospital by the then
Secretary of Health, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> Valencia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 8, 1960 he was administratively
charged on nine counts (Adm. Case No. R-23237), to investigate which the
Secretary formed a committee composed of several members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending investigation, or on May 29, 1961,
Dr. Rodriguez was appointed "Chief of Hospital IV (R-54) in the Hospi­tal
Services (National Mental Hospital), Field Operations,” which appointment was
approved by the Acting Chief, Per­sonnel Transaction Division, in behalf of
then Commis­sioner of Civil Service <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> del
Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the in­vestigation, where
evidence was adduced by both parties, the committee rendered its report on
November 20, 1961, finding the respondent innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon its recommendation the Secretary of
Health exonerated him completely and indorsed the findings to Commissioner del
Rosario, who, how­ever, in his decision dated May 417, 1962, found Dr. Rod­riguez
"guilty of indiscretion" in connection with spe­cification
"b" of the charges, for having caused slaugh­tered pigs (belonging to
the National Mental Hospital) to be given to his superior and to the Auditor
General." The penalty administered to him was an "admonition to be
more careful in his activities."</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 29, 1962 Dr. Rodriguez moved for reconsider­ation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his motion he did not question the factual
find­ings in the decision; he simply pointed out that the of­fense of
"indiscretion" did not exist in the statutes or in the civil service
rules and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His prayer was
that the verdict on that particular count "be entirely deleted from the
records of the case." Eight months there­after, or on February 22, 1963,
Rodriguez wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Civil Service withdrawing his
mo­tion for reconsideration and manifesting his conformity to the decision of
May 17, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason he gave for the
withdrawal was that the administrative case had been pend­ing for a long time
and affected not only his peace of mind but also the "interest of (the)
public institution committed to his responsibility." On March 18, 1963 the
request for withdrawal was granted by the Department Le­gal Counsel of the
Civil Service Commission, who signed the corresponding <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
"For the Commissioner." On May 6, 1963 <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, then Acting Commissioner of Civil Service,
revoked the grant of withdrawal as having been issued without authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, under date of January 23, 1962, another administrative
complaint, No. 24354, had been lodged with the Secretary of Health against Dr.
Rodriguez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the seven charges was
electioneering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the Secre­tary
created an investigating committee, to which he issued the following directive:</p>

<blockquote>"To study the nature of such charges and determine the merit
of each case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case this committee
finds sufficient grounds for investigation, it is hereby directed that a formal
investigation be con­ducted in accordance with existing rules and
regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the investigation of
the case, the Com­mittee shall submit to the under­signed its findings,
comments and recommendations."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The investigating committee required Dr. Rodriguez to submit his
explanation, which he did on March 6, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On August 29, 1962 the committee, on the basis of the said explanation
alone and without conducting a formal investigation, rendered a memorandum
report recommend­ing exoneration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
October 29, 1962 the Secretary of Health indorsed the recommendation, with his
full con­currence, to the Civil Service Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 12, 1963 Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subido</span> rendered a joint decision in the two
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Case No. 23237 he found Dr.
Rodriguez guilty of misconduct in of­fice for having loaned government
construction materials to a private contractor in connection with a project the
latter was doing for the National Mental Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a charge not touched upon in the
motion for reconsi­deration of Dr. Rodriguez, and of which he had already been
found innocent by the investigating Committee cre­ated by the Secretary of
Health, by the Secretary himself and by Civil Service Commissioner <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Case
No. 24354 the Commissioner found the respondent guilty of the charge of
electioneering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty imposed was
dismissal from office, which the Commissioner ordered, in the same decision,
immediately executed "in the public interest."</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Rodriguez personally received a copy of the de­cision on
September 14, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day he
filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, alleging that the decision
had been rendered without due process of law, and without jurisdiction or with
grave abuse of discret­ion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
injunction was issued by the Court, restrain­ing immediate execution of the
verdict of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 23, 1966 Dr. Rodriguez appealed the decision of
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> to the Civil Service Board of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 4, 1966 the Court of
First Instance dismissed the petition for certiorari on the ground of
non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. Rodriguez moved to reconsider, and after his motion was denied,
filed a petition for review with preliminary injunction in the Court of
Appeals, which thereafter certified the case to this Court, where it was
docketed as Case No. 26396.</p>

<p class="BODY">Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, on his part, tried
to have the Civil Service Board of Appeals dismiss the respondent's appeal
before it on the ground that the same had been filed out of time and that his
decision was already final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board
turned down the plea, and Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> came to
this Court on certiorari and prohibition, his pe­tition being docketed under
Nos. <span class="GramE">L-27026 and 27027.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 5, 1967, this Court issued an order tem­porarily
restraining the Civil Service Board of Appeals from taking cognizance of and
assuming jurisdiction over the appeal taken by Dr. Rodriguez, but the order
failed to take effect because two days before, or on January 3, the Board had
decided the appeal, declaring the decision of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>
null and void for having been rend­ered "without jurisdiction and without
due process of law," and ordering the reinstatement of Dr. Rodriguez to
his position.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are two issues presented for resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) whether or not the decision of
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> was rendered with jurisdiction
and/or due process; and (b) whether or not the appeal taken by Dr. Rodriguez to
the Civil Service Board of Appeals was timely.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to
Administrative Case No. 23237 our position is that the decision of Commissioner
<span class="SpellE">Amado</span> del Rosario dated May 17, 1962, finding Dr.
Rodriguez guilty of indiscretion and imposing upon him the penalty of
admonition, had already become final and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> to set it aside when he did sp
and rendered his own decision on September 12, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, Dr. Rodriguez moved for re­consideration
of the <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he with­drew that motion on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1963</st1:date>; and since no act­ion
thereon had yet been taken at the time, the with­drawal was a matter of right
on his part, subject neither to approval nor to disapproval by the
Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been said, however, that the complainant in the said
administrative case sent a letter to the Com­missioner on <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1962</st1:date>, asking for a "revalua­tion
of the entire evidence in this case ….." We do not believe, however, that
the step thus taken by the complainant kept the case open independently of the
mo­tion of Dr. Rodriguez and its subsequent withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears emphasis that this motion of Dr.
Rodriguez did not question the findings of fact in the <span class="GramE">del</span>
Rosario deci­sion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only point it
raised was a legal one - that in connection with the specific charge of which
he had been found guilty, there was no such offense in the ci­vil service law
or regulations as "indiscretion"; and on this ground he asked that
the decision be modified accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter of the complainant was evidently not in­tended to be a
motion for reconsideration, since the complainant was later on to request the
Commissioner that it be considered as such a motion - this on <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1963</st1:date>, after Dr. Rodriguez had
withdrawn his own mo­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the letter
was but an answer or opposition to the said motion-of Dr. Rodriguez, then it
became <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
after the latter was withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, if it was an independent motion for reconsidera­tion in itself then
it was filed out of time - more than seven (7) months after the <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario decision was rend­ered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case that decision had already
become final when Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> reconsidered it
and rend­ered his own decision on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="9">September
 12, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Going now to
Administrative Case No. 24354, our view is that the decision of the
Commissioner suffers from a basic infirmity - that it violated the principle of
due process, having been rendered without investiga­tion and without first
affording the respondent an oppor­tunity to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that the authority
given by the Secretary of Health to the in­vestigating committee he had created
was "to study the nature of (the) charges and determine the merit of each
case (and) in case this committee finds sufficient grounds for investigation,
it is hereby directed that a formal investigation be conducted in accordance
with existing rules and regulations."</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> decision is
sought to be justified by the argument that under Section 32 of the Civil
Service Act of 1959 Dr. Rodriguez had the right to elect a formal
investigation, and since he made no such election he cannot later on be heard
that an investiga­tion was denied him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is here <span class="GramE">a confusion</span> as to the order of
priority among the rungs of the procedural lad­der.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rodriguez could hardly have asked for a
formal investigation at the stage in which the administrative case was at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had merely been required to
submit his explanation in writing, which he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The committee was still to determine whether
there were suf­ficient grounds for investigation, and if there were, to conduct
a formal investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is explicit
in the instruction given by the Secretary of Health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The com­mittee found, on the basis of the
charges and the <span class="GramE">expla­nation, that</span> no formal
investigation was necessary, and hence it recommended that the charges be
dropped for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
recommendation was thereupon favor­ably indorsed by the Secretary of Health to
the Commis­sioner of Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was manifestly neither need nor occasion for Dr. Rodriguez to
elect a formal investigation pursuant to the Civil Service Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been not only premature but
inconsistent for him to ask that he be formally investigated on charges of
which he had already been exonerated.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, despite the findings of the investigating committee and the
concurring recommendation of the Secretary of Health, the Civil Service
Commissioner still consider­ed the charges grave enough to warrant further
action, the basic principle of due process required that Dr. Rodriguez be first
heard in his own defense, or at least al­lowed to express a choice to undergo a
formal investigation or not in accordance with Section 32 of the Civil Service
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right was not accorded
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironi­cally enough Dr. Rodriguez
was found guilty of elect­ioneering on the strength of a letter he had annexed
to his explanation submitted to the investigating com­mittee - a letter which,
if anything, was exculpatory in the light of the charge against him and the
explana­tion that he had submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was accused of electioneering for the benefit of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party; the letter was sent to him by some Liberal Party men in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> thanking him for having employed fourteen (14)
skilled workers who turned out to be "Liberals."</p>

<p class="BODY">A revealing sidelight on this aspect of the case, which shows how
precipitate and groundless was the pro­nouncement, of the guilt of Dr.
Rodriguez, is the follow­ing excerpt from the decision of the Civil Service
Board of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, the Commissioner, without giving the re­spondent
a chance to be heard, found him guilty of partisan poli­tical activity on the
basis of a letter from Liberal Party officials thanking him for having employed
skilled laborers, 14 of whom were election inspectors of the party in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a hearing had been conducted by the Commis­sioner
before he convicted the re­spondent of electioneering, the latter could have
had the opportu­nity to explain how he came to employ the 14 skilled laborers
referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon questioning by the
Board at the hearing of this appeal, the respondent informed the Board that he
did not know the 14 men be­fore he employed them; that they were screened by a
screening com­mittee in the hospital, before they were employed, together with
hund­reds of other <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>; that these 14 were
only part of the 300 casual laborers employed in the hospital because it was
greatly un­dermanned; that the screening com­mittee recommended the employment
of the 14 because they were found to be skilled and with tools; that these
applicants for employ­ment who were not skilled or did not have tools were not
employed in the hospital regardless of re­commendation; that the 14 workers
were not employed at the same time, but they represent the to­tal workers from <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> who had been employed at various times; and that he
came to know that the 14 were election inspectors of the Liberal Party in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> after he had already the letter of thanks regarding
their employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, however,
was barred from making this explanation by his immediate conviction and
dismissal without a hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, respondent was denied due process."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> could validly render his joint
decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1963</st1:date>,
the next question is was the appeal taken by Dr. Rodriguez to the Civil Service
Board of Appeals timely?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As al­ready
observed hereinabove, over the Commissioner's ob­jection the Board took
cognizance of the appeal, held itself with jurisdiction to entertain the same,
and on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1967</st1:date>
promulgated its resolution declaring the decision appealed from null and void
and ordering the reinstatement of Dr. Rodriguez to his position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recourse taken by Dr. Rodriguez to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on certiorari with preliminary
injunction was eventually dismissed by that Court on the ground that the
petitioner had not exhausted the administrative remedy available to him,
namely, by ap­peal to, the Civil Service Board of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, to out mind, open to serious doubt
whether such an appeal was an adequate remedy for the purposes sought by the
petitioner in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, first
of all, chal­lenging the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to render the
decision with respect to the first administrative case, and pleading lack of
due process and grave abuse of discretion with respect to the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the imme­diate relief prayed for was
preliminary injunction to restrain the execution of the decision already
ordered by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These remedies,
while clearly spelled out in the Rules of Court as within the dispensation of
the courts, are nebulous and unsettled when sought in administrative
bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal to the Civil Service
Board of Appeals connotes a review of the case on its merits, a reappraisal of
the evi­dence and of the penalty meted below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the need of the moment, however, is to stop immediate execu­tion of
that penalty and, after hearing, to set aside the decision altogether on
grounds of jurisdiction and due process, we are not prepared to say the doors
of the courts must remain shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
preferable to over­look slight deviations from procedural paths which even to
the discerning may appear quite hazy than dis­regard the greater imperatives of
justice and fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="GramE">all the</span> course pursued in the court below was one in equity,
and the function of equity is to avert or prevent civil injury which may
otherwise be irreparable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all these circumstances, we are of the view that the
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction by the Court of First Instance
interrupted the running of the period within which an appeal could be taken
from the Civil Service Commissioner to the Civil Service Board of Appeals; and
that therefore the appeal, actually taken on the day Dr. Rodriguez receiv­ed
copy of the court's decision, wherein the injunction was dissolved, was a
timely one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Geu­keko</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, etc., 102
Phil. 706, decided Decem­ber 24, 1957, the party adversely affected by a deci­sion
of the Director of Lands relative to a disputed lot in the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong</span>
estate went directly to the Court of First Instance and sought to annul the
said decision instead of appealing to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, which he was supposed to do with­in 60 days under the rules
promulgated by that offi­cial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
injunction was issued by the court, which dismissed the case after more than
two years on the ground that the plaintiff had not exhausted his avail­able
administrative remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal was
then taken from the decision of the Director of the Bureau of Lands to the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court held, when the matter came up be­fore it on mandamus and
prohibition, that the institu­tion of the court action suspended the running of
the period for such appeal, making reference to the admi­nistrative policy of
the Department to that effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the administrative cases against Dr.
Rodriguez, the Civil Service Board of Appeals similarly took cognizance of his appeal
and held that it was timely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed in
its decision it cites a number of cases where appeals (forwarded to it by the
Commissioner) were entertained even after the expiration of the time limit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did no more than what the Secre­tary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources did in the <span class="SpellE">Geukeko</span>
case, and with even greater justification, for there was a judicial injunction
issued against the execu­tion of the decision of the Civil Service
Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the vote on these cases was taken, four mem­bers of this
Court, including the undersigned, concurred in this opinion; two members
dissented; four abstained from voting; and the last one, Justice Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, had not yet been appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the votes on either side are short of
the required majority, the petition of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subido</span> in G. R. Nos. L-27026 and L-27027 should be,
as it is hereby, dismissed, and the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Board of
Appeals in the appeal taken by Dr. Antonio Rodriguez is deemed upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the said Board has already
rendered its decision, the petition in No. L-26396 is likewise, dis­missed as
moot and academic.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="PONENTE">REYES, J.B.L., <i>Acting C.J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I am constrained to dissent from the majority opinion penned by
Hon. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, because it expresses principles
that, in my humble opinion, are contrary to the public interest.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1) In connection
with Administrative Case No. 2323 (which is the <span class="GramE">subject</span>
of G. R. No. L-26396), the majority opinion holds that the withdrawal (on 22
February 1963) by Dr. Antonio Rodriguez of the motion for reconsideration filed
by him eight (8) months previously, on 29 June 1962, against the adverse
decision of former Civil Service Commissioner Del Rosario, precluded the
latter's successor, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>,
from reconsidering the del Rosario decision, and barred him from rendering
another decision of his own in the same administrative case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Frankly, I fail to understand why administrative justice should
be fettered in this manner and treated as if it were the sole concern of the
official investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Questions of
official misconduct are of public interest and the people at large are as much
interested as the one charged that a petition for reconsideration be thoroughly
analyzed and that the attacked decision should be reviewed in order that full
justice should be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If errors were
committed to the prejudice of the respondent, the decision should be rectified;
but if he was unduly favored, why should the reviewing authorities not be
entitled to mete appropriate sanction if the first decision failed to do
so?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should the official under
investigation have power to <span class="GramE">brake</span> the course of
justice and cut off a review that he has sought himself, by withdrawing his
motion for reconsideration even if the reviewing officer has not finished his
restudy of the case?</p>

<p class="BODY">The practice of the courts has always been to the effect that
once a case or appeal is submitted for decision, its withdrawal should not be,
at the discretion of the party, but dependent on the assent thereto of the
adjudicating authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court
has held that:</p>

<blockquote>"After a case has been submitted,
appellants in order to withdraw their appeals must obtain the consent of the
adverse party or parties, or show that such consent is being withheld for
insufficient reasons, must make proper motion in this court, and must obtain
the leave of the court" (Dee See <span class="SpellE">Choon</span> vs. Stanley,
38 Phil. (1918), page 208).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We hold that the rule announced in
the case of Dee See <span class="SpellE">Choon</span> vs. Stanley (page 208, <u>ante</u>)
is applicable to criminal as well as to civil cases, and that, after a case has
been heard and is sub­mitted to the Court for decision, the appellant can not,
at his election, withdraw the appeal." (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.
  S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. Sotto, 38 Phil. 666, at page
677).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See also <span class="SpellE">Krivenko</span>
vs. Register of Deeds, 79 Phil., 461, 466, and Rule 50, section 4, Revised
Rules of Court).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration being in the nature of an appeal
against the decision sought to be reconsidered, the foregoing principles should
apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the proceeding is
administrative and not judicial is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that once the finality
of the questioned judgment has been arrested by a motion for reconsideration,
the reviewing officer should be given full opportunity to restudy the records
and satisfy himself whether justice has been done; and if convinced that it was
not done, to revise and correct the judgment as the interest of justice
requires, irrespective of whether the defendant will be favored or
prejudiced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public interest demands
no less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Spanish proverb goes,
justice is "no <span class="SpellE">mas</span> <span class="SpellE">pero</span>
no <span class="SpellE">menos</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, once the finality of a decision has been
already arrested, the complainants should not be barred from calling attention
to what they consider to be errors incurred by former Commissioner Del Rosario,
even if they did so beyond the period of 30 days fixed for filing motions to reconsider,
since the finality of the decision has been already precluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had Rodriguez not moved for re­consideration,
the duty of complainants to move for review within the period set by the law is
logical, because their failure to do so will cause the decision to become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since the finality has been
barred by respondent officer's own motion for review, no useful purpose would
be served by depriving the complainants of their right to file their objections
to the decision assailed by the other party, so long as they do so before a new
decision is promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice does
not neces­sarily consist in the absolution of the officer charged.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the obvious step for Dr.
Rodriguez to take in the face of <span class="SpellE">Subido's</span> adverse
decision was to bring his case to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, the body
expressly established by law<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to review and correct any erroneous or improper rulings of the Commis­sioner of
Civil Service as promptly and expeditiously as possible, and not run
immediately to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that to this
end the Civil Service Law of 1959 (Republic Act No. 2260) provided in its
Section 36 that appeals to the Board may be made by the party adversely
affected within 30 days from notice of the decision and that while a motion for
reconsi­deration shall suspend the running of the appeal period, <u>only one
peti­tion for reconsideration shall be entertained</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Section 32 of the Revised Civil Service
Rules prescribes that the Board of Appeals "shall decide all appeals <u>within
a period of 90 days</u>" after submission, and "its decision in such
cases shall be final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the
Regulations adopted by the Civil Service Board of Appeals exact, in turn, that
peti­tions for reconsideration should be filed by <span class="GramE">either
party</span>, appellant or <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <u>within 15
days</u> after notice of the Board's decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The time may be extended, but "<u>in no case</u> shall it exceed <u>five
(5) days</u>" and "<u>no second petition for reconsideration</u>
shall be entertained".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Expedi­tiousness,
therefore, is the watchword in administrative proceedings; and this is
understandable, for charges against officials 'affect the efficiency of the
government and the people's respect for it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Public interest demands that an innocent officer should be quickly vindicated
and restored to his post and that no guilty one should remain in office longer
than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well entrenched rule in this jurisdiction that -</p>

<blockquote>"No recourse to courts can be had
until all ad­ministrative remedies have been exhausted and special civil
actions against administrative officers should not be entertained if superior
administrative officers could grant relief" (De la <span class="SpellE">Torre</span>
vs. <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>, G.R. No. L-14907, 31 May 1960)."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rule in this jurisdiction is that
when an administrative remedy is provided by law, relief must be sought by
exhausting this re­medy before the Courts will act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to exhaust this remedy is
fatal." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Llarena</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, 108 Phil. 510, 512, cit. cases).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">And in De la Rea vs. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>,
G.R. No.</span> L-26082, <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">1 March 1968</st1:date>,
22 SCRA 953, 964, this Court, through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, reiterated the prin­ciple once more in the
following words:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . . . . . . . . In this connection, We deem it firmly settled
in this jurisdiction that prohibition and other extraordinary legal remedies
are not mere substitutes for remedies --- judicial or administrative ---
available to the aggrieved party in the ordinary course of the law; that if
through his own fault the aggrieved party failed to avail himself of the latter
remedies, he may resort to the proper extraordinary legal remedy only if the
judgment or order complained of is an absolute nullity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus public policy can not look with favor on any attempt to
by-pass the Civil Service Board of Appeals, and bring a decision of the Civil
Service Commissioner directly to the courts for review, as petitioner Rod­riguez
has done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The perennial clogging and
consequent delay of cases in our courts furnishes ample justification for the
norm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no <span class="GramE">excuse</span>
that petitioner wished to block the immediate enforcement of the Com­missioner's
decision, which the latter ordered to be executed pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it would be inherent in
the Civil Service Board of Appeals' jurisdiction to review and, when proper, to
reverse the appealed decision, that said Board of Appeals should be possessed
with discretion and power to restrain the immediate execution of the appealed
order, even if the law be silent on the matter; for otherwise, the prospec­tive
decisions of the Board could be rendered nugatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, if the Board would not
issue the restraining order, nothing pre­cluded Rodriguez from interposing in
due time an appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, while simultaneously
seeking injunction against immediate execution of the order of removal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the appellant could have obtained all the
requisite remedies from the executive authorities without need of immediate
recourse to the Judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in my opinion,
correctly dismissed the case brought by Dr. Rodriguez, for non-exhaustion of
administrative remedies before resorting to the courts for relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The appeal to the Civil
Service Board of Appeals is mandatory as it is an administrative body cons­tituted
by law to review the decision of the Com­missioner of Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when an adminis­trative remedy is
provided by law, relief must be sought by exhausting this remedy first before
going to courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
necessary, and as pointed out by the Solicitor General:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In order to provide an orderly procedure
which favors’ a preliminary administrative sifting process particularly with
respect to matters peculiarly within the competence of the administrative
authority.' The Civil Service Board of Appeals as constituted in this ju­risdiction
is better equipped than the Courts by reason of specialization, by insight
gained thru experience aside from the fact that the law requires that every
member thereof should have the same qualifications as justices of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is presumed that an
administrative agency like the Civil Service Board of Appeals if given a
complete chance to pass upon, the merits of the case will decide
correctly." (Decision, pages 4-5)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion declares that <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>
denied Rodriguez due process because the former ruled against the latter, on
the strength of his own answer to the second set of <span class="GramE">charges,</span>
hence, he was justified to immediate­ly resorting to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This observation is nullified by the fact
that Rodriguez himself annexed to his answer the documents upon which the
ruling of <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> was based (Annex AAA), without any
reservation as to their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
worse, after the <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> decision setting aside that
of former Commissioner <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, Dr. Rodriguez
never protested to Com­missioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> that he had
not been given a chance to explain the letter (Annex AAA) upon which he was
convicted of misconduct in office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did he demand a formal investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not here concerned with the merits of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido's</span> 1963 decision against Dr. Rodriguez but with its
finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the facts of record, I
submit that the decision of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>,
regardless of its merits, became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
for failure of petitioner Dr. Rodriguez to recourse against it to the Civil
Service Board of Appeals within the period fixed by statute, 30 days after
notice of the <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> decision; that his resort to the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, without previous
exhaustion of available administrative remedies, was legally impermissible and
could not arrest the finality of the <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> decision
finding Rodriguez guilty of misconduct in office; and finally, that the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Court of First Instance correctly dismissed the suit
filed therein by Dr. Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, by appealing to the Civil Service Board of Appeals,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="2">23 February 1966</st1:date>, two
years and five months after his case in the Court of First Instance had been
filed (in September of 1963)<span class="GramE">,</span> Dr. Rod­riguez
recognized and admitted that such administrative appeal was the proper remedy
for him to take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only he took such step
long after the expiration of the 30-day period prescribed by section 36 of the
Civil Service law for such appeals.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignoring the fact that
the administrative appeal of Dr. Rodriguez had been interposed over two years
late, in violation of the Civil Service law, section 36, the Civil Service
Board of Appeals took cognizance thereof, over the protests of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">What is more, as amply shown by the records of Cases G. R. Nos.</span>
L-27026 and L-27027, the Board would not even await the opinion of the
Secretary of Justice (the legal adviser of the Executive Department of which
the Board was a part) that had been requested by Commissioner <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Subido</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
on the question of whether the latter's 1963 decision had become final and <span class="SpellE">unreviewable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Board, over <span class="SpellE">Subido's</span> protests, went ahead, heard the
appeal in his absence, and reversed the decision against Dr. Rodriguez on <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="1">3 January 1967</st1:date>, just two days before
receipt of the Supreme Court's restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion would sustain the Board's high handed
actuations, on the basis of <span class="SpellE">Geukeko</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, 102 Phil. 706, where We ruled that the appeal from
a decision of the Director of Lands to the Secretary of Agriculture, after a
civil action had been dismissed, was still timely, in view of the adopted
policy of the Department to consider the filing of civil actions in court as
suspending the running of said (appeal) period of 60 days fixed by the Lands
Administrative Order No. 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is
altogether different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only is there
no similar policy declared by the Civil Service, but the 30-day period for
appealing, from a decision of the Commissioner to the Civil Service Board of
Appeals is one fixed by statute, and not by any Administrative Order that can
be modified by administrative policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no need, I think, to belabor the fact that administrative
authorities can not amend a statute; but unfortunately, the majority decision
implies that they can.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the Civil Service Appeals Board cites instances where
it has entertained belated appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
those appeals were ones forwarded and given course by the Commissioner, not
objected to by him, as this one was; and the delays involved were a mere matter
or days, while Dr. Rodriguez delayed his own appeal by over two (2) years and
five (5) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">The implications of the majority decision are far reaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, it lays the door wide open for
losing parties in administrative proceedings to seek judicial review as a means
to suspend or interrupt the period for the appeal of administrative decisions,
and thereby indefinitely block the execution thereof, to the prejudice of the
public service as well as of the legislative policy to expedite disposal of
charges against public officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, I dissent and vote for
the dismissal of the appeal in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-26396, and for the
granting of the petition in Cases G.R. Nos.</span> L-27026 and L-27027.</p>
