<p class="BODY">The factual background to this controversy is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 20, 1970, Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
died intestate, survived by herein respondents, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his widow, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>

 29, 1970</st1:date>, respondents instituted Special Proceedings No. 59-M
(5934), entitled "Intestate Estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>", before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Branch XV, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A period of six months, counted from <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1970</st1:date>, date of the first
publication of notice to creditors, was fixed within which creditors of the
deceased could file their claims against the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The six month period expired without any
creditor having filed any claim against the estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1971</st1:date>,
respondents executed a Partition Agreement, to which was attached an Inventory
of Properties and Estate Liabilities and/or Obligations, the pertinent
provisions of which read:</p>

estate have been formally filed in these proceedings, the undersigned heirs are

<p class="BODY">The Partition Agreement was approved by the trial Court in an
Order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="19" month="4">April 19, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1971</st1:date>,
respondents filed a Petition to Declare Proceedings Terminated alleging that
the estate and inheritance taxes had already been fully paid and that they had
received their respective shares in the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> in accordance with the Partition Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an Order issued on the same date, the
trial Court declared the pro­ceedings closed and terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 17, 1973, petitioner filed Civil Case No. 17660 against
respondents based allegedly on the latter's undertaking in the Partition
Agreement to assume and pay all the outstanding liabilities and obligations of
the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner claimed that sometime in January,
1965, Commercial Metals, Inc., a domestic corporation of which the late Vicente
A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> was a director, imported machinery for a
"one-way system hot dip tinning plant"; that it (petitioner) issued a
surety bond, on June 28, 1965, on behalf of Commercial Metals, Inc. in the sum
of P505,816.50 in favor of the Republic of the Philippines; that it issued the
surety bond on the strength of an indemnity agreement signed by the late
Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, jointly and severally with <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Laurel; that Commercial Metals, Inc. then withdrew
its imported machinery from the Bureau of Customs under said surety bond
without payment of taxes, duties and fees pending action by the Board of
Industries on the corporation's application for tax exemption and privilege
under Republic Act No. 3127; that on March 7, 1973, it received formal notice
from the Bureau of Customs that the petition of Commercial Metals, Inc. for tax
exemption was denied and demanding payment of the full face amount of the
surety bond; and that it wrote Commercial Metals, Inc. and the estate of the
late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> concerning the demand against
its surety bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sunvar</span>, Inc. was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as
party defendant in said case allegedly because some of the properties received
by respondents from the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
had been transferred to said corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner then prayed for the payment by respondents, to the full
extent of their respective shares in the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, of the sums of P505,816.50 representing the demand
of the Government against its surety bond with interest thereon at 12% per
annum from March 9, 1973; P21,803.61 as accrued or accumulated premiums and
stamps on the surety bond plus further accruing premiums and stamps of
P3,127.83 annually from June 28, 1973; and P100,000.00 as and for attorney's
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Answer to the Complaint, respondents raised the
affirmative defenses that the trial Court had no jurisdiction on the ground
that petitioner's claim should have been submitted and prosecuted in the
intestate proceedings of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>,
and that petitioner had no cause of action against them as whatever claim it
had was against the estate of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents likewise sought the cancellation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> caused
to be annotated by petitioner on the certificates of title covering the
properties received by them from the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 26, 1973, the trial Court issued an Order dismissing
the case on the grounds that the Court that took cognizance of the settlement
of the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> was the
one that had jurisdiction over the case and that petitioner's claim was barred,
pursuant to Section 5, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court, not having been filed
within the time limited in the notice to creditors in the intestate proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court likewise ordered the
cancellation of the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> annotated on Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. 348739, 348742, 348738, 397876, 397877 and 397878 of the Registry of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Its Motion for Reconsideration of the above Order having been
denied, petitioner filed the instant Petition, which was given due course in a
Resolution dated <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that the trial Court erred in concluding that
its claim is purely a money claim against the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, which should have been presented in the intestate
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It urges that its cause of
action is to hold respondents to their undertaking in the Partition Agreement
to assume and pay for all the obligations and liabilities of the late Vicente
A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, which may be prosecuted in an ordinary
suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this point, we agree with petitioner that its cause of action
is not a money claim against the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear
from the allegations of the Complaint that petitioner's cause of action is
based on what it believed was respondents' undertaking in the Partition
Agreement to assume and pay for all the outstanding liabilities and obligations
of the decedent, whether listed in the Inventory of Estate Liabilities or not,
in pro­portion to their respective shares in the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner's claim is not
against the estate of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> but
against respondents themselves in their personal capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In which case, it was properly prosecuted in
an ordinary action and was within the jurisdiction of the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue to resolve is whether the indemnity agreement
executed in favor of petitioner by the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>,
jointly and severally with his son-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
Laurel, who predeceased him, is one of those obligations and liabilities of the
decedent assumed by respondents under their Partition Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, petitioner's claim is not listed in the Inventory of Properties
and Estate Liabilities and Obligations of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, attached to the Partition Agreement, as one of the
obligations acknowledged by respondents to have been left by the decedent and
the payment of which had been assumed by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, petitioner argues that inasmuch as paragraphs 5(c) and 7(d) of
the Partition Agreement, hereinabove quoted, providing for the assumption by
respondents of all liabilities or obligations of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, omitted any reference to the Inventory in paragraph
4 thereof, those paragraphs were meant to include all other liabilities and
obligations of the decedent although not so listed in said Inventory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents, on the other hand, counter that
the liabilities and obligations mentioned in paragraphs 5(c) and 7(d) of the
Partition Agreement should be restricted only to those liabilities or
obligations of the decedent listed in the Inventory, as adverted to in
paragraph 4 of said Agreement, and that said paragraphs 5(c) and 7(d) merely
define the extent and proportion by which they assumed the decedent's
obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 10, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Interpretation according to intention;
general and particular provisions.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- In the construction of an instrument, the intention of the parties is
to be pursued; and when a general and a particular provision are inconsistent,
the latter is paramount to the former.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent
with it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, Article 1372 of the Civil Code stipulates that
"however general the terms of a contract may be, they shall not be
understood to comprehend things that are distinct and cases that are different
from those upon which the parties intended to agree." Similarly, Article
1374 of the same Code provides that "the various stipulations of a
contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that
sense which may result from all of them taken jointly."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that no claims were filed in the intestate
proceedings of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> within the
period fixed in the notice of creditors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner failed to file its claim even as a contingent claim in
consonance with Section 9, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legally speaking, therefore, all creditors of
the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> are forever barred from
prosecuting any claim against the estate of the decedent, pursuant to Section <span class="GramE">5,</span> Rule 86 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, respondents, aware that the
decedent did leave obligations and liabilities, the existence of which they
acknowledged and enumerated in the Inventory attached to the Partition
Agreement, personally assumed payment of the same in proportion to their shares
in the estate of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
thus clear that respondents intended to assume only those obligations of the
late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> which they acknowledged and
enumerated in the Inventory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they
specified:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That although no claim against the decedent's
estate have been formally filed in these proceedings, the undersigned heirs are
fully aware that the decedent left obligations and liabilities which are
mentioned in the Inventory, the payment of which is assumed by the decedent's
heirs in the manner hereinafter stated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Consequently, the phrase "all
liabilities or obligations of the decedent" used in paragraphs 5(c) and
7(d) should be then restricted only to those listed in the Inventory and should
not be construed as to comprehend all other obligations of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that "particularization
followed by a general expression will ordinarily be restricted to the
former" is based on the fact in human experience that usually the minds of
parties are addressed specially to the particularization, and that the gene­ralities,
though broad enough to comprehend other fields if they stood alone, are used in
contemplation of that upon which the minds of the parties are centered.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, the enumeration in the Inventory of the liabilities or
obligations of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, expressly
acknowledged by respondents and the payment of which had been assumed by them,
implied the exclusion of all others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Expressio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">est</span></span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span></u>.</p>

<blockquote>"Under the maxim '<span class="SpellE">expressio</span> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span>,' which, although more frequently applied in
the construction of statutes, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
is also applicable in the construction of contracts, the expression in a
contract of one or more things of a class implies the exclusion of all not
expressed, even though all would have been implied had none been
expressed."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, considering that the respondents themselves had assumed
the obligation of answering to creditors for the debts and obligations of the
late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, it is but just that they
should be bound only by the exact terms of their promise.</p>

<blockquote>"It is evident that in no contract may a contracting party be
obligated to more than what he has really bound himself and that the contract
should not be construed as including things and cases different from those with
respect to which the persons interested intended to contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1283, now Art. 1372, Civil Code)"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner's claim not having been
expressly included among the obligations of the late Vicente A. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> expressly assumed by respondents, as listed in the
Inventory, it may not, therefore, hold respondents personally liable on their
undertaking in the Partition Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is hereby dismissed for
lack of merit.</p>
