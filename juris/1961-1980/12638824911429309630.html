JUDGE MANUEL ROMILLO, JR., RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MUÑOZ PALMA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The complainant Dr. <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Bala</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> instituted this administrative
complaint against respondent Judge Manuel <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>,
Jr. then presiding Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoag</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in connection with an incident in Civil Case No. 3336-11 pending in said court
wherein he was a party litigant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
incident occurred on September 25, 1973 after complainant had traveled all the
way from <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City to attend a hearing scheduled
for said date before respondent judge only to find the courtroom closed, and
claimed that he was the object of offensive and insulting language from respondent
judge in the latter's chambers who ordered him and his daughter out of the
premises.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent filed a
verified answer to the complaint, stating that "he did not meet or
see" complainant on the date of the incident "neither in the
courtroom, my chambers nor elsewhere" and that he had "never met this
person (complainant); that it </span>"must <span style="">either be one of failure of memory of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>
by reason of senility or an outright malicious false accusation"; that
when the case was called for hearing at 8:30 a.m. on the date in question, only
counsel for plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">movants</span> appeared and since the
record</span> did not show that respondents (including Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>)
were duly notified, the case was rescheduled for the following month, and respondent
repaired to his hotel room to work on his pending decisions; and that he
learned afterwards from his then branch clerk of court, Atty. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span>, that complainant had arrived that same morning at
about 10:00 a.m. after adjournment of the day's session and that an altercation
had ensued between Atty. <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span> and complainant but
that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span> had assured respondent that he
(Atty. <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span>) had in no way by word or by deed
insulted complainant as averred in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the parties'
verified assertions were diametrically in conflict, the case was referred for
determination of the facts to Justice Buenaventura S. de la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span>
who after conducting the investigation, rendered the following report on the
evidence adduced before him:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At the date set for the initial hearing of this matter,
accompanied by his daughter, complainant appeared without counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was an old man with a defective
eyesight and had to be guided by his daughter as he moved about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, he resided at a distant place, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the undersigned deemed it best
for all concerned to proceed with the hearing after the complainant gave an
affirmative reply to the question whether he was willing to go on with the
hearing without a legal counsel and to present evidence in support of the
allegations in his complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of this, the complainant and his witness were allowed
by the undersigned to testify in narrative form, subject to cross-examination
by counsel for the respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portions of the transcript read as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Investigator:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Do you have a lawyer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'<span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>: </blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">'None,
sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Investigator:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Are you willing to go
ahead with this investigation even without a counsel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'<span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'If it can be done that way I am willing.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Investigator:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'You should have a lawyer to assist you in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'<span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'The question is how.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
almost nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't hire a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Investigator:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'At any rate, we will allow you to testify in a narrative form subject
to cross-examination by the counsel for the respondent.' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pages 2-3.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their testimonies, the complainant and his witness (his
daughter <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Bala-Florita</span>)
narrated the details of the incident, which appear to be substantially as
alleged in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
cross-examination, however, the said complainant and his witness admitted or
affirmed certain facts which, in the opinion of the undersigned investigator,
would readily show their inability or failure to identify the person who
allegedly shouted at complainant, using offensive language, at the CFI of <span class="SpellE">llocos</span> Norte on <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1973</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Regarding Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bala</span>, the 84-year old
complainant, the following were elicited during his cross-examination:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That he needed a
guide when he went to <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span> on September 25, 1973,
because his eyesight 'was poor' or impaired by two eye operations, the first in
1969 and the second in 1972, which 'clouded' his vision (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
page 11);<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in reply to
the question whether he would be able 'to point to Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>,
if you still remember him,' complainant admitted that he 'might make a mistake
because I am very sure that my eyesight at present, the way I see every person
or object is a little bit clearer than a shadow' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
page 12); and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That he 'did not
look' at the face of the judge when he allegedly got mad, making it 'very hard
[for him] to identify' said person (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pages 14
and 15).<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Likewise, his daughter <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Bala</span> <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>, under
cross-examination, gave some notable answers, among others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>asked if she knew the respondent judge, said witness volunteered to
'point to him,' pointing to a gentleman seated beside respon­dent's counsel
(Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ranada</span>) as 'Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>'
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pages 21 and 22); 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">she</span> admitted that
she was not familiar with the face of the said gentleman, having met him 'only
once' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., page 22); 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">she</span> was 'sure' about
her identification, as she in fact saw him at the corridor before the start of
the hearing (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. , pages 22 and 23); and 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">when</span> they inquired
about the hearing, the gentleman was called by the lady clerk, and she
'assumed' that he was 'Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>', alt ho he did
not so identify himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote the
pertinent portions of her testimony:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you know where Judge
<span class="SpellE">Romillo</span> is now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can point to him, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you please do that <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Florita</span></span><span class="GramE">?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Witness pointing to a gentleman seated beside counsel.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You mean to say you are
familiar with the <span style="">face of the gentleman
beside me now?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, I met him only once.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You met him only once
but you remember him to be the one whom you describe as Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span> in your testimony?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">'A;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And you are very sure of
that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why when I saw him this morning I
said he is Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When did you see him for
the first time this morning?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">'A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
corridor outside, near the security guard.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was about one hour ago.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And upon seeing him you
immediately recognize him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">'A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the first time
that you saw him on <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1973</st1:date>,
did somebody in the court room pointed to him as Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean, near the ante-chamber did somebody
point to him and said he is Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>? I am
referring to the gentleman beside me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was called by the
lady clerk and whom do you expect to go to about our hearing if not the judge
himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">So that, then he did not identify himself as Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>
but you assumed that he was Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">'Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'ATTY. RANADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'That will be all with the witness.' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pages 21 to 24.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The gentleman referred to, when asked to identify himself,
gave the following answer:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'I am Assistant Fiscal Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came here
to be a witness for Judge <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was requested to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, really I am the one with whom the
complainant had some sort of altercation and I really recognize the lady.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was then the Branch Clerk of Court of
Branch II, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, where
Civil Case 3336-2 was then pending Your Honor.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., page 25.)</span></p>

<blockquote>"Later on, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Madamba</span> testified
for the respondent, declaring that it was he, not the res­pondent judge, who
had a verbal exchange with the complainant on <st1:date year="1973" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1973</st1:date>, as stated in his affidavit (which was
marked Exhibit 1 for the respondent).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To give the complainant another opportunity to retain the
services of a legal counsel and to present such other evidence as he may desire
in support of his complaint, the undersigned investigator reset the matter for
another hearing on <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, no one appeared for the
complainant who, by letter dated March 17 (received March 26, at 2:00 o'clock
p.m.), informed the investigator that he 'cannot come with a legal counsel' and
that they have already 'pictured vividly ... the whole incident' in their
declarations of February 27."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court after a review
of the record concurs with the finding of the Investigating Justice that this
indeed was a case of mistaken identity and approves his recommendation for
exoneration of respondent Judge.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the respondent Judge is exonerated from the
charges and the case is hereby dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
