				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Filed as a petition for review by certiorari, the instant
petition was treated as a special civil action by Resolution of this Court
dated <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1976</st1:date> (p.
78, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition, petitioner complains against the dismissal by
the respondent Court of Appeals of his appeal from the decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> in Civil Case No. 4569,
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Santos vs. Philippine
National Bank, et al", for the annulment of foreclosure proceedings and
all incidents thereof, including the deed of absolute sale, and the Transfer
Certificate of Title (No. 85462) in the name of the defendant Maria Flores, one
of the respondents herein.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, among
others, dismissed the complaint of petitioner who, thereupon, interposed an
appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, after his motion for new trial was
denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground of the dismissal of the appeal by the respondent Court
of Appeals, as was also the ground of the "Motion to Dismiss the
Appeal" filed by the defendant Philippine National Bank in Civil Case No.
4569 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> is, as
the Resolution of the Court dated November 29, 1974 (pp. 17-19, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "D", Petition) states:</p>

<blockquote>"It is thus evident that the record on appeal suffers from jurisdictional
defects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no way from which to
determine when the period for appeal should commence and when it expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held by the Supreme Court, where nothing
is stated in the record on appeal regarding the date when the appellant
received the notice or copy of the appealed order or judgment, such omission is
fatal to the appeal (Government vs. Antonio, 15 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
119; Luzon Stevedoring Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 34 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
73; <span class="SpellE">Anota</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bermudo</span>, Jr.,
25 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 43).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such date is important in the determination of whether or not the record
on appeal was filed on time (<span class="SpellE">DBP</span> vs. Santos, L-26387,
September 27, 1966, 18 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 113)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ruling relied upon by the respondent court has already been
modified by later cases, among which are Krueger vs. CA, L-41063, January 20,
1976, 69 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 50; Villanueva vs. CA, L-29719,
November 28, 1975, 68 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 216; Pan American World
Airways, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, January 20, 1976, 69 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 36.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
uniform doctrine enunciated in these later cases, to the effect that the
failure to show on the fact of the Record on Appeal the date when the
petitioner received the decision of the trial court, and such other data to
show that the appeal was duly perfected, is not a fatal defect, the trial
court's approval of the Record on Appeal having served to cure whatever defects
or omissions there are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See also Garcia
vs. CA, et al., L-35234, May 26, 1977, 77 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 149;
Garcia vs. CA, L-34620, April 29, 1977, 76 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 609;

CA, L-37229, October 21, 1975, 67 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 304; Republic
vs. CA, L-40495-96, October 21, 1975, 67 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 322).</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the Record on Appeal (Annex "A" to
Petition, p. 32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) shows that, upon motion of
the petitioner for the approval of the Record on Appeal, which was alleged
therein as "having been filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period", the trial court approved the Record on Appeal (p. 114, <span class="SpellE">R.A</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this
fact clearly appearing on the Record on Appeal, the defect upon which the
respondent court predicated its dismissal of petitioner's appeal was deemed
cured and, therefore, cannot serve to give legal justification to its act of
dismissing the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, however, question the propriety of treating
the petition not as a review by certiorari, but as a special civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point to the fact that as an appeal by
certiorari, the petition was filed out of time under the provision of Section
1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"A party may appeal by certiorari from a judgment of the Court
of Appeals by filing with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari within 15
days from notice of judgment or of the denial of his motion for reconsideration
filed in due time and paying at the same time, to the clerk of said court the
corresponding fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition shall
not be acted upon without proof of service of a copy thereof to the Court of
Appeals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the face of the patent error of respondent court in dismissing
the appeal of the petitioner on a ground no longer valid in the light of the
liberalized doctrines laid down in more recent cases than those relied upon by
the respondent court, it would be a manifest injustice were the action taken by
said court to deprive, in an illegal way, petitioner's right to appeal, left
uncorrected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When compelling reasons
exist, as in this case, to depart from a strict procedural prescription in
order to attain substantial justice, such lapse of procedure would take on the
character of a mere technicality which can not be allowed to be a hindrance to
dispensing real and substantial justice (Gregorio vs. CA, L-43511, July 28,
1976, 72 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 120; <span class="SpellE">Obut</span> vs.
CA, et al., L-40535, April 30, 1976, 70 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 546;
Villanueva vs. CA, L-29719, November 28, 1975, 68 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
216; Rodriguez, et al. vs. CA, et al, L-37522, November 28, 1975, 68 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 262; <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span> vs. CA,
L-36629, September 28, 1973, 53 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 228).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In thus treating the instant petition as a
special civil action, the dictates of equity and justice have been what this
Court has harkened to, in obedience to the injunction of applying the rules of
procedure with liberality with a view to attaining substantial justice (<span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Doronilla</span>, L-34882,
August 24, 1976, L-35643, August 24, 1976, 72 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
