<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle2">As found by the Acting Referee of the

are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle2">At about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span class="CharacterStyle2">6 o'clock</span></st1:time><span class="CharacterStyle2"> in the morning of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="11"><span class="CharacterStyle2">30 November 1964</span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle2">, stevedore Pastor <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> went
to Pier 9, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="CharacterStyle2">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="CharacterStyle2">, to await the arrival of a barge of herein <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>, scheduled to dock at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9"><span class="CharacterStyle2">9 o'clock</span></st1:time><span class="CharacterStyle2"> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While </span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">thus waiting for the vessel, <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> had a
heated verbal argument with one Benjamin Valdez, another stevedore engaged by <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>, over the possession of a platform used
in the loading and unloading of cargoes taken into or out of the
watercraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>
was able to get it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the barge did not
arrive as scheduled, <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> went home for lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he returned at about </span></span><st1:time minute="0" hour="13"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1 o'clock</span></span></st1:time><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> in the afternoon, he found the platform again

the platform, but not before he had uttered threats against the life of <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
informed that the barge they were waiting for definitely was not arriving, <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>, with two companions, boarded a passenger jeep bound
for <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he got off from the jeep near his house, he was met by </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Valdez</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">,</span></span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> who whipped out a knife and stabbed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> fell to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was immediately brought to
the hospital, where he expired at </span></span><st1:time minute="30" hour="14"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">2:30</span></span></st1:time><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> in the afternoon

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">On </span></span></span><st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="3"><span class="GramE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1 March 1965</span></span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">,
the widow, Rosario <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>, for herself and on
behalf of her 3 minor children, filed with the Department of Labor a formal
claim for death compensation benefits against petitioner Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation for the death of her husband, Pastor <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company</span></span><span style=""> answered, denying the allegations of the complaint
and raising the defense of prescription, in that the claim was filed beyond the
3-month period from the death of <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>, as provided
in the Workmen's Compensation law.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">On
15 September 1965, after due hearing, the Acting Referee rendered judgment, ordering
the company to pay to the claimants death compensation benefits in the sum of
P6,000.00; P200.00 as reimbursement for burial ex­penses; P200.00, as
attorney's fees; and P61.00 as fees payable to the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award was based on the finding that <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> was an employee of the company and that death arose
out of his said employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
of prescription was rejected, it appearing that the company had failed to
controvert the claimants’ right to compensation within the period prescribed in
Section 45 of Act 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The company
appealed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, which affirmed the decision
of the Referee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when its motion for
reconsideration of said decision was denied by the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
the company filed the present petition for review, assigning as alleged errors
committed by the Commission its finding on the existence of employee-employer
relationship between the petitioner and the deceased and the ruling that the
right to demand compensation benefits has not prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
contention that there existed no employer-employee relationship between
petitioner and the late Pastor </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Rosa no </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">is premised on
the allegation that the latter was a "gang boss" working with the
petitioner on an "on and off" basis; that <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>
worked for petitioner when so assigned by the union, of which he was a member
that, if at all, the employer-employee relationship existed only whenever </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">deceased rendered actual service for the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Since on </span></span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="11"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">30 November 1964</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> was not able to work (because the
barge did not arrive), then, according to petitioner, he was not an employee
when he (<span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>) met his death.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no merit to this
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, while pe­titioner
company failed to submit any evidence that the work rendered by the deceased
was purely casual,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span style="">it </span>has
been established that prior to the stabbing incident the deceased, with other
stevedores, was in the pier prepared to do hauling jobs for the petitioner,
which work, it can not be denied, is connected with petitioner's business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is <span class="SpellE">un­rebutted</span>
testimony that the deceased had been doing stevedoring work <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">for said
petitioner for 15 years.</span></span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> Secondly, even
assuming petitioner's allegations to be true, that the deceased was a union
member, and that it was the union that furnished laborers and stevedores when
required by peti­tioner company, presumably with the latter delivering the
stevedoring charges directly to the union for distribution to the individual
laborers, these facts did not make the union an independent contractor whose
intervention relieved the said company of liability for the death of a laborer,
specially where no contractor's bond was required for the union's performance
of its undertaking.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The union here <span style="">was </span>ho
more than an agent of the company and whose function </span></span><span style="">is merely to save the latter from the
necessity of dealing with individual laborers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in this kind of indirect employment, it has been repeatedly held,
the employer is not relieved of liability under the Workmen's Compen­sation
law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is next claimed for
the petitioner that even if he were an employee, <span class="SpellE">Rosano's</span>
death is not compensable because it came when </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">was outside of the
company premises and not at work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not agree with the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the proved sequence of
events that took place on 30 November 1964 involving the deceased Pastor <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>, <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">it is evident that the cause of his fatal stabbing by Benjamin Valdez
(who was thereafter accused and convicted) can be traced to their disagreement
over the possession of a platform that was to be used in their work for
petitioner; that although the altercation started in the morning the same was
resumed when they returned in the afternoon and carried on when Valdez left,
lay in wait near <span class="SpellE">Rosano's</span> house, and there met and stabbed
the latter when he alighted from the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can it be said that the employer is exempt from liability under
the Workmen's Compensation law because the cause of death arose outside of the
company premises,</span></span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> whereas the
quarrel happened at the waterfront, at Pier 9.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For an injury to be
compensable, it is not necessary that the cause <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
shall take place within the place of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a workman is acting within the scope of
his employment, his protection "in the course of" the employment
usually continues, regardless of the place of injury.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, in one case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">an
employee went to the house of the employer across the warehouse where he worked
to get a drink of water; that there, while trying to drive away a puppy that he
saw eating fish in the employer's kitchen, he was bitten in the hand, as a
result of which he later died of hydrophobia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The death of the employee was held compensable, on the ground that his
trip to the kitchen was occasioned by the employer's fault in not providing adequate
drinking water at the warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
present case, it cannot be disputed that it is inherent in the stevedoring work
for the petitioner that the laborers, like the deceased, stay in the pier and
wait for the docking of petitioner's vessels.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Furthermore,
jurisprudence is to the effect that injuries sustained by an employee while in
the course of his employment, as the result of an assault upon his person by
another employee, or by a third person, no question of the injured employee's
own culpability being involved, is compensable where from the evidence
presented, a rational mind is able to trace the injury to a cause set in motion
by the nature of the employment, or some condition, obligation or incident
therein, and not by some other agency.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<blockquote>"The rule as stated by the Connecticut Supreme Court is that x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> when the employee is
assaulted while he is defending his employer, or his employer's interests, or
when the assault was incidental to some duty of his employment, the injuries he
suffers in consequence of the assault will, as a rule, arise out of the
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He will then be serving his
employer's ends and not of his own. (<span class="SpellE">Jacquemin</span> vs.
Turner and Seymour Manufacturing Co., Conn., 103 A. 115; <span class="SpellE">Goldhirsch</span>
vs. American Character Doll Co., 135 Misc. 817, 238 N. Y. 519)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Similarly,
in <span class="SpellE">Appleford</span> vs. Kimmel, 296 NW. 861, it appearing
that </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">a </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">theater employee's job required him to handle
disturbances in the theater; that several patrons were ordered by him to leave
the theater because of disturbances they were causing; and that after the
theater closed the em­ployee started for home and was subjected to injurious
assault by those he had previously ordered to leave; the court held that the
evidence sustained the finding that the employee's injury arose out of, and in
the course of, the employment.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">In
the leading case of Field vs. <span class="SpellE">Charmette</span> Knitted
Fabric Co., 245 N.Y. 138, where a superintendent was injured on the sidewalk by
workmen with whom he had quarreled in the mill, the late Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> (then of the New York Supreme Court) declared the
injury compensable, reasoning that the<span style=""> </span></span></span><span style="">quarrel outside of the mill was merely a
continuation or extension of the quarrel begun within; that continuity of the
case had been so combined with continuity in time and space " that the
quarrel from origin to ending must be taken to be one".</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
rationale applies to the case at bar, where the facts, shown by the evidence
found by the referee and affirmed by the Commission, are that <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> had been assaulted by the man with whom he had
quarreled barely a half hour after leaving the place of work where the quarrel
occurred, in connection with the possession of the platform to be used in
unloading cargo, without any independent agency or cause for the assault being
shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="">As pointed out by Larson (Workmen's
Compensation Law, Vol. I, section 29.21) -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">since</span> the
ultimate test applied by judge <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> was whether
‘the quarrel from origin to ending must be taken to be one’ it should make no
difference how widely separated the assault was from the em­ployment in time
and space if it remained an in­herent part of an employment incident."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Other cases applying the
same principle are collated in Schneider, Workmen's Compensation", Perm. <span class="GramE">Ed., Vol. 6, page 131, et seq.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">As
regard the defense of prescription raised by petitioner, it is true that the
formal demand for compensation for the death of Pastor <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span>
on </span></span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="11"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">30 November 1964</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style=""> was made by the
dependent widow and minor children only on </span></span><st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="3"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">1 March 1965</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">, or beyond the 3-month period provided for
in section 24 of </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">the </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">Workmen's
Compensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we are not
impressed by petitioner's disclaimer that it had no knowledge of the stabbing
incident prior to its noti­fication by the Regional Office of the filing of the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out that the
law does not speak of "formal notice" by the employer of the
accident; it specifies only "knowledge of the accident".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner to say that it had no actual
knowledge of the stabbing incident on 30 November 1964 would run counter to the
ordinary course of human behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
employer could scarcely have been spared the news of the killing of one of its
laborers by another laborer, especially where the cause <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
started in the place where the laborers gather and work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the widow went to the company premises
to demand compensation for the death of her husband a week after his burial,
she was able to talk to an unknown employee inside the compound, who told her
that she could not get anything because the death of her husband did not occur
in the company premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from
showing lack of knowledge by the employer, this fact constitutes sufficient
indication that the death of <span class="SpellE">Rosano</span> was already a
matter of common knowledge in petitioner's office that even an allegedly
unidentified employee could advance the exact defense that the employer later
set up in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="">The
fact remains that petitioner failed to controvert in due time the right of the
claimants to compensation, as required by section 45 of Act 3428.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="">And the rule is now well-settled that the requirements (for claimants)
of giving of notice of injury and filing of claim within the prescribed period
is non-jurisdictional and does not constitute a bar to compensation proceedings
if the employer, who had knowledge of the accident, failed to controvert the
claimant's right to compensation pursuant to section 45 of the law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> For such failure of the employer to
controvert the claim constitutes a waiver (or a forfeiture by law) of its right
to question the validity and reasonableness of the claim and precludes the
setting up of all non-jurisdictional defenses, such as non-compensability of
injuries, pres­cription, and the like.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
