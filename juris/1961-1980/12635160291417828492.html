and is now the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <st1:city><st1:place>Palma</st1:place></st1:city>
failed to pay the loan, DBP foreclosed the mortgage extrajudicially pursuant to
Act No. 3135 and, as highest bidder at the public auction held on <st1:date year="1951" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1951</st1:date>, bought the land and

on installments.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:place>Tri­nidad</st1:place>
then took possession of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Felix de Villa, having lost the duplicate of Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 50 surrendered to him by Fabricante and learning that
the original was lost in the Register of Deeds, filed before the Court of First
Instance of Camarines Sur,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
on June 12, 1948 a petition to reconstitute Transfer Certificate of Title No.
50, pur­suant to Republic Act No. 26, in favor of Cesario Fabri­cante with the
annotation of the mortgage in his favor as was allegedly contained in the
original lost.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After hearing, notice of which was served on Fabricante, the Court of First

the reconstitution, with the annotation of the mortgage in De Villa's
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said reconstitution was based on
the <span class="GramE">photostatic</span> copy of the deed of mortgage<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
in which the copy of Transfer Certifi­cate of Title No. 50 appeared.</p>

<p class="BODY">Seven days later, the Register of Deeds moved for re­consideration
and cancellation of the orders of reconsti­tution on the ground that Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 50 was found intact in the office but was already can­celled
by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 12 in the name of Eustaquio Palma who had
mortgaged the same to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The Register of Deeds also pointed out that in Transfer Certificate of Title
No. <span class="GramE">50,</span> was not annotated the mortgage alleged by
Felix de Villa.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

it appears that the Transfer Certificate of Title found to be
"intact" designated the land to be Lot No. 2 which certificate
originated from Original Cer­tificate of Title No. 34.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The title sought to be recons­tituted covered
Lot No. 9 originating from Original Certi­ficate of Title No. 183.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance de­nied the
motion for reconsideration on February 26, 1949, ruling that Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 50 which was found to be "intact" in the
Registrar's office covered Lot No. 2 and originated from Original Certificate
of Title No. 34 and was therefore different from the title certificate sought
to be reconstituted, which covered Lot No. 9 and originated from Original
Certificate of Title No. 183.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, reconstituted Transfer Certificate of Title No.</span>
RT-29(50) was issued in the name of Cesario Fabricante, with the mortgage in De

the land <u>three days</u> later from the incumbent possessor, Anacleto
Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1961</st1:date> De Villa secured Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 3347 in his name<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Anacleto Trinidad filed a forcible en­try case

resulting in the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction by the Justice of
the Peace of Iriga against De Villa and in his consequent dis­possession of the
property in favor of Anacleto Trinidad who, since <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1961</st1:date>, repossessed the land.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

against Anacleto Trinidad for declaration of owner­ship, recovery of the land,
and payment of P500 a day - the value of products allegedly being received by
Trinidad - as well as P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> worth of abaca plants
alleged to have been improperly cut, and the costs of the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the complaint was amended to include

from DBP, which had Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1115 in its favor, and
his possession of the land by virtue there­of, since December 29, 1951, until
De Villa dispossessed him of it; that De Villa's claim is barred by estoppel
and res judicata, as the issue was already decided in Special Proceeding No.
258; that the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3347 of De Villa was null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a counterclaim he alleged the
purchase price of the land which was P27,005.11; P60,000 spent in planting
abaca, P35,000 for coconuts, P2,000 for buildings, P1,500 as settlement of
squatters' claim, P1,200 for relocation, P8,000 for taxes or a total of
P134,705.11;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that when the plaintiff
took possession, the latter gathered P5,500 worth of abaca and coconuts and
destroyed P30,000 worth of plants;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that
to preserve the plants, defendants spent P50 per hectare a year for 300 hectares
or P15,000 annually;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that plaintiff cut
timber worth P5,944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recovery of
litigation expenses worth P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> and P10,000 as moral
damages, were further sought.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Development Bank of the Philippines also answered asserting
its right resulting from the foreclosure of Palma's mortgage, and claiming that
the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3347 of De Villa was void; that the claim
was barred by lathes, as plaintiff had not done anything from 1948 to 1962;
that plaintiff was barred from asserting;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the lot covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1115 of the DBP is
the same as the lot covered by Transfer Cer­tificate of Title No. 3347 because
he claimed otherwise when he petitioned for reconstitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DBP prayed for the dis­missal of the
complaint plus P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> as expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance, in its decision of June 5, 1964,
found that the mortgage in De Villa's favor had been annotated at the back of
both the original and the duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 50;
that Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-29(50), the recons­tituted title from
which De Villa derived Transfer Certi­ficate of Title No. 3347, covers Lot <u>No.
9</u>, Plan PSU 1185, and originated from Original Certificate of Title No.
183, <u>issued on January 30, 1920</u>, while the duplicate title issued to
Fabricante on which Palma's Transfer Cer­tificate of Title No. 12 was based, as
well as the Trans­fer Certificate of Title No. 1115 of DBP, covers <u>Lot No. 2</u>,
Plan PSU 11885, and originated from Original Certifi­cate of Title No. 34, <u>issued
on November 25, 1920</u>; that the two title certificates were issued covering
the same land and the rule is that the earlier in date - Original Certificate
of Title No. 183 - prevails; that the heirs of Trinidad acquired only whatever
rights DBP had ac­quired;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the
stigma of Fabricante's bad faith exten­ded to Palma and to DBP;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that there was no prescription, for
plaintiff's action was not one for recovery of title or possession but for a
judicial determination of owner­ship - as to which of them, both with valid
certificates of title, really owns the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, it stated in the dispositive portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the
plaintiff the exclusive and absolute owner of the property described in
paragraph 2 of the amended complaint and order­ing the defendants to vacate and
deliver the same to the plaintiff, to pay to the plaintiff damages at the sum
of P48,000.00 per annum re­presenting the value of the abaca fibers de­rived
from the land plus the further sum of P360,00 every two months representing the
va­lue of the harvests from coconuts, starting from the period beginning March
2, 1961 until possession of the property is restored to the plaintiff and to
pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The value of the useful improvements in­troduced on the land
by the defendants shall be appraised and deducted from the value of the damages
to be paid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendants appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals
which in turn certified the case to Us on the ground that the amount involved
is more than P200<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main points at issue for <span class="GramE">Our</span>
consideration is the ownership of the land, the presence of lanes or es­toppel
and the propriety of the award of damages by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a misrepresentation, Cesario Fabricante was able to obtain a
duplicate certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
grant­ing such certificate expressly stated that the original of the title was
still kept in the office of the Register of Deeds and ordered the issuance of a
new duplicate co­vering the land as described in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunate­ly, the new duplicate issued is
not in the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, its
contents may be known from Transfer Certificate of Title No. 12 issued in favor
of Eustaquio Palma which was based on Fabricante's newly-issued duplicate
certifi­cate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 12 covers and describes 5,724,415 square meters of land, designated
as Lot No. <span class="GramE">2,</span> Plan PSU 11885 surveyed on October 29 to
<st1:date year="1917" day="11" month="11">Novem­ber 11, 1917</st1:date> and is
indicated to originate from Original Certificate of Title No. 34, Decree No.
89686, registered on <st1:date year="1920" day="25" month="11">November 25,
 1920</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
the reconsti­tuted Transfer Certificate of Title RT-29(50) on which Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 3347 was based, also describes the same 5,724,415
square meters of land but designated it as Lot No. 9, Plan PSU 11885 surveyed
also on October 29 to November 11, 1917, but said certificate is shown to originate
from Original Certificate of Title No. 183, Decree No. 89686, registered on
January 30, 1920.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is possible
that a mistake could have been made with regard to the lot numbers, it is
unlikely that a mis­take as to origin of the titles and their dates of regis­tration
could also have been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
undoubtedly a case where two certificates of title were issued over the same
land in the name of different persons who were both in good faith in their
acquisition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There having been two titles,
it is understandable that the original upon which Fabricante's newly-issued
duplicate certificate was based did not contain the mortgage annotation in
favor of De Villa.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have laid the rule that where two certificates of title are
issued to different persons covering the same land in whole or in part, the
earlier in date must prevail as between original parties and in case of
successive re­gistrations where more than one certificate is issued over the
land, the person holding under the prior certificate is entitled to the land as
against the person who rely on the second certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purchaser from the owner of the later
certificate and his successors, should resort to his vendor for redress, rather
than molest the holder of the first certificate and his successors who should
be permitted to rest secure in their title.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, since Original Certificate of Title No. 183 was registered on <st1:date year="1920" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1920</st1:date>, De Villa's claim
which is based on said title should prevail, as against <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>'s
whose ori­ginal title was registered on <st1:date year="1920" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1920</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And from the point of equity, this is the proper solution, consider­ing
that unlike the titles of <st1:city><st1:place>Palma</st1:place></st1:city> and
the DBP De Villa's title was never tainted with fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">When, as a result of the sale at public auction, Fe­lix de Villa
was able to secure Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3347 in his name, his
rights were already pro­tected and he had the right to feel secure in
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his dispossession by Anacleto
Trinidad, he had all the right to come to the courts to seek redress and <span class="GramE">We</span> do not see any reason why he should be estopped from
doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor has his right of action
been barred by lathes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He possessed the
land from <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1961</st1:date>
until <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> ob­tained possession on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within a reasonable time thereafter, on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1962</st1:date>, De Villa filed the
present case for determination of ownership with damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts do not show that De Villa slept
on his rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to appellants' claim that the lower court erred in
holding that the mortgage was properly annotated and registered, suffice it to
say that the matter is one of fact over which <span class="GramE">We</span> find
no strong reason for reversing the lower court which gave credence to De
Villa's testimo­ny to that effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts and circumstances, however, do not call for assessment
of damages against appellants until after the filing of the present suit on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1962</st1:date> for only then could
they be positively adjudged in bad faith in view of their knowledge that there
was an adverse clai­mant to the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trinidad's repossession of the land on March 2, 1961 cannot be
deemed in bad faith as it was pursuant to a court order legally obtained, and
as his possession before that time was in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant does not question the specific <u>amounts</u> of the
damages awarded in De Villa's favor and the same, at any rate, is borne out by
the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said damages, however
should be offset against the value of whatever neces­sary and useful expenses
and improvements were made or in­curred by <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> with
respect to the land, provided that in the case of useful expenses or
improvements these were made or incurred prior to the filing of the present
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such reimbursable amount due to <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
must, therefore, first be determined before the aforesaid award of damages in
De Villa's favor can be executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
its determina­tion shall be by way of supplementary proceedings in aid of
execution in the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification that the damages re­coverable
by De Villa against Trinidad should date from and after the filing of the
complaint on January 26, 1962 until the property is restored to the plaintiff,
the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in all other respects;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and, accordingly, prior to the payment of the
damages in De Villa's favor, supplementary proceedings In aid of execution are
hereby ordered to he forthwith by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, to appraise
and determine the value f improvements and expenses reimbursable to Trinidad,
and thereafter to offset the two amounts respectively due to the parties to the
