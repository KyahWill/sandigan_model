of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, entitled
"<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home and Industrial Supply and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> vs. Associated Labor Union", and to restrain the
Honorable Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, as Judge of that Court,
from hearing said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner herein, Associated Labor Union hereinafter referred to
as ALU - <span style="">is
a </span>duly registered labor organization.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among the members thereof are employees of Superior Gas and Equipment
Company of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Inc. - hereinafter referred to as
SUGECO - a domestic corporation with offices at <st1:street><st1:address>Juan
  Luna Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

<st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">province</span></st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1965</st1:date>, ALU and SUGECO entered into <span style="">a </span>collective bargaining contract,
effective up to <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negotiations for the renewal of the contract
between ALU and SUGECO were begun prior to the date last mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While said negotiations were going on, late
in February, 1966, twelve (12) SUGECO employees resigned from ALU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the negotiations stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 1, 1966, ALU <span style="">wrote SUGECO requesting </span>that the twelve (12) resigned employees be
not allowed to report for work unless they produced a clearance from ALU<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">but </span>this request <span style="">was immediately rejected </span>by SUGECO,
upon the ground that it would cause irreparable injury, that the bargaining
contract had lapsed already, and <span style="">that
SUGECO, could no longer demand said </span>clearance from its employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">SUGECO
</span>intimated, however, that, should the twelve (12) men rejoin ALU, negotiations
"for the renewal of the collective bargaining contract" could be
resumed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the <span style="">same </span>dates;
ALU wrote SUGECO charging that the latter was bargaining in bad faith and that
its supervisors had campaigned for the resignation of ALU members, as well as
serving notice that, unless these unfair labor practice acts <span style="">were stopped immediately </span>and a
collective bargaining contract between <span style="">SUGECO
</span>and ALU forthwith entered into, the latter would declare a strike and
establish the corresponding picket lines "in any place where your business
may be found." Counsel for SUGECO replied to the ALU, on March 3, 1966,
stating that, with the resignation of the aforementioned ALU members ALU no
longer represented the majority of the SUGECO employees for purposes of
negotiation and recognition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1966</st1:date>,
ALU struck and picketed the SUGECO plant <span style="">in
</span><span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day, March <span style="">5, </span>SUGECO
commenced Civil Case No. R-9221 of the Court of First Instance <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
against ALU, to restrain the same from picketing said plant and the SUGECO
offices at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and elsewhere <span style="">in </span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, the Honorable Amador E. Gomez, <span style="">as </span>Judge of the Court of First <span style="">Ins</span>tance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Branch II, caused to be issued, <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>,
the writ of preliminary injunction preyed for by SUGECO.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
ALU preferred, in the Court of Industrial Relations - hereinafter referred to
as CIR unfair labor practice charges against SUGECO, its general manager, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> - hereinafter
referred to as <span style="">Mrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Lua</span> - and its two (2) supervisors, alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that these respondents had coerced and exerted
pressure upon the aforementioned ALU members to resign, as they did resign from
ALU, and that their <span style="">resignations were seized
upon by SUGECO </span>to refuse further <span style="">negotiations
with </span><span style="">ALU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1966</st1:date>, acting prosecutor of the CIR filed therein
against SUGECO the corresponding complaint for unfair labor practice.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, ALU had moved for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>
of the order of Judge Gomez, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="3">March
 5, 1966</st1:date>, sanctioning the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction against <span style="">ALU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was </span>later denied by Judge
Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, who <span class="GramE">presided</span>
Branch IV of the Court of Fir of Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1966</st1:date>, ALU
instituted Case No. L-25999 of the Supreme Court, for <span style="">certiorari and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, against Judges
Gomez and <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> and the SUGECO, and prayed therein
that the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> </span>be declared without
jurisdiction over the subject-matter of said Case No. R-9221; that the writ of
preliminary injunction therein issued be annulled; that Judges Gomez and <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> be directed to dismiss said <span style="">case; </span>and
that, meanwhile, they be ordered to desist from further proceedings in said
case, and from enforcing the writ aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="5">May
 16, 1966</st1:date>, we issued the writ of preliminary injunction sought by
ALU in L-25999.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1967</st1:date>, we rendered judgment
therein in favor <span style="">of ALU, annulling the
writ of preliminary </span>injunction issued in said Case No. <span class="GramE">R-9221, <span style="">On </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="3"><span class="GramE">March <span style="">5, </span>1966</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, directing respondent Judges to dismiss the same, and declaring

<p class="BODY">Soon after the <span style="">issuance </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the latter writ, ALU </span>resumed
the picketing of the SUGECO plant in <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it began to picket the house of
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">SUGECO'</span>s</span> general manager, and <span style="">her husband </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> - hereinafter

general merchandise, among which are oxygen, acetylene and cooking gas produced
<span style="">by SUGECO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home and Mr.
<span class="SpellE">Lua</span> - hereinafter referred to <span style="">as </span>respondents - filed a complaint, docketed as Civil Case No.
9414 of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, against ALU, to restrain the
latter from picketing the store and residence <span style="">aforementioned </span>and to recover damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Judge <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
issued an order requiring the ALU to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why
the writ sought should not be issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a memorandum filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1966</st1:date>
and a motion to dismiss dated <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="6">June 29,
 1966</st1:date>, the ALU assailed the Court's jurisdiction to hear the case
upon the ground that it had <span style="">grown out
of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">labor
dis</span>pute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, notwithstanding,
on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1966</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> issued an order the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1966</st1:date>,
respondents herein moved to amend the fore<span style="">going order so </span>as to broaden its scope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, on <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1966</st1:date>, ALU sought <span style="">a </span><span style="">reconsideration of

<blockquote>"Considering the evidence presented and the <span style="">facts </span>stated
in the previous order of the Court, it is believed that th<span style="">e </span>petition
is justified and that the acts complained of, if not restrained, will render

or other places; and</p>

<p class="2Q">"c) From preventing, obstructing or molesting the petitioners,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1966</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> denied <span class="SpellE">ALU's</span>
motion to dismiss Case No. <span class="GramE">R-9414 and to reconsider his order
and dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 30, 1966</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, or on
August 26, 1966, ALU commenced the present action for certiorari and
prohibition with preliminary injunction, to annul the writs of preliminary
injunction issued, on June 30 and July 22, 1966, in <span style="">Case No. <span class="GramE">R-9414 <span style="">and
to restrain the lower court from hearing the same.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">ALU maintains that the lower Court has no jurisdiction over Case
No. R-9414 because it had grown out of a labor dispute, is intimately connected
with an unfair labor practice case pending before the <span style="">CIR </span>and involves a strike the injunction against which had already
been lifted by the Supreme Court in <span style="">G.
R. </span>No. <span class="GramE">L-25999.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, ALU claims that even if the <span style="">lower
court had jurisdiction over Case No. R-9414, the writs of preliminary </span>injunction
issued therein are null and void, not only because of said lack of
jurisdiction, but, also, because it failed to observe the requirements of Sec.
9(f) of Republic Act No. 875, <span style="">as </span>well
as the provisions of Sec. 9(d) (5) of the same Act, requiring findings of facts
on matters enumerated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, respondents argue that the issue in the
lower court does not fall within the jurisdiction of the CIR, there being no
employer-employee relationship and "no labor dispute" between the ALU
members and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home; and that, at any rate, the
SUGECO products distributed and sold by <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home
came, not from the SUGECO plant in <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span>, but from
other parts of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents further deny that the residence of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>
was being used as a place to store and refill SUGECO gas for resale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents' pretense is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, Seaton 5(a) of Republic Act
No. 875<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
vests in the Court of Industrial Relations exclusive jurisdiction over the
prevention of any unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, for an issue "concerning terms, tenure or conditions of
employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in
negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or
conditions of employment" to partake of the nature of a “labor
dispute", it is not necessary that "the disputants stand in the
proximate relation of employer and employee".<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, in order to apply the provisions of Sec. 9 of
Republic Act No. 875, governing the conditions under which "any
restraining order" or "temporary or permanent injunction" may
issue in any "case involving or growing out of a labor dispute", it
is not indispensable that the persons involved in the case be "employees
of the same employer", although this is the usual case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 9,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
likewise, governs cases involving persons:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1) "who are <u>engaged in the same industry, trade</u>, craft, or
occupation"; or 2) "who <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>have <u>direct</u> or <u>indirect
interests therein</u>"; or 3) "who are members of the same <span style="">or an affiliated organization of employers or
employees"; or 4) "when the case involves any conflicting or
competing interests in a 'labor dispute' (as hereinbefore defined) or 'persons
participating or interested' therein (as <span class="GramE">hereinafter</span>
defined)".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, "a
person or association shall be held to be a person participating or interested
in a labor dispute if relief is sought against him or it" and "he or
it is <u>engaged in the same industry, trade</u>, craft, or occupation in which
such dispute occurs, or has a <u>direct or indirect</u> interest therein, or is
a member, officer, or agent of any association composed in whole or in part of
employees or employers engaged in such industry, trade, craft, or
occupation."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, then, there is no dispute regarding the existence of a labor
dispute between the <span style="">ALU and SUGECO-<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; </span>that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">SUGECO's</span></span><span style=""> </span>general manager, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>, is the wife
of the owner and manager of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lua</span>; and that <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home is
engaged in the marketing of SUGECO products.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, likewise, clear that as managing member of the conjugal
partnership between him and his wile, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> has an
interest in the management by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> of the
business of SUGECO and in the success or failure of her controversy with the
ALU, considering that the result thereof may affect the condition of said
conjugal partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, as a
distributor of SUGECO products, the <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Cebu</u></span></st1:place><u>
Home has, at least, an indirect interest in the labor dispute between <span style="">SUGECO</span> and the ALU</u> and in Case No.
<span class="GramE">R-9221.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, respondents herein have an indirect interest in said labor dispute, for
which reason, we find that Section <span style="">9 </span>of
Republic Act No. 875 squarely applies to Case No. <span class="GramE">R-9414.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Goldfinger</span> v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Feintuch</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>,<span style=""> </span>it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"Within the limits of peaceful picketing, however, picketing
map be carried on <u>not only against the manufacturer</u> but against a
nonunion product sold by one <u>in unity of interest with the manufacturer</u>
who is in the same business for profit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where a manufacturer pays less than union wages, both it and the
retailers who sell its products are in a position to undersell competitors who
pay the higher <span class="GramE">scale,</span> and this may result in unfair
reduction of the wages of union members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Concededly the defendant union would be entitled to, picket peacefully
the plant of the manufacturer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
manufacturer disposes of the product through retailers in unity of interest
with it,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>unless <span style="">the union may follow the product to the place where it is sold and
peacefully ask the public to refrain from purchasing it, the union would be
deprived of a <u>fair</u> and <u>proper</u> means of bringing its plea to the
attention of the public."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the ALU introduced evidence to the effect that the
SUGECO products had been brought to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home and
were being distributed in the latter, as a means to circumvent, defeat or
minimize the adverse effects of the picketing conducted in the <span style="">SUGECO </span>plant and offices in <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> respectively by ALU.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that respondents averred that said
products were purchased by <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Home <u>before</u>
the strike was declared against SUGECO and that some <span style="">of </span>said products were obtained from SUGECO in other parts of the
country; but, even if true, these circumstances did not place the picketing of

intent to picket "<u>any place where your business may be found</u>"

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apart from the foregoing,
it will be recalled that, prior to the expiration of </span>the collective
bargaining contract between ALU and <span style="">SUGECO,
</span>on January 1, 1966, negotiations had started for the renewal of said
contract; that during said negotiations, late in February 1966, <span style="">twelve (12) SUGECO employees </span>resigned
from ALU, owing - according to charges preferred by ALU and confirmed by a
complaint filed by a CIR prosecutor - to unfair labor practices allegedly
committed by <span style="">SUGECO and its </span>supervisors
who, it was also claimed, had induced and coerced said employees to quit the
ALU, which they did that, thereupon, SUGECO stopped negotiat<span style="">ing with ALU alleging that, with the
resignation of said twelve (12) members, ALU </span>no longer represented a
majority of the <span style="">SUGECO </span>employees;
that on March 4, 1966, ALU declared a strike and picketed the SUGECO plant in <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span>; that the next <span style="">day, SUGECO filed Case No. R-9221 of the CFI of </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which forthwith issued <span style="">a writ of preliminary injunction restraining ALU from picketing, not only
</span>the plant, but, <span style="">also, the SUGECO
</span>offices elsewhere in the <span style="">Philippines;
that said </span>injunction was dissolved by the Supreme Court on May 16, 1966;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the premises of respondents <span style="">herein
were not picketed until </span>after our injunction was enforced, subsequently
to May 16, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">This factual background reveals that, from sometime before
January <span style="">1, </span>1966 - when
negotiations for the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement between
SUGECO and ALU were begun - to sometime after May 16, 1966,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
or, at least, f<span style="">rom late in February </span>1966 - when the aforementioned unfair labor
practices were allegedly committed by SUGECO - to sometime before June 21,
1966,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
there was ample opportunity to store SUGECO products in respondents'
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, therefore,
reasonable ground for the ALU to believe or suspect that <span style="">SUGECO </span>was
using said premises to circumvent and blunt the ALU strike <span style="">and picketing in </span>the
SUGECO plant in <span class="SpellE">Mandaue</span> or to defeat or offset the
adverse effects of both.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge seemed to be <span style="">of </span><span style="">the opinion that, for the </span>subject-matter of Case No. 9414 to be
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIR, it was necessary to establish, <u><span style="">as a fact</span></u><span style="">, </span>the truth of <span class="SpellE">ALU's</span> contention that
respondents' premises were being used as an outlet for SUGECO products.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such view suffers from a basic flaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It overlooks the fact that the <span style="">jurisdiction of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">court or quasi-</span>judicial or administrative organ is determined by
the <u>issues</u> raised by the parties, not by their success or failure in <u>pr</u><u><span style="">o</span>vi</u><u><span style="">ng </span></u><u><span style="">the </span></u><u><span style="">allegations </span></u>in
their respective pleadings.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Said view would require the reception of proof, as a condition precedent to the
assumption of jurisdiction, when precisely jurisdiction must exist <u>before</u>
evidence can be taken, since the authority to receive it is in itself an
exercise of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
fails to consider that, to affect the jurisdiction of said court, or <span style="">organ, the main </span>requirement
is that the <span style="">issue
raised be a </span>genuine one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the question posed must be one that is material to the right of action
or which could affect the result of the dispute or controversy.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Such is, manifestly, the nature of <span class="SpellE">ALU's</span> contention
in the lower court, which should have, accordingly, granted the motion to
dismiss and lifted the writs of preliminary injunction complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, respondents herein have not alleged, let alone proved,
