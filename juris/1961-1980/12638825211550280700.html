<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court holds and
declares that the contract (Exhibit 'E') and the resolutions authorizing and
approving it (Exhibits 'A' and 'G') are ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span>,
null and void, and without force and effect, and the respondents are all
directed to refrain from enforcing or in any manner allowing the enforcement
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent City Mayor is

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Petitioners filed a motion for immediate
execution of the aforementioned decision on April 18, 1966, contending that the
case "greatly affects public interest and the injunctive relief granted in
the decision must be immediately enforced”, for "the delays occasioned by
appeal are such that they may extend beyond the terms of the respondent city
officials which will expire in 1967", and that "no amount of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bonds can adequately protect the public
interest that will suffer by non-enforcement of the decision";</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Respondents in Civil Case No. Q-8129 opposed
said motion for immediate execution on the principal ground that a writ of
immediate execution pending appeal can only be issued under Sec. 2 of Rule 39,
Rules of Court, when there are good reasons for doing so and there are no such
good reasons in this case;</p>

1966, ordering that "without prejudice to the appeal of the respondents

was elevated by <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction to the respondent
Court of Appeals which granted the writ and set aside the order in C.A. Case
No. 37968-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned decision of respondent Court of Appeals in C.A.
No. 37968-R now before us for review shows that three Appellate Justices<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
constituting the majority of a Special Division of Five believed that the
appellate court acquired jurisdiction over the case because the main case
included not only questions of law (validity of the contract and ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span> acts of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City) but
also questions of fact (whether or not therein respondents <span class="SpellE">Paculdo</span>
failed to meet conditions pertaining to sanitation of the market and to provide
for proper cold storage).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority
opinion held that "the question of the herein petitioners' (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City officials) supposed 'official excesses', which
have abetted the operation of the <span class="SpellE">Nepa</span>-Q-Mart, is
something best left for resolution in the main appeal".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently the appellate court granted the
petition and set aside the lower court's order of immediate execution pending
appeal, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending the Court's deliberation on the case for determination of
the issues, respondent <span class="SpellE">Paculdo</span> filed his
manifestation dated <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1976</st1:date>
furnishing the Court with copy of the lower court's Order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1976</st1:date> dismissing the
mother case as moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required to comment thereon, the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Government, through its city attorney, Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Torcuator</span>,
"express(ed) its conformity to the motion and manifestation of
co-respondents <span class="SpellE">Nereo</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Paculdo</span>
and Gloria G. <span class="SpellE">Paculdo</span> as well as to the Order of October
25, 1976 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch IX) dismissing the mother case for being
moot and academic'', as per its comment dated November 15, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in their comment dated <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1976</st1:date> filed through their counsel, Gregorio
R. <span class="SpellE">Puruganan</span>, likewise expressed their conformity to
the dismissal of the case for having become moot and academic as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An on-the-spot investigation conducted at the
premises of the NEPA-Q-MART Slaughterhouse owned by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Nereo</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Paculdo</span> confirms that
said slaughterhouse is no longer in operation, as stated in the certification
of the City Veterinarian of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City dated
September 9, 1976 which is attached as Annex '2' of said respondent's
'Manifestation' dated October 31, 1976;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Paculdo's</span>
market was burned down by the fire that took place on February 7, 1972, and the
undersigned counsel has found out that the present market was reconstructed
under the authority of Resolution No. 9314 passed by the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City on February 13, 1973;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents in the mother case below
(Civil Case No. Q-8129) include the former City Mayor and former Councilors of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City who are now no longer in office, and the acts
complained of by herein petitioners in the lower court refer to the contract
which was authorized and allowed by said respondents; there being a change of
the situation as of this date, the case has truly become moot and academic;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the fact that what remains pending
now before this Honorable Court is only the propriety of the lower court's
order of execution pending appeal, and said order being intended to enforce the
decision of the lower court which has become moot and academic, there are no
more acts which can be complained of by herein petitioners."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition at bar is dismissed for having
become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
