VS. ARTURO P. LOPEZ, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Respondent Arturo P. Lopez <span style="">is </span>sought to be disbarred upon the ground of
immorality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant Virginia C. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Almirez</span></span><span style="">, as­</span>sisted by her father <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Almirez</span>, charges him with
having succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her, under promise of marriage,
which he failed and refused to fulfill, despite a child begotten in consequence
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, respondent denied having ever had or solicited any
sexual relation with the complainant, but affirmed that they had agreed to be
married as soon as he became financially stable; that he could not carry out
his part of the agreement having discovered, on April 4, 1961, that complainant
was pregnant by another man; and that she filed the present charges out of
spite for him, in view of his refusal to marry her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon investigation conducted by the Solicitor General, to whom
the matter was referred, the latter submitted his report finding re­spondent
guilty as charged, and then filed the corresponding complaint for his
disbarment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer thereto, respondent reiterated, in effect, the al­legations
and defenses made and set up in his previous answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, moreover, averred that, while the matter
was being investigated in the Office of the Solicitor General, complainant had
filed an affidavit stating that he (respondent) is not the father of her child
and a motion withdrawing her complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent having, moreover, expressed the wish to introduce
additional evidence, the Court designated <span style="">its </span>Legal Officer-Investiga<span style="">tor
for the reception thereof, after which the latter submitted his report
concurring in the findings of the Solicitor General, although re­commending
merely the suspension of respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After fur­nishing him with a copy of this report, the case was set for
hearing, at which a representative of the Solicitor General and counsel for re­spondent
appeared and were given a period to file their respective memoranda in lieu of
oral argument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that respondent was admitted to the Philippine
Bar in 1957 and has been engaged in the practice of law in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After meeting the complainant - then about 23
years of age - in <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
- of which their families are residents - sometime in December 1958, respondent
courted her by correspondence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Presently, they be­came sweethearts. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Complainant having come to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in November 1960 and operated therein a store, in partnership with others,
respond­ent used to visit her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
he had told the complainant, as early as May 1960, of his intent to marry her,
it was understood that the wedding would take place upon consummation of a
given deal in which he expected to make a big amount of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From November, 1960 to April, 1961, they had
carnal knowledge of each other, several times, in various hotels in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
particularly the Palo Alto Hotel, the Springfield Hotel, and the Shanghai
Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1960</st1:date>, complainant informed respondent that
her menstruation was overdue, whereupon he caused her to be examined by a lady
physician, who found that she was in the family way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, he gave her some pills, to be
taken three (3) times a day, for the alleged purpose of hastening the flow of
her menstruation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he called her
up, day and night, to inquire about her menses, and, when the same did not
eventually come, he urged her to <span style="">see </span>another
lady doctor, who could perform an abortion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant was averse thereto, but, respond­ent was so insistent that
she went to the clinic of said physician.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The operation was not performed, however, for neither the latter nor
complainant were agreeable thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1961</st1:date>, complain­ant gave
birth to a baby boy, Francisco Arnold, at the Maternity and Children's Hospital
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior thereto, or late in February, 1961, their respective ap­plications
for a marriage license were filed and their marriage li­cense was issued on
March 13, but, the wedding, scheduled for March 18, 1961, did not take place,
owing to the absence of the Mayor who was to solemnize it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1961</st1:date>, complainant learned, from her sister-in-law, that respondent
had confided to the latter his unwillingness to marry her (complainant).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, soon there­after, complainant asked him
for his reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, respondent blamed her for
refusing to undergo an abortion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, or on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1961</st1:date>,
she filed the complaint herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">It further appears that on <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1962</st1:date>, while this case was pending in <span style="">the </span>Office of the <span style="">Solicitor </span>General, a motion signed by
the complainant, withdrawing her complaint, was filed with said office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given was that the complaint was
"a result of serious misunderstanding" and had been filed "in
the heat of anger" and that it would be unjustified to proceed further on
account of complainant's belief in his innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was, however, withdrawn by her,
on November 25, <span style="">1963, </span>for the
reason that re­spondent had secured her <span style="">signature
</span>thereto upon the assurance that he would thereupon marry her and that he
did not only <span style="">fail </span>to do so, but,
also, married another woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
respondent and one Evelyn <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Orense</span></st1:place></st1:city>
were married in January 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, respondent would have us believe that
complainant had freely and voluntarily signed her aforesaid motion to withdraw
her complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he added, she
made the affida­vit, Exhibit 34, stating that he is not the father of her
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In rebuttal, complainant
testified, however, that she signed said mo­tion and a blank sheet of paper,
which is now the <span style="">affidavit </span>Exhibit
34, he having convinced her that they would be married soon there­after.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He, likewise, </span>tried
to prove, through his testimony, that it was complainant who asked him to take
her <span style="">nightclubbing in Manila, </span>which
he did; that it was she who asked him, at the Bayside Night­club, on December
31, 1960, to marry her; that she reiterated this request in January 1961, for <span style="">fear </span>that her father may call her back
to <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span>; that she having brought up the same
subject in February 1961, they signed the necessary applications late in
February <span style="">1961, </span>and got the
corresponding marriage license sometime later, although the wedding, scheduled
for March 18, had to be postponed indefinitely because of the absence of the
officer who was to solemnize it; that after a drinking spree in Manila, in the
evening of April 4, 1961, he felt it would be unwise for him to drive his car
home to <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> <span style="">City,
</span>in view of which he decided to spend the night at the Shanghai Hotel;
that while there, he remembered having an appointment with com­plainant, whom
he, accordingly, called by telephone to apologize to her and informed her of
his condition and whereabouts; that soon later, complainant arrived
unexpectedly at the hotel and asked permission to sleep with him there, stating
that she had quarreled with her sister-in-law; that alter switching off the
light and undressing herself, complainant started massaging his head, for he
had a slight headache; that as complainant kissed him, he noticed that she was
pregnant and told her so; that after saying that she merely had a stomach ache,
complainant eventually confessed that another man had abused her; that angered
by this revelation, respondent dressed up and prepared to step out, but, before
he left the hotel, she asked his forgiveness and promised to behave thereafter;
that she went to his office, the next day, but he refused to talk to her; that
as she insisted upon talking with him privately, they went to an ice cream
parlor where she begged him to marry her and save her honor, sug­gesting that
their marriage would be in name only and that they need not live together, if
he did not want to; that complainant even said that her father<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
would give P5,000 if he, married her, but he rejected the offer and volunteered
to prosecute the man responsible for her condition, if she would identify him;
and that, when re­spondent still refused to marry her, complainant threatened
to bring disbarment proceedings against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review <span style="">of the
record, we agree with </span>the solicitor, who first investigated this case,
and the Legal Officer-Investigator, be­fore whom additional evidence were
introduced, that respondent's version is unworthy of <span style="">credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed, despite
the averments in his answers to the effect that he had never solicited or <span style="">had </span>carnal relations with the
complainant, his very testimony shows that they had met in a hotel room under
conditions attesting to a condition of intimacy clearly revealing past
extra-marital relations between them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, too, respondent's promise to marry complainant has been, not only
admitted by him, but, also, bolstered up by their applications for a marriage
license and the marriage license actually secured by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The breach of such promise on his part is thus patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, <span style="">when her pregnancy </span>was confirmed by a physician, re­spondent
firstly, persuaded the <span style="">complainant to
take some pills for the avowed purpose of hastening </span>the flow of her
"menstruation", and, eventually, urged her to have an abortion, to
which she did not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still,
when this case was pending in the office of the Solicitor General, <span style="">respondent </span>prevailed upon her to sign
a motion withdrawing her complaint, under the false allegation that he is
innocent of the charges <span style="">preferred </span><span style="">against </span>him, as well as to signal
blank sheet of paper - which now appears to be her aforementioned affidavit
Exhibit 34 - under promise to thereupon marry her, without the slightest
intention to keep it, because, instead, he married ano­ther woman soon later.</p>
