				<H3>TESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE DON ALFONSO DE CASTELLVI, ADMINISTRATRIX. NATIVIDAD CASTELLVI DE RAQUIZA, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. JOSE CASTELLVI AND CONSUELO CASTELLVI, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLANTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order  of the  Court of First
    
Instance  of  Pampanga declaring  that Jose Castellvi y
    
Bundalian  and his sister Consuelo Castellvi y Bundalian—
    
hereafter referred to  as the appellants—  have  no right
    
either  to share  in the  estate of the deceased  Alfonso  de
    
Castellvi  y  Hortega—hereafter referred to as the decedent
    
—or to take part in the present case, and that Natividad
    
Castellvi  de  Raquiza—hereafter referred to  as Mrs.  Raquiza—and the  Heirs  of Juan  de Castellvi  y  Hortega—
    
referred  to as  the collateral heirs—are the heirs of said
    
decedent  and,  as such, entitled to divide his estate  as
    
follows:  two-thirds  (2/3) for Mrs. Raquiza and one-third
    
(1/3) for the collateral heirs.
<p>  The record shows  that, upon petition filed by the decedent, in Special  Proceeding No.  5393 of the Court of
      
First Instance of Pampanga, praying for the adoption of
      
a child,  approximately 7-year old,  then called  Natividad
      
Cano y Soto—now Mrs. Raquiza—the latter was, on September 8, 1934, judicially declared to be the legally adopted
      
daughter of said decedent.   Subsequently, or on March 7,
      
1940, the latter died in Spain, whereupon his brother, Juan
      
initiated this Special Proceeding No. 6824 of the  aforementioned Court, for the settlement of the estate of the
      
decedent, as an intestacy.  Mrs. Raquiza was then about
      
13 years of age, and  under the care of Emilia A. Trono—
      
hereafter referred to as Trono—who objected  to the intestate upon that ground that the decedent had  left a last
      
will and testament, which she presented for probate. In
        
said document the decedent  declared that he  was  single
        
and had  neither ascendants nor descendants,  except his
        
legally adopted  daughter, now Mrs. Raquiza, to whom he
        
bequeathed two-thirds of his estate, and that he left the
        
balance  thereof,  or one-third of said  estate, to  his  aforementioned  brother Juan, or, should  he  predecease the
        
decedent, to their sister Maria Francisca, or, in the event
        
she shall, likewise, predecease him  (the decedent), to the
        
children of said  Juan,  the  collateral heirs above referred
        
to.</p>
<p> Alleging  that  they are  the acknowledged  natural children  of  the decedent and that the  latter "did not have a
          
sound dispositive mind  when his last will and  testament
          
was executed",  appellants opposed its probate on December 11,  1940.   On the  same  date, Trono was  appointed
          
<i>guarddan-ad-litem</i> of the present Mrs.  Raquiza and, purporting  to  act  on behalf of the latter, as party of the
          
first  part, she  (Trono) entered into an agreement with
          
the herein appellants, as party of the second part, stipulating, <i>inter alia:</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "1. That the Party of the First Part recognizes and
acknowledges that the Party of the Second Part are the duly
acknowledged natural children of the deceased D. Alfonso de Castellvi
during his lifetime, as his own children;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p>"4. That the deceased had inadvertently omitted the Party of the
                  
Second  Part from his last will and testament, unduly depriving,
                  
them of their legitimate as forced  heirs;</p>
  <p>"5. That in  the said  last will  and  testament, the probate of which
                    
is now pending in the Hon. Court of First Instance of  Pampanga,
                    
the deceased had left-two-thirds (2/3)  of his entire estate to the
                    
Party of the First Part, and  the remaining one-third (1/3) to his
                    
brother  Dn.  Juan de  Castellvi;</p>
  <p>"6. That in consideration of the  premises, to do justice and to
                      
show fairness to  the  Party of the  Second Part, the herein parties,
                      
assisted as  above  stated,  do  hereby covenant  and  agree  on the
                      
following;</p>

<p align="center"> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" (<i>b</i>)  That should  the provisions  of  the will and testament be
                          
    <i>enforced by the  Court</i>, i. e., two-thirds (2/3) to <em>the Party of the
                          
First Part  and  the  remaining one-third  (1/3) to  Dn. Juan  de
                          
Castellvi, then to carry out the just and spirit of  this  agreement
                          
the Party of the First  Part shall  grant unto  the Party of the
                          
Second  Part one-half (1/2) of that  which shall be allotted to her</em>
                          
out of the estate;</p>
  <p>"(<i>c</i>)  And  lastly that this agreement shall be submitted to the
                            
Court of First Instance of Pampanga to form part of the records
                            
of the case  therein pending." (Italics  supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After taking the testimony  of one of the  attesting  witnesses  to the will of the decedent,  the Court, by  an order
                          
dated  December 11, 1940,  admitted said will to probate,
                          
directed the "petitioner" to propose the name of  a person
                          
for  appointment as judicial administrator  of the estate
                          
of the decedent and approved the  agreement above  referred to.</p>
<p>Ten   (10) months later, or on  September  18, 1941,
                            
Trono  sought  a reconsideration of said  order, insofar as
                            
it approved the agreement, upon the ground  that  the same
                            
is null  and void  for the reason  that  she  had  allegedly
                            
signed it without knowing its  contents, that it was devoid
                            
of consideration, and that, as Mrs. Raquiza's<em> guardian ad litem,</em>  she  (Trono)  had no authority to enter into  said
                            
agreement.  The  motion for reconsideration was denied,
                            
although the order to this effect and the date on which it
                            
was issued do not appear in the records, because so much
                            
thereof as  existed at the time had been  destroyed during
                            
the liberation  of the Philippines in 1945.   Appellee maintains, however, that, pursuant to said  order, Trono was
                            
estopped from assailing the agreement  in question, she
                            
having  signed the  same,  and  its  annulment  could be
                            
secured at the instance only of Mrs.  Raquiza, through
                            
another guardian, and that, accordingly,  the order  contained a proviso "reserving" to Mrs. Raquiza  "the  right
                            
* * * to annul the agreement * *  * upon reaching" the
                            
age of majority "or  upon having another legal guardian."</p>
<p> On  July 14, 1946,  Mrs.  Raquiza,  represented by her
                              
husband, Atty. Antonio V. Raquiza, filed a motion praying
                              
that said order of December  11, 1940, be set aside and
                              
that the agreement  adverted  to above  be declared  null
                              
and void.  This motion  was  denied  on  August 8,  1946,
                              
upon the ground that the order  sought to be reconsidered
                              
had "already acquired finality."</p>
<p> Thereupon,  or on  October 18, 1946, Mrs.  Raquiza, assisted by her aforementioned husband and  then  <em>guardian
                                
ad litem</em>, filed  a complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 47
                                
of the Court of First  Instance of Pampanga, against the
                                
appellants herein, for the purpose, <em>inter alia,</em>
of securing a declaration of nullity of the agreement of December 11,
1940 and of the order of the same date approving it. After the filing
of appellants' answer to said complaint, the case was set for hearing
on August 6, 1947. Two days prior thereto, the Court received a
telegram of counsel for Mrs. Raquiza, praying for postponement of the
hearing and stating that the corresponding motion was "coming." No such
motion, however, had been filed when the case was called for hearing on
August 6, 1947, and neither Mrs. Raquiza nor her counsel appeared
before the Court on that date. Besides, counsel for appellants
"explained to ,the Court that the parties have practically come into a
tentative amicable agreement of the case * * *" and that the
non-appearance of Mrs. Raquiza "and her attorney may possibly be due to
this circumstance." Accordingly, by an order dated August 6, 1947, said
case was dismissed "without prejudice and without pronouncement as to
costs." (Exhibit N, Stipulation.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, the proceedings in the present case continued.
Decedent's brother, Juan, had been appointed administrator of the
estate, which, upon the death of Juan, was placed under the
administration of his widow, Carmen de Castellvi. After the performance
by the latter of the usual acts of administration, and feeling,
evidently, that the time had oome for the distribution of the net
assets of the estate among the heirs of the decedent, Mrs. Raquiza
filed, on March 11, 1958, a motion praying that appellants be excluded
from any share in said estate and from further participating in the
proceedings. Subsequently, or on August 5, 1959, said Administratrix
filed a motion praying that the following be declared heirs of the
decedent, in the proportion stated after their respective names, to
wit: Mrs. Raquiza, one-third of the estate; appellants, one-third of
the estate; and the collateral heirs, one-third of the estate. Passing
upon these two (2) motions, the lower court issued, on November 11,
1959, the order mentioned at the beginning of this decision, holding
that the records do not show that appellants are the acknowledged
natural children of the decedent; that appellants have not introduced
any evidence on their alleged relationship with the deceased; and that
appellants merely rely upon the agreement of December 11, 1940 signed
by Trono as <em>guardian-ad-litem</em> of Mrs.
                                  
Raquiza—which is null and void <i>ab initio</i>.  A reconsideration of this  order  having been  denied, appellants interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>The main question before us is whether the lower court
                                  
had  authority to pass, in the order appealed from, upon
                                  
the question whether or  not  appellants are related to the
                                  
decedent and entitled to share  in  his  estate,  as well as
                                  
to intervene  in  this case, considering that the agreement
                                  
entered into on December 11, 1940, had  been  approved
                                  
by an order of the  Court of the same date,  which  had
                                  
allegedly become final and executory,  no appeal having
                                  
been  taken therefrom.</p>
<p>In  this connection it should be noted that  the nullity
                                    
of said agreement is manifested.  Indeed,  being, as it is,
                                    
in the nature of a compromise made owing to appellants'
                                    
opposition  to the  probate of  the  decedent's will,  said
                                    
agreement  falls  squarely  within  the purview of Art. 1814
                                    
of the Civil  Code of Spain (Art. 2035 of the Civil Code
                                    
of the Philippines)  reading:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "No compromise can  be made  with respect to the civil  status
                                        
of persons, or with regard to matrimonial matters, or future  support."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Moreover,  the agreement had been  made without  any
                                      
consideration  whatsoever, insofar as  Mrs. Raquiza  was
                                      
concerned,  for:   1)  appellants' opposition to  the probate
                                      
of the  will  of  the  decedent, if successful, would have
                                      
innured<i> to  the benefit of Mrs. Raquiza,</i> since the collateral
                                      
relatives of the  decedent, who is survived by a legitimate
                                      
or adopted child, have no  right to  succeed him, in case
                                      
of intestacy  (Art. 946, Civil  Code of Spain) ; and 2)  the
                                      
share of the acknowledged natural children,  if any, is
                                      
deductible, not from  the  legitime of Mrs. Raquiza, as the
                                      
adopted daughter of  the  decedent,  but <i>from the free portion</i>  of his estate,  which is that bequeathed  in  said  will
                                      
<i>to his collateral relatives</i> (Arts. 840, and 942, Civil Code
                                      
of Spain).  In.  other words, appellants' opposition to the
                                      
probate  of the  will, if  sustained  by the lower court,
                                      
would have automatically <i>excluded said collateral relatives</i> of the decedent  as his heirs,  with the  possibility that the
                                      
appellee may, <i>in addition</i>  to her legitimate of two-thirds of the hypothetically intestate  estate, <i>get said free  portion,</i>if appellants fail to prove their status as alleged acknowledged natural children of the decedent.</p>
<p>Again, the  records indicate that appellants  had  very
                                        
slim  chances, if any, of establishing their aforementioned
                                        
allegation.  To begin with, the will of the decedent explicitly states that  he had  neither  surviving ascendants nor
                                        
descendants, except herein appellee as  his judicially adopted daughter.   Secondly, the statement in  the agreement
                                        
in question to the effect "that the deceased had inadvertently omitted" appellants herein, cannot be true,  for the
                                        
decedent declared in  said  instrument:</p>

<p>Lastly, Art. 131 of the Civil Code of Spain, which was
                                          
in force in the  Philippines  at the time of decedent's demise, provided that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * *  The acknowledgment of a natural  child must be made in
                                              
the record of birth, in a will, or in some other public  document."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In  the case at bar, the will of the decedent does not
                                            
merely <i>fail</i> to support appellants'  pretense.   It, also, <i>refutes</i> the same.   Furthermore, appellants do not even intimate that their pretense is borne out by their record of
                                            
birth, or by  a statement before a court of record, or by
                                            
any authentic instrument.  Neither  do  they claim  that
                                            
they were minors at the time of the death of their alleged
                                            
father, or that, subsequently thereto, a document, unknown
                                            
before, had been found, in which he expressly recognized
                                            
them as  his natural children, which are  the only cases in
                                            
which an action for recognition may  be brought after the
                                            
death of the  alleged natural father or mother (Art.  137,
                                            
Civil Code of Spain).</p>
<p>Appellants  maintain, however,  that the order of December  11, 1940, approving the disputed agreement,  had
                                              
already  become  final  and  executory, no appeal having
                                              
been taken therefrom and no other  remedy having been
                                              
seasonably availed  of  for the  purpose  of setting aside
                                              
said order.   In  this connection, appellants allege that, although Trono sought  a reconsideration  of the order  in
                                              
question, the  motion to this effect was not filed until over
                                              
ten  (10)  months after the  issuance  of said order, when
                                              
the same was already final  and executory, according  to
                                              
appellants herein.  In further support of this conclusion,
                                              
appellants Cite the  order of August 8, 1946,  denying the
                                              
motion of Mrs.  Raquiza of July 16,  1946—praying  that
                                              
the order of  December 11, 1940, be set aside and that the
                                              
agreement in question be nullified—upon  the  ground  that
                                              
said order of December 11,  1940, had "already  acquired
                                              
finality".</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, Mrs. Raquiza asserts the contrary, invoking, in
support thereof, the pre-war order of the lower court denying Trono's
motion for reconsideration of September 18, 1941, upon the ground that,
having signed the agreement of December 11, 1940, Trono was in estoppel
to question its validity, but allegedly reserving to Mrs. Raquiza the
right to seek the annulment of said agreement upon becoming of age "or
upon having a legal guardian". Although appellants now contend that the
existence of this reservation has hot been duly established, because
copy of the aforementioned order has not been introduced in evidence,
we are inclined to believe that Mrs. Raquiza's aforementioned
allegation is true, not only because appellants have not denied its
veracity—although they should know the truth about it, for being
parties in the proceedings, they must have received copy of the order
in question—but, also, because, when Mrs. Raquiza filed, on July 14,
1946, her motion for reconsideration of the order of December 11, 1940
(approving the agreement of the same date) <em>specifically  alleging  that her
                                              
right to file said motion had been reserved  by the Courts
                                              
in its  order denying  Trono's  motion for reconsideration
                                              
of September  18, 1941, appellants did not deny  the truth
                                              
of this' allegation—although the  facts must have been
                                              
fresher in  their minds at that time (1946)—and merely
                                              
averred that the reconsideration of said order of December
                                              
11, 1940, had already been  previously denied.</em></p>
<p> Regardless of the foregoing, appellants appear to rely,
                                                
in effect, upon the proposition that their status as alleged
                                                
acknowledged  natural children of the decedent,  and their
                                                
right to take  part as such in these proceedings and  to
                                                
receive one-third  (1/3) of the  estate of the deceased  as
                                                
their  legitime  are  already <em>res judicata</em>  in  view of said
                                                
order  of December  11,  1940, approving the  contested
                                                
agreement  of  the  same  date.  We  find  this  contention
                                                
untenable.</p>
<p> To  begin with, the order of  December  11,  1940 did
                                                  
not contain any declaration concerning either the status
                                                  
or filiation  of appellants or their right to  share  in the
                                                  
estate  of the decedent or to intervene in the case.   Whether appealed or reconsidered or not, said order can not
                                                  
be deemed, therefore, to have settled any of these issue.</p>
<p>Secondly, the agreement  in  question  merely provided
                                                    
that the same be <i>attached</i> to the record.   The parties there to <i>did not ask</i>
the court to render a judgement or issues an order in conformity with
the provisions thereof and enjoining compliance therewith, or even to
approve it. <em>Neither did they contemplate a judgment or an order in this
                                                      
case declaring that appellants are the acknowledged natural children of the  decedent and adjudicating to  them
                                                      
one-third (1/3) of his estate</em>.   On the contrary, it stipulated "that should the provisions of the will and testament
                                                      
be enforced by the court,  i.e., two-thirds (2/3) to the Party
                                                      
of the  First  Part"  (Mrs.  Raquiza) "and  the remaining
                                                      
"one-third" (1/3)  to Dn. Juan  de  Castellvi, then to  carry
                                                      
out the just and spirit of this agreement the Party of the
                                                      
First Part"—Mrs. Raquiza—"s<em>hall grant unto  the Party
                                                      
of the  Second Part</em>"—appellants  herein—"one-half" (1/2)
                                                      
of that which shall  be a<em>lloted  to  her out of  the estate." In other words, the parties to the agreement envisioned
                                                      
a judicial adjudication of two-thirds (2/3) of the estate</em> to
                                                      
Mrs. Raquiza and of  the  remaining one-third  (1/3) to  the
                                                      
collateral heirs, and, thereafter, an assignment  by Mrs.  Raquiza of "one-half"  (1/2)  of the share thus "<em>allotted to her" by the  court</em> in favor of  the appellants herein.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the judicial  approval  of  the  agreement was
                                                        
made in the  order allowing the  will to probate. Under
                                                        
our rules on  pleadings, practice and procedure, that was
                                                        
not the time for the court to settle the question as to who
                                                        
are the heirs of the decedent  and what their,  respective
                                                        
shares  in his estate  shall be.  An administrator thereof
                                                        
had not as yet been appointed.   In fact, said order directed
                                                        
the petitioner in the case to propose the name of a person
                                                        
for appointment as such administrator.  There being no one
                                                        
as yet  with authority to look for and take possession of
                                                        
the properties of the  decedent, administer the same,  pay
                                                        
the outstanding  obligations of  the  deceased  and  collect
                                                        
all debts due  to him,  and see to it that the interest  of all
                                                        
parties concerned be duly protected,  <em>the  Court  was still
                                                        
without authority to  proceed  with the distribution of  the
                                                        
estate. </em>In other words,  it had no jurisdiction to determine tile persons entitled to participate therein and their
                                                        
respective shares in the net assets of the estate, the existence of which net  assets was  still undetermined, and
                                                        
could not possibly be determined at that time.</p>
<p>It is  lastly argued that the status of appellants herein
                                                          
as alleged  natural children of the decedent had been admitted by Mrs. Raquiza in several  incidents in this case.
                                                          
More particularly: (<i>a</i>)  on  several occasions (on May 13
                                                          
and December 1, 1947 and September 10, 1948), she—thru
                                                          
either her<em> guardian-ad-litem</em> or her counsel—had consented
                                                          
to the  division of certain  funds belonging to the estate
                                                          
of the decedent into  three  (3) equal parts—one for her,
                                                          
one for the collateral  heirs and another for appellants;
                                                          
 (<i>b</i>) a manifestation  filed by her on November 23, 1955,
                                                          
contains, <em>inter alia</em>, a reference to the appellants as heirs.
                                                          
of the  decedent;  (<i>c</i>)
in two (2) documents (an agreement with the Philippine Trust Co., dated
September 27, 1955 and a petition dated October 1, 1957) Mrs. Raquiza
averred that she is entitled to one-third (1/3) of the estate of the
decedent; and (d) she gave her conformity to two (2) accounts of the
administratrix, which included some payments made to the appellants. It
would appear, however, that Mrs. Raquiza was then badly in need of
funds, and that she could not, or believed she could not have obtained
said funds from the estate of the decedent at least, as expeditiously
as desired unless appellants consented thereto. In any event, since the
<i>express</i> agreement  on appellants' status  is  null  and  void, as contrary to a positive statutory injunction, the aforementioned
                                                          
<span style="font-style: italic;">implied  </span>admission  can  neither carry more  weight than
                                                          
said  agreement nor  cure the nullity thereof.  The conformity of  Mrs. Raquiza to the  share in said fund given
                                                          
to the  appellants and  to the amounts  received  by them
                                                          
from the administratrix, according to said accounts, imply,
                                                          
at most, a  waiver of her right to  the specific share and
                                                          
amounts involved in the incidents aforementioned, and
                                                          
<i>no  more</i>.</p>
<p>  Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed,
                                                          
with costs against the appellants.   It is  so ordered.</p>
