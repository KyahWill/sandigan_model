				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila was taken originally to the Court of Appeals but was subsequently
certified to this Court, there being no question of fact involved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
January 18, 1961 the spouses Jesus Ruiz and <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sambenito</span> Ruiz executed in favor of the Bank of the
Philippine Islands a real estate mortgage covering a parcel of land situated in
Sta. Ana, Manila, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">security for a loan of </span><span style="">P15,000.00 </span><span style="">which they obtained from said bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage contract provided, among other
things, the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the parties of the FIRST PART, jointly and
severally, has/have applied for and jointly and severally obtained from the
party of the SECOND PART, a loan in the sum <span style="">of FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), Philippine
currency, to be amortized at the rate of not less than P300.00, including
interest on unpaid balance, at the rate of 8% per annum, said in足terest and
capital amortization to be effected at the end of each month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to pay </span><span style="">two </span><span style="">successive monthly amortizations
will cause this loan to be automatically due and payable in its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this loan
shall not run for, more than 5 years."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the default of the mortgagors <span style="">in </span>the pay足ment of twelve (12) successive monthly amortizations
(December 1961 up to and including November 1962) notwithstanding several
demands made on them, the mortgage asked the Sheriff of Manila to foreclose the
mortgage extra judicially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
the Sheriff set the auction sale of the mortgaged property for February 7, 1963
and notice thereof was published <span style="">in </span>the "Daily Record'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of a copy of the notice of <span style="">sale </span>the
mortgagors requested the mortgage to cause the postponement of the auction sale
and to give them tithe until March 15, 1963 within which to pay their
obligation, as well as the cost of the new publication of the sheriff's notice
of sale, if any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting the request,
the mortgage in turn made representations with the Sheriff to postpone the
sale, whereupon a new, notice was issued, resetting it for March 18, 1963 at
10:00 o'clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said <span style="">notice was again
published in the "Daily Record".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon
failure of the mortgagors to comply with </span><span style="">their </span>promise to pay, the Sheriff proceeded to <span style="">sell the mortgaged
property on March </span>18, 1963, as scheduled, with the mortgage as the
highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the mortgage's <span style="">bid of P15<span class="GramE">,173.74</span>
represented the total mortgage indebted足ness, </span>the Sheriff did not
collect cash but merely applied the same to the <span style="">amount of bid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 30, 1963 the mortgagors <span style="">filed </span>with the <span style="">lower court an amended petition for
certiorari, injunction, </span><span style="">and/or
prohibition seeking, as principal relief, the </span><span style="">annulment </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After proper hearing <span style="">the trial court rendered its decision dismissing the case for being
"devoid of any merit".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the appellants instituted the instant appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In seeking the reversal of the decision of the lower court the
appellants assign two errors, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) in not declaring the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage pre足mature
and therefore illegal; and (2) in not declaring the said foreclosure sale null
and void for failure to comply with the requirements prescribed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With
respect to the first assigned error, the appellants lay stress on the following
last two sentences of the provision of the mortgage contract quoted above, to
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to pay two successive monthly
amortizations will cause this loan to be automatically due and payable in its
entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this loan shall not run for more than 5 years."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Interpreting the above stipulation, the appellants claim that
despite the acceleration clause they had five years from January 18, 1961
within which to pay their mortgage debt because of the phrase
"notwithstanding <span style="">the
foregoing" in the last sentence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the five year period had not yet expired when the mortgage was
foreclosed, said foreclosure, they point out, was premature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's interpretation is totally without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To ascertain the meaning of the provision of
the mortgage contract relied upon by the appellants, its entirety must be taken
into account and not merely its last two sentences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the entire provision will
readily show that while the appellants were allowed to amortize their loan at
the rate of not less than P300.00 a month, they were under obligation to
liquidate the same within a period of not more than five (5) years from the
date of the execution of the contract; but <span style="">if </span>they should fail to pay two
successive monthly amortizations, then the entire loan would be due and
payable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that the phrase
"notwithstanding the foregoing" does not refer to the acceleration
clause but to the stipulation that the loan had to be "amortized at the
rate of not less than P300.00, including interest on unpaid balance, at the
rate of 8% per annum, said interest and capital amortization to be effected at
the end of each month".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
nothing inconsistent between the acceleration clause and the last
sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that the parties meant is
that while monthly amortizations could be as little as P300.00 the loan should
anyway be paid within 5 years; and that failure to pay two successive
amortizations would render the <span style="">entire </span>loan due and payable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, default having been committed
for twelve months, the foreclosure of the mortgage was not premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second assignment of error, the appellants challenge
the validity of the foreclosure sale on two grounds, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the "Daily Record" wherein
the notice of sheriff's sale was published was not a newspaper of general
circulation; and (2) that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank should
have paid cash for its bid since Section 5 of Act No. 3135 expressly requires
that the creditors must bid "under the same condition as any other
bidder."</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither of the grounds is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of extra judicial foreclosure of
mortgage the party alleging non-compliance with the requisite publication has
the burden of proving the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case the appellants did not present evidence to show that the
"Daily Record" was not a newspaper of general circulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly stated by the lower court:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the presumption is that the sheriff had
complied with his official duty according to law and this presumption includes
the presumption that the sheriff had caused the notice of sale to be published
in a newspaper of general circulation so that, if the 'Daily Record' is not a
newspaper of <span style="">general
circulation as petitioners claim, it is incumbent upon them to prove such fact,
which they failed to do."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the second ground, it was not necessary for the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, as the highest bidder, to pay cash to the
sheriff, <span style="">since
</span>the amount of its bid represented the total mortgage debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would serve no purpose for the sheriff "to
go through the ceremony of receiving the money and paying it back to the
creditor".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly the law-making
body did not contemplate such a senseless application of the law in requiring
that the creditor must bid "under the same condition as any other
bidder."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the decision appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
