				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The original jurisdiction of this Court is invoked on
certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Abdullah <span class="SpellE">Sangki</span>, official candidate of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party for Governor, and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Saludo</span> and Jose
Torres, official candidates of the same party for Vice-Governor and Board
Member, respectively, all of the province of Northern <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
seek the rejection of the election returns from all the eighteen (18) precincts
of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> and eleven (11) precincts
(Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 22, 24, 32, 35, 45 and 51) of the fifty-three (53)
precincts of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, both of the
said province of Northern <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner prays that a writ of preliminary injunction issue to
restrain respondent provincial board of canvassers (a) from including in its
canvass the election returns from all the questioned precincts; and (b) from
proclaiming respondent <span class="SpellE">Salipada</span> K. <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>, official candidate of the Liberal Party for
Governor, from being proclaimed Governor-elect.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1967</st1:date>,
we issued the corresponding restraining order in petitioner's favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Intervenors</span> <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saludo</span> and Jose Torres also sought pre足liminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their petition came
late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the winning candidates
(except for Governor) were proclaimed before respondent board of canvassers
could be restrained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before us for resolution, after hearing, on the
preliminary injunction issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments center, and in fact the merits of the controversy
as tendered by the petition and the returns, rest, upon the relevance to this
case of the doctrine of <u>statistical</u> <u>improbabilities</u> judicially
forged in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Climaco</u></span> L-25444, January 31, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's trenchant claim is that in all the eighteen
precincts of <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span>, the election returns
reported zero votes for him at the same time that these returns showed that all
the votes counted were in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Salipada</span>
K. <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>; that in twelve of these eighteen
precincts, all the votes actually cast were tallied in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>; that in the eleven precincts of <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span> heretofore enumerated, petitioner likewise received
identical zero votes while all the voters actually voting unanimously cast
their votes for <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>; and that in six of these
eleven precincts, the total number of registered voters equals the number of
ballots given to respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inter足venor</span>-co-petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Saludo</span> had
allegedly obtained zero votes in all the precincts above-mentioned, except one
in <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span>, where she was credited with two votes.
<span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span>-co-petitioner Jose Torres, candidate for
board member, appeared to have received zero votes, too, in the same precincts
except in one precinct in <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span>, where he garnered
100 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present proceedings, commenced on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1967</st1:date>, came about because, on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1967</st1:date>, the Commission on
Elections [<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>] by a two-to-one vote declined to
review the <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1967</st1:date>
resolution of the respondent board of canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That resolution denied the petition to reject
the aforesaid returns, upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In refusing review thereof, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> 's majority opinion, Commissioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Arranz</span> dissenting, adhered to the view that it has no power
to direct the board of can足vassers to reject said returns as its authority
"in matters of the provincial and local canvass is only supervisory in
character."</p>

<p class="BODY">As we go into the bases for the <u>statistically</u> <u>improbable</u>
doctrine hammered out in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Climaco</u></span>, <u>supra</u>, and assess the merits of
petitioner's and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>' position, we readily
read meaningful differences in factual setting between this case and that of <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>, the declaration
that the election returns therein questioned were "utterly improbable and
clearly incredible," and thus, should be rejected, emphasized that the
number of registered voters in about fifty precincts equal the number of
ballots reportedly cast and tallied for <u>each</u> and <u>every</u> candidate
of one party only - the Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> points out, which is
not denied by petitioner nor <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, that the
number of registered voters in the questioned precincts of <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pikit</span> is <u>not</u> the same as the number of
ballots cast and tallied for the position of Governor, Vice-Governor, <u>and</u>
other candidates of the Liberal Party.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>, too, all the
Liberal Party candidates were credited with exactly the same number of votes
while all the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party candidates received
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, only candidates Abdullah <span class="SpellE">Sangki</span> and <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Saludo</span> were shown to have received zero votes; other
candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party for other
positions voted upon were not blanked in the disputed returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fact which stands in bold relief is that
candidate Magnolia <span class="SpellE">Antonino</span> for Senator - who is <u>not</u>
of the Liberal Party - received in all the questioned precincts a liberal share
of the votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>, there was
uncertainty as to what happened to the vote of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party inspector in the disputed precincts, because the absence of his vote was
unexplained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, respondent <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> explained, through affidavits of a good number of
the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party inspectors themselves attached
to his answer, that some did not vote because they were not able to register as
voters; that two <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party inspectors in <span class="SpellE">Pagalungan</span> did not vote for candidates <span class="SpellE">Sangki</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Saludo</span> but for the Liberal Party candidates for
Governor and Vice-Governor because they "are more qualified than the
former two who are foreign to our Municipality;" and that other <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party inspectors believed that the Liberal
Party candidates "are more qualified than the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These averments, we
are constrained to say, reduce this particular point to a question of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">To support their prayer for the issuance of a writ of prelimi足nary
injunction, petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> concede that
their right to the relief demanded must be "clear and unmistakable."
But the foregoing would suffice to demonstrate that the right of petitioner to
the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is, after all, far from being
"clear and unmistakable." Indeed, the bare fact that candidates for
public office had received zero votes is not enough to make the returns
statistically improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> decision itself, Chief Justice Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, who delivered the majority opinion, did not say
that when one candidate receives nothing in an election return, such a
circumstance alone will make said return statistically improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in stressing the factual premise, this
Court there took note of the fact that "this is not an instance wherein <u>one</u>
return gives to <u>one</u> candidate all the votes in the precinct, even as it
gives exactly <u>zero</u> to the other." Rather, the fact accentuated is
that all the eight candidates for Senators of one party garnered all the votes,
each of them receiving exactly the same number; whereas all the eight
candidates of the other party got precisely nothing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> decision did
not really foreclose the possi足bility that a party inspector might vote for a
candidate of an opposing party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may
be read directly from the following statement therein: "It is, of course,
'possible' that such inspector did not like his party's senatorial line-up; but
it is not probable that he disliked <u>all</u> of such candidates, and it is
not likely that he favored <u>all</u> <u>the</u> <u>eight </u>candidates of the
Liberal Party." Deducible from this is that a no-vote for a particular
candidate in election returns is but one strand in the web of circumstantial
evidence that those election returns are "obviously
manufactured."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>, that circumstantial evidence was over足whelming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same does not hold true in this case; we
cannot, with certainty, conclude from the facts before us that the returns questioned
were "not true returns of legal votes actually cast, but simply manu足factured
evidences of an attempt to defeat the popular will."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, it cannot be said here - as this Court did intimate
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> - that respondent board of
canvassers may legally deny "<u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> recognition to such
returns on the ground that they are manifestly fabricated or falsified;"
or that "the fraud is so palpable from the return itself (<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ipsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>loquitur</u></span> - the thing speaks for itself)", such
that "there is no reason to accept it and give it <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
value."</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of this case suggests that we should not
unduly expand the reach of the statistically improbable doctrine carved out of
the facts obtaining in <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, we should say that respondent board
of canvassers - sustained by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> - in refusing to
reject canvass of the returns from the disputed precincts, properly performed
the functions allocated to it by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
did well in not over足stepping its authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following from <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Provincial</u>
<u>Board</u> <u>of</u> <u>Canvassers</u>, is worth remembering:</p>

<p class="BODY">"The board of official canvassers to whom the 'boards of
election of the several divisions return their certificate showing the number
of votes cast for each candidate, is liable to err in overestimating its
powers. Whenever it is suggested that illegal votes have been received or that
there were other fraudulent practices at the election, it is apt to imagine
that it is its duty to inquire into these alleged frauds and to decide on the
legality of the votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its duty,
however, is almost wholly ministerial to take the returns as made from the
different voting precincts, add them up, and declare the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Questions of illegal voting and fraudulent
practices are passed on by another tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The canvassers are to be satisfied of the genuineness of the returns,
that is that the papers presented to them are not forged and spurious, that
they are returns, and are signed by the proper officers; but when so satisfied
they may not reject any returns because of informalities in them or because of
illegal and fraudulent practices in the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The simple purpose and duty of the can足vassing
board is to ascertain and declare the apparent result of the voting. All other
questions are to be tried before the court or other tribunal for contesting
elec足tions or in quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> proceedings."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Aptly then does the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>
decision itself indicate to petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
the remedy in law - the corresponding protest in the proper forum, in this
case, the courts of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus totally unprepared to grant the injunctive relief
herein prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given</b>, we vote to lift the restraining
order heretofore issued herein, and to deny the petition for the issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction.</p>
