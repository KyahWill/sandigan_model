<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Direct appeal 
on points of law from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City, in Special Civil Case No. 322 of that court, 
dismissing the complaint of Maria A. <span class="SpellE">Gayacao</span>, for lack 
of jurisdiction.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On 
</span></span><st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="1"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 2, 
1962</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> appellant <span class="SpellE">Gayacao</span> had instituted action in the aforesaid court against 
the Executive Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the 
Director of Lands, and a private respondent, Felix <span class="SpellE">Alcarmen</span>, charging in substance that on April 3, 1935 
petitioner had acquired the right to purchase of residential Lots No. 55 and 56 
located at <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> 
City, through Miscellaneous Sales Application No. 8558, received by the Bureau 
of Lands; that upon demand she paid the installments then due, and the Bureau 
recommended approval of her application to the Department Head on October 
24,1939; and thereafter <span class="SpellE">Gayacao</span> improved the lots, 
paid the taxes thereon, and remained in possession thereof; that after World War 
II, respondent <span class="SpellE">Alcarmen</span>, a war refugee, secured <span class="SpellE">Gayacao's</span> permission to temporarily occupy part of the lots, 
but subsequently filed a Miscellaneous Sales Application No. V-8113 over Lot 55; 
that in 1949 the Director of Lands, without hearing <span class="SpellE">Gayacao</span> and despite her prior rights, gave due course to 
<span class="SpellE">Alcarmen's</span> application and excluded Lot 55 from her 
application", which action the respondent secretaries on appeal affirmed and 
sustained, in violation of Section 81 of Commonwealth Act 141, and prayed as 
follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Wherefore, petitioner prays that 
respondents be ordered to answer this petition, and, after hearing to order that 
the decision of the respondent Director of Lands, as concurred in with 
modification by the respondent Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources 
and the respondent Executive Secretary, over Lot No. 55 be annulled or amended 
so as to grant the whole of the same to your petitioner and not to the 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcarmen</span>; to order that due course be given to Miscellaneous 
Sales Application No. 8558 of your petitioner over Lots Nos. 55 and 56 to which 
she is entitled by law; to order respondent <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Alcarmen</span> to vacate the premises immediately; to order 
respondents Director of Lands and Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources 
to reject the application of respondent <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Alcarmen</span>; to declare: that all improvements introduced 
by respondent <span class="SpellE">Felixberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcarmen</span> on the residential lot covered by M. S. A. No. 8558 
of your petitioner, had been introduced in bad faith and subject to all 
consequences provided for by law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioner further prays for such 
other relief or remedy as may be deemed just and equitable under the 
premises."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The respondent public officials 
interposed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> City had no jurisdiction to entertain 
petitions for writs of certiorari or mandamus, nor issue such writs, against 
them because the administrative orders and decisions complained of were 
promulgated by officers holding office outside the territorial jurisdiction of 
the Court. They invoked section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act (R. A. No. 296, as 
amended) and the rulings of this Supreme Court in Acosta <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>, 109 Phil., 1017, and <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining Co. <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>, 
L-17109, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 30, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">). Finding the motion 
meritorious, the court below, by order of </span><st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 3, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
dismissed the petition of Maria <span class="SpellE">Gayacao</span>, and the 
latter appealed to this Court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are of the opinion that the 
dismissal of the petitioner's action is reversible error. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A careful analysis of the 
allegations made in the petition will show that the petitioner's principal 
complaint was that the decision of the Director of Lands, as affirmed by the 
Secretary of Agriculture and the Executive Secretary, was contrary to law in 
refusing to apply section 81 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, and in giving 
retroactive application to Lands Administrative Order No. 7-1. In other words, 
the remedy sought was the judicial review of the administrative decision in 
question and its annulment on account of errors of law allegedly committed. This 
power of judicial review arises from the doctrine of supremacy of law, which 
lodges in the courts inherent authority to decide the constitutionality of 
legislative enactments, and, therefore, the constitutionality of the exercise of 
the power delegated by the legislature to administrative agencies, and to 
enforce constitutional rights, in this particular case the guaranty against 
deprivation of property without due process (St. Joseph Stockyards Co. 
<i>vs</i>. U. S. 80 L. Ed. 1033; Grand Trunk Western Co. vs. Railroad 
Commission, 55 L-Ed. 786; <span class="SpellE">Sabre</span> <i>vs</i>. Rutland R. 
Co., add <span class="SpellE">Cas</span>. 1915 C 1269). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The doctrines invoked in support 
of the theory of non-jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Casta√±o</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lobingier</span>, 7 Phil 91; Acosta <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>, Supra; <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Mining 
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>, L-17109, June 30, 1961) are 
inapplicable, in that those cases involved petitions for writs of injunction 
seeking to control the actions of courts or officers outside the territorial 
jurisdiction of the respondent courts involved. Here the sole point in issue is 
whether the decision of the respondent public officers was legally correct or 
not, and, without going into the merits of the case, we see no cogent reason why 
this power of judicial review should be confined to the courts of first instance 
of the locality where the offices of respondents are maintained, to the 
exclusion of the courts of first instance in those localities where the 
plaintiffs reside, and where the questioned decisions are being enforced. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is easy to see that if the 
contested ruling of the court below is sustained the same would result not only 
in hardship to litigants of limited means, practically amounting to denial of 
access to the courts, but would also unnecessarily encumber the Manila courts 
whose dockets are already overburdened. Actually, since <span class="SpellE">Ortua</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, 59 Phil. 
440, the power of provincial courts of first instance to review administrative 
decisions of national officials, has been consistently recognized. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While the petitioner herein also 
prayed that the land authorities be ordered to reinstate her original 
application, such remedy is purely a corollary to the main relief sought; for, 
as the allegations now stand, reversal of the questioned administrative decision 
would necessarily lead to the same result. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF THE 
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
appealed order of dismissal is reversed and set aside, and the records ordered 
remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings in conformity with this 
decision. No costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
