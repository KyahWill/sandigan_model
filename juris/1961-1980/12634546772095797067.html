				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 5, 1962, Ramon P. Fernandez was appointed Collector of
Customs of the Port of Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
its face, the appointment was "Proba­tionary" and it stated that
"This appointment is good for a period of six months only from assumption
to duty."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> (Petition,
Annex "A") Said appointment was approved by the Civil Service
Commissioner, "as indicated on the face thereof." (Petition, Annex
"R") Fernandez assumed duty on June 18, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 12, 1962, Fernandez wrote the Commissio­ner of
Customs, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Following my original appointment as Col­lector of Customs of
the Port of Jose <span class="SpellE">Pangani­ban</span>, my probationary period
of six months will end on the 18th of this month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of this date, I have no permanent
appointment although ins­tructed verbally by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs
for Administration to continue on my job."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On January 10, 1963, Acting Secretary of Finance Rod­rigo D.
Perez, Jr. extended another appointment in favor of Ramon P. Fernandez, to the
same position, effective De­cember 19, 1962 (Answer, Annex "6").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said appointment was expressly stated to be
"<u>temporary in nature</u> and without prejudice to the final outcome of
the administrative case against Mr. <span class="SpellE">Democrito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Septimo</span>, former incumbent of the position."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> Ramon P. Fernandez continued occupying the
position in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 2, 1966, Ramon P. Fernandez was informed at a conference
by Commissioner of Customs <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> that his
appointment was terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
reiterated in a for­mal notice in writing on April 19, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1966, Customs Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>
issued Customs Personnel Order No. 513-66 ordering Alfredo de la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> (Collector of the Port of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>)
to assume the post of Acting Collector of Customs of the Port of Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> effective immediately but not to exceed thirty
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order was transmitted to
Fernandez on May 19, 1966 with a directive to turn over his money and property
accountabilities to De la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">De la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> reported to the office of
the Collector in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and assumed his new
position on May 24, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez,
however, refused to relinquish the posi­tion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, Fernandez instructed his personnel not to recognize De
la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> as Collector.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, May 25, 1966, Fernandez telegrammed the
Commissioner of Customs, questioning De la <span class="SpellE">Fuente's</span>
detail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 6, 1966, Fernandez filed the present action in this Court
for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> and mandamus with prelimi­nary
injunction, against Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> as Secretary of
Finance, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> as
Commissioner of Civil Service, Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> as
Commissioner of Customs, Alfredo de la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> and Job
P. <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span>, who is a de­puty collector,
is sued on the allegation that De la <span class="SpellE">Fuen­te's</span> detail
as collector for 30 days is designed merely to enable deputy collector <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span> to assume the position of collector after Fernandez
is ousted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents filed their answer on July 15, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Af­ter hearing, this case was submitted for
decision on De­cember 8, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">At issue is whether Fernandez's appointment was le­gally
terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first appointment extended to Fernandez was termed
"Probationary" and specified to be good only for six months from
assumption of duty, or until December 18, 1962, he having assumed duty on June
18, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was approved <u>as such</u>
by the Commissioner of Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequent­ly, Fernandez was extended merely a "temporary"
appoint­ment and he continued to perform his duties under said temporary
appointment, effective December 19, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is therefore no question that on April 19, 1966, when Fer­nandez
was notified that his appointment was terminated, he was holding merely a
temporary appointment, which is ter­minable at any time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
and mandamus is hereby denied, with costs.</p>
