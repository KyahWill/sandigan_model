				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the order of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission in RO5-WC Case No. 140 entitled "Florencio
Diamante, Claimant, versus, Franklin Baker Company of the Philippines,
Respondent" dated July 16, 1968, granting the motion of private respondent
Flo­rencio Diamante for reimbursement of medical expenses in the amount of
P1,275.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts, as stated by
the petitioner in its brief, are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Respondent-claimant was employed as sheller the Shelling
Department of herein petitioner.  Having
contracted the disease of pulmonary tuberculosis, respondent-claimant
originally filed a <span style="">compensation claim
before the Regional</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Office No. 5 in San Pablo
City which was docketed as RO5-WC Case No. 140.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In due time hearing <span style="">was </span>made
and a favorable decision was rendered awarding benefits to the claimant.  After exhausting an appeal to the Commission
<u>en</u> <u>banc</u> which affirmed the Referee's <span style="">decision, petitioner </span>herein satisfied the decision and paid the
claimant his corresponding weekly compensation benefits for 208 weeks which
period terminated on September 4, 1963.  A report to this effect was made by herein petitioner on Septem­ber 13,
1963 (mentioned in the dis­senting opinion of Commissioner Sotto, Annex 'G' to
Petition also page 4, Decision, Franklin Baker Com­pany vs. Diamante, et al.,
G.R. No. L-22206, October 31, 1967).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>After the satisfaction of the decision in the original claim,
respondent-claimant then filed a Petition for Extension of Period of
Compensation on October 8, 1963, alleging, among other things, that the
'claimant is still under treatment by the respondent com­pany <span style="">physician.' This </span>later became the
subject <span style="">of </span>a Petition for Review
before the Honorable Court (G.R. No. L-22206) and later decided in claimant's
favor.  Pending determination of the
aforesaid Petition for Extension of Period of Compensation, respondent-claimant
filed on November 8, 1963, his Motion for Re­imbursement (Annexes 'A' and 'A-1'
to the Petition).  After the dismissal
of this Motion for Reimbursement by the then Commissioner Cesareo Perez (Annex
'B', Petition) respondent-claimant filed his Motion for Reconsideration (Annex
'C', Petition) to which herein petitioner filed an opposition averring that the
decision has <span style="">long </span>become final
and has made no mention of medical expenses and that at most, it was a
forgotten evi­dence which was not a proper ground to reopen the case.  (Annex 'D', Petition)</blockquote>

<blockquote>In a resolution dated July 16, 1968, respondent Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> granted claimant's Motion for Reimbursement (An­nexes 'E' and 'F',
Petition), thus prompt­ing petitioner herein to file the instant Petition for
Review with this Honorable Supreme Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner assigns the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>"THAT THE HONORABLE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION ERRED IN
GRANTING RESPONDENT CLAIMANT'S MOTION FOR REIMBURSEMENT AFTER THE CASE HAS LONG
BEEN DECIDED, TERMINATED AND JUDGMENT THEREON SATIS­FIED; AND</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>"THAT THE RESPONDENT WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION ERRED <span style="">IN SUM­</span>MARILY GRANTING
RESPONDENT-CLAIMANT'S MOTION FOR REIMBURSEMENT WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF A
HEARING."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the Workmen's Compensation Com­mission had no
more authority to grant claimant's motion for reimbursement of medical expenses
because the main case had already long been decided and terminated has no
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case is not a claim for disability compensation but
is merely a claim for reimbursement of me­dical expenses which is only a
corollary to the decision of the second claim declaring that the illness of the
private respondent, Florencio Diamante, was still work-connected and,
therefore, compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Case No. 140, the decision of Associate Commis­sioner Sanchez
dated December 19, 1962 which required the petitioner company to provide the
private respondent such necessary medical services until his ailment of PTB was
arrested or cured as a corollary to its declaration that the ailment was
compensable, was sustained by the Workmen's Compensation Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
in a resolution dated January 15, 1963.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the decision in
Case No. 140 had become final and executory and after the petitioner had paid
the private respondent his weekly compensation for a period of 208 weeks, the
Workmen's Compensation Commission, sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, upon petition
of the private respondent Diamante for extension of the period of compensation,
issued an order dated November 6, 1963 extending the period of compensation of
the claimant beyond 208 weeks provided the amount of com­pensation should not
exceed the amount of P4,000.00.  This
resolution of the Workmen's Compensation Commission was affirmed by the Supreme
Court in its decision promulgated on October 31, 1967 in G.R. No. L-22206
because:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This Court, in a previous case, held that where the employer
has paid compensation in accordance with the decision of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, the compensability of the case is no longer open to <span style="">question and there is no more neces­sity for
a formal hearing.  With more reason
should it be when the employer itself as in the present case, has provided
claimant with further medi­cal assistance, incontrovertibly evidencing
claimant's further incapacity for work - a circumstance that cer­tainly
justified an extension of the period of compensation.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The law is clear.  Under
Section 18 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission is authorized to reopen a case in order to grant an
extension of the period of compensation, provided the total amount awarded as
compensa­tion does not exceed four thousand pesos.  The pertinent portion of Section 18 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act, as amended, upon which the Workmen's Com­pensation relied in granting the
exten­sion of the period of compensation, reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'x x x Provided, however, That after the payment had been made for
the period specified by the Act in each case, the Workmen's Compensation Com­missioner
may from time to time cause the examination of the condition of the disabled
laborer, with a view to extend<span style="">ing, if
necessary, the period of compensation which shall not, however, ex­ceed the
said amount of four thousand </span><span style="">pesos.'</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Therefore, the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> in issuing </span>its order dated <span style="">November 6, </span>1963, without any formal hearing, could not be
considered as having acted with grave abuse of discretion or without due
process of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The award of compensation which has been satisfied may still be
reopened on petition for extension of the period of compensation; and, a period
for payment of compensation that has already expired may further be extended,
provided the total compensation awarded does not ex­ceed four thousand pesos as
provided for in section 18 of the Workmen's Compensa<span style="">tion Act, although the extension goes beyond the 208 weeks provided </span>for
in Section 14 of the same Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the motion for reimbursement was filed on
November 19, 1963 while the appeal before this Court was pending.  In granting the motion of claimant for
reimbursement of medical expenses, the Com­mission was only implementing its
decision in Case No. 140 which directed the petitioner to furnish the private
respondent the necessary medical services.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the petitioner was furnished a copy of the
motion for reimbursement.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Attached to said motion was the receipt of the Brion Clinic for the amount of
P1,275.00 representing the cost of medicine and medical fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It also appears that the petitioner was furnished a copy of the
motion for reconsideration dated January 3, 1966 filed by the private
respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the petitioner filed its opposition dated January 12,
1966 to the motion for reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus seen that the petitioner was given all the opportunity
to question the receipt of the Brion Clinic which was attached to the motion
for reimbursement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a similar case,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> the
Supreme Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In a previous case involving the same parties now before this
Court, We affirmed the decision dated December 6, 1961 of the respondent
commission order­ing the transportation company to pay P4,000.00 in lump sum as
compensation to the respondent Tomas Perez and to provide the latter with
'medical, sur­gical and hospital services and sup<span style="">plies as the nature of his illness may require until said ailment is
arrested or cured, pursuant to Section 13 of the Act.’</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter the respondent claim­ant filed with the respondent
Commis­sion a motion dated December 3, 1964 seeking to recover from the
transpor­tation company the amount of P4,760.00 he allegedly spent from October
1, 1960 to December 1, 1964 for his medical and hospital services and supplies
as re­quired by the nature of his illness, to the reimbursement of which
according to him he was entitled under the aforequoted decision.  A supplementary motion for reimbursement of
the amount of P480.00 <span style="">as </span>medical expenses incurred from December 1, 1964 to March,
1965 was subsequently filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The transportation company filed its opposition on the ground that
it had likewise complied with that portion of the decision in question when its
coun­sel sent a letter dated November 18, 1964 to the respondent Commission
requesting the issuance of an order directing the respondent claimant 'to
report to the Buenafe Clinic for medical check-up or, if necessary, confinement
and treatment.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 6, 1966 the respondent Commission, through Chairman
N. Baens del Rosario, issued an order requiring the transportation company 'to
reimburse claimant Tomas Perez the sum of THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY
PESOS (P3,240), as medical expenses x x x' incurred from October 1960 to March
1965.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In due time the transportation com­pany moved to reconsider,
but the motion was denied by the respondent Commission in its resolution dated
June 27, 1966.  Hence, this petition for
review.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The principal argument against the order awarding
reimbursement to the res­pondent claimant for his alleged medical expenses is
that it is a modification of the second part of the dispositive portion of the
decision in G.R. No. L-19522 directing the petitioner company to provide the
respondent claimant with medical, sur­gical and hospital services and supplies
as hereinbefore quoted.  It further in­sists
that it 'took the necessary steps with a view to complying with the afore­said
portion of the decision' when its counsel sent a letter dated November 18, <span style="">1964 to the respondent Commission, which
letter is hereunder quoted in part:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In connection with the furnishing of medical, sur­gical and
hospital services required of our client by the decision, we request that an
order be issued directing Tomas Perez to report to the Buenafe Clinic in
Batangas, Batangas for medical check-up or, if necessary, confinement and treat­ment.  The Buenafe Clinic has complete facilities,
services and supplies necessary for the purpose and our client has made
arrangement with Dr. Pablo A. Buenafe, director of the said clinic, for the
medical examina­tion and/or confinement and treat­ment of Tomas Perez.'</p>

<blockquote>"The petitioner company assails the
failure of the respondent Commission to take any action on its request.  It would have the respondent Commission
issue an order to en­able the respondent claimant to receive the medical,
surgical and hospital services and supplies which the petitioner company was
offering to furnish through the facilities of the Buenafe Clinic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We do not find for the petitioner company.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The law in point is
Section 13 of </span>the Workmen's Compensation Act, which part­ly provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Sec. 13.  Services,
appliances and supplies - Immediately after an employee has suffered an injury
or contracted sick­ness and during the subsequent period of disability, the
employer or insurance carrier shall provide the employee with such services,
appliances and supplies as the nature of his disability and the process of his
recovery may require, and that which will promote his early restoration to the
maximum level of his physical capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>‘In case the employer <span style="">or </span>insurance
carrier cannot furnish the aforementioned services, appliances and supplies
promptly, the injured or sick employee may acquire <span style="">the same at the expense of the employer or insurance carrier.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The case of the respondent claimant falls under the third paragraph
of the above-quoted provision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A reading of our decision in G.R. No. L-19522 shows that the
petitioner company contested the compensability of the respondent claimant's
illness and refused to give the latter medical and hospital ser­vices and
supplies.  Indeed, it was only after our
decision in said case became final and was to be executed that the pe­titioner
company manifested willingness to provide the respondent claimant with the
necessary medical services and supplies.  The petitioner company does not dispute the fact that during the period
between the promulgation of G.R. No. L-19522 on August 31, 1964 and the
rendition of the decision of the hearing officer on October 28, 1960 the
respondent claimant underwent medical treatment.  Under Section 13 aforequoted, he was entitled to the services and
supplies immediately after he con­tracted his sickness and during the
subsequent period of disability, and not from the day the petitioner company
made its offer to give the same on November 18, 1964.  This is a claim for reimbursement of ex­penses for past medical
services and sup­plies already received and consumed and not for future
treatment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the Workmen's Compensation Commission
did not commit the errors assigned in the brief of the petitioner.</p>
