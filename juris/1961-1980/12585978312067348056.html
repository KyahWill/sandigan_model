				<BR><BR><div align=""><o:smarttagtype name="date" namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"></o:smarttagtype><div class="Section1"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 22, 1960 respondent 
<span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dabocol</span> was stabbed 
by his unidentified passengers while driving a taxicab owned and operated by 
petitioner A.D. Santos, Inc., doing business under the name "City Cab." For the 
injuries he sustained <span class="SpellE">Dabocol</span> was hospitalized and 
subsequently, upon a claim duly filed in Regional Office No. 4 of the Department 
of Labor, was awarded compensation in the sum of P2,207.53. Petitioner's motion 
to set aside the award was denied by the Regional Administrator, and from the 
order of denial the matter was appealed to the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission, which rendered a decision of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> on 
September 13, 1961, with slight modifications, to wit: P2,814.17 as 
compensation; provision for necessary medical and hospital services; P211.06 as 
attorney's fees; and P34.00 as costs. A motion to reconsider was filed with the 
Commission en banc, and upon its denial petitioner filed the instant petition 
for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The only ground invoked here, 
which was also invoked below, first in the motion to set aside the original 
award by the Regional Administrator and then in the appeal to the Commission 
itself, is that petitioner was not given the "opportunity to exercise his 
constitutional right to confront and cross-examine respondent's witnesses, and 
present its evidence in support of its defense of no employer-employee 
relationship." Reliance is placed on Rule 21, Section 5 and Rule 22, Section 3 
(of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission), which 
state:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 5. Right to a hearing. 
-Each party in interest shall have the right to appear at any hearing in person 
or by counsel, present such testimony or evidence as may be pertinent and 
material to the controversy, cross-examine the witnesses against him and rebut 
contrary evidence." (Rule 21)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 3. Admissibility of 
evidence. -No evidence shall be taken into account where the adverse party was 
not given an opportunity to object thereto on grounds referring to 
admissibility." (Rule 22)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Dabocol</span> disputes petitioner's allegation that it was denied 
its "day in court" and cites die order of the Regional Administrator of January 
4, 1961, which turned down petitioner's notion to set aside the award of 
compensation. The pertinent recitals in said order, the truth of which is not 
challenged, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"With respect to the first 
ground, <span class="SpellE">uncontrovertible</span> evidences have been submitted 
by the claimant showing that he was a driver of the respondent City Cab, which 
consist of the driver's Identification Card. The City Cab Damage Slips and the 
Affidavit of claimant's co-drivers namely <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Oledan</span> and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Sacdu</span> who are 
still employed as such drivers of the City Cab until the present. To satisfy 
this Office of the existence of employer-employee relationship between the 
claimant and the respondent, the parties were called for conference first on 
September 13, 1960, at which date, however, neither the respondent's 
representative nor counsel appeared, but only the claimant appeared. Claimant 
admitted that he was given P800.00 by the Capital Insurance Company, which is 
the insurance carrier of the respondent, less advances made to him by the 
company. For the purpose of confirming this statement from the respondent, this 
case was again set for conference on September 25, 1960. On this date, however, 
only the representative of Atty. E.S. Samson, counsel for the respondent 
appeared who requested for the postponement of the conference. The last 
conference was set for October 5,1960 at 9:00 A.M. Counsel for respondent 
presented the Release signed by the claimant and the Capital Insurance Company 
and/or A.D. Santos, Inc. (City Cab) showing that the sum of P800.00 was paid to 
the claimant. Unfortunately, this document, which is now in the possession of 
counsel for respondent, was not submitted to this Office. Counsel for respondent 
also requested for the computation of the benefits due the claimant in this 
informal conference. On all these occasions, counsel for respondent, perhaps by 
reason of the array of proofs that the claimant was really a driver of the 
respondent, never reiterated his stand that the claimant was not an employee of 
the respondent. Obviously, the circumstances leading to the preparation and 
release of the award do not jibe with the allegations of counsel in his 
aforesaid Motion. It can even be inferred that the Motion is merely interposed 
for delay." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">From the foregoing it is quite 
clear that petitioner was afforded reasonable opportunity to present evidence in 
its own behalf and prove its claim that respondent was not its employee. On the 
face of it such claim is frivolous, and justifies the conclusion of the Regional 
Administrator that the steps taken by petitioner to have the award reviewed are 
merely for purposes of delay. It is precisely to expedite the disposition of 
compensation cases, without sacrificing due process, that the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission is not bound by technical or formal rules of procedure, 
as provided in Section 2, Rule 7, of the said body. This principle has been 
applied by this Court in a number of cases. What is important here is that 
petitioner appeared by counsel in the conferences called by the Regional Office 
which originally heard respondent's claim, and did not press its defense that 
the latter was not in its employ or otherwise present evidence to disprove such 
claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
