				<H3>REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. MARIA (MARUJA) P. VDA. DE YULO, ET AL., DEFENDANTS, LUIS F. RIVILLA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Republic of the Philippines appeals from an
    order or the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil
    Case No. 49019 dismissing its complaint as against Luis
    F. Rivilla for lack of sufficient cause of action. Said
    complaint was filed to recover from Maria Vda. de Yulo,
    appellee Rivilla and Mariano Pacheco the sum of P16,357.03,
    with interest at 6% per annum, compounded quarterly, and
    attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total indebtedness and costs, alleging that on several occasions in
    1943 "Maria P. Vda. de Yulo, for herself and through defendants Luis F. Rivilla end Mariano Pacheco", obtained several
    loans from the former Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. in the total
    amount of P7,372.94, all with interests at the rate of 6%
    per annum, compounded quarterly, as evidenced by seventeen
    promissory notes executed by them in favor of said bank;
    that as security therefor, Maria Po Vda, de Yulo executed
    in its favor a chattel mortgage on the standing crops
    growing on her hacienda "Maruja" located at the Municipality
    of Isabela, Negros Occidental.
  <p>By virtue of Vesting Order No. P-4, dated January 21,
    1946, the Alien Property Custodian vested in the Government
    of the United States all the property and assets of the Bank
    of Taiwan, Ltd., which, in turn, were transferred to the
    Government of the Republic of the Philippines, pursuant to
    Transfer Agreement dated July 20, 1954, as supplemented by
    Transfer Agreement of June 15, 1957. Among the assets of
    the bank were the loans secured by the chattel mortgage
    mentioned heretofore.</p>
  <p>Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on
    the ground of prescription of the action and insufficiency
    of its allegations to constitute a valid cause of action
    against him.</p>
  <p>After due hearing on the motion, the Court issued
    the appealed order.</p>
  
  <p>A perusal of the promissory notes attached to the
    complaint shows that appellee signed some of them merely
    as agent of Maria P. Vda. de Yulo. In fact, the complaint
    itself, (paragraph two thereof) alleges "that on several
    occasions in 1943, the defendant Maria P. Vda. de Yulo,
    for herself and through defendants Luis F. Rivilla and
    Mariano Pacheco, obtained several loans * * *." That it
    was solely Maria P. Vda. de Yulo who owed the loans is
    further corroborated by the fact that the chattel mortgage
    was signed only by her and was constituted on her exclusive
    property.<strong></strong><br></p><p>Premises considered, the order appealed from is
    affirmed, with costs.</p>
