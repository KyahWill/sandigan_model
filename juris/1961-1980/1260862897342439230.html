				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, dismissing 
the above entitled cases, with costs against the plaintiff and without prejudice 
to the filing of the proper action in the Court of Agrarian Relations. The 
appeal is before us, the only issue for determination therein being that of 
jurisdiction of the lower court over the subject matter of these cases.
<p>The same were begun separately in the Justice of the Peace Court of Bacolor, 
Pampanga, on January 26, 1954. The plaintiff in both is Eriberto del Espiritu, 
whereas the defendant in case L-13135 is Domingo Q. David and the defendant in 
case L-13136 Maximino Torres. The complaints in both cases are for the recovery 
of sums of money allegedly due from each of the defendants, as follows:</p>

<p>The defendants moved to dismiss said complaints, upon the ground, <i>inter 
alia</i>, of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, but the justice of 
the peace court denied the motion. Thereupon, defendants filed their respective 
answers, denying their alleged indebtedness and insisting on said lack of 
jurisdiction. After due trial, or on March 6, 1954, said court rendered separate 
decisions, for the plaintiff and against the defendants, who appealed to the 
Court of First Instance of Pampanga, and filed therein, on March 26, 1954, a 
joint motion to dismiss the two (2) cases for want of jurisdiction over the 
subject matter. Action thereon having been deferred, upon the ground that the 
reason relied upon by the defendants was not indubitable, the latter filed on 
April 21, 1955, their respective answers. Subsequently, the two cases were 
jointly heard and plaintiff introduced her evidence on defendants' alleged 
debts. The evidence for the defense was, in turn, limited to establishing that 
plaintiff's relationship with the defendants was purely that of landlord and 
tenants, which plaintiff eventually admitted. In due course, on August 7, 1957, 
the Court of First Instance rendered the aforementioned decision, upon the 
ground that "the loans or advances granted to each of the herein defendants were 
utilized to meet the expenses of cultivation of their crops" and that, even if 
not granted in connection with the cultivation, planting and harvesting of said 
crops, plaintiff's actions for the recovery thereof are cognizable by the Court 
of Agrarian Relations. Plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court because 
the only issue to be raised therein will be legal.</p>
<p>In her brief, she maintains that the lower court erred in finding itself 
without jurisdiction to hear these cases and in holding that the same are within 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, because the loans 
in question, she says, were not utilized by the defendants to meet the expenses 
of cultivation of their crops; because the Court of Agrarian Relations did not 
exist when these cases were begun in the justice of the peace court of Bacolor; 
and because said defendants had, by their acts, voluntarily submitted themselves 
to the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga.</p>
<p>As regards plaintiff's claim that the amounts lent by her to defendants 
herein were not utilized by them to meet the expenses of cultivation of their 
respective crops, it should be noted that the loans, allegedly made in 1952, 
were subject to the provisions of the Philippine Rice Tenancy Act, as amended, 
section l4 of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once the accounting is made, any amount of money which the landlord have 
advanced to the tenant as expenses of cultivation or <i>for his own private 
use</i>, as well as any amount of grain or agricultural products <i>advance for 
his support and that of his family</i> shall be paid by the tenant out of his 
share except fifteen per centum of same which is hereby exempt from landlord's 
lien * * *." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, the Agricultural Tenancy Act regulates "<i>all</i> loans or advances 
obtained by the tenant from the landholder," <i>not only</i> "in connection with 
the cultivation, planting, harvesting and <i>other incidental expenses</i> for 
the improvement of the crop planted", but, <i>also</i>, all "loans or advances 
for the <i>subsistence of the tenant</i> and his <i>family</i>" (Rep. Act No. 
1199, section 15), and "all cases involving * * * the settlement * * * of 
disputes arising from the relationship of landholder and tenant"—such as those 
occasioned by said loan or advances—are under the "exclusive jurisdiction" of 
the court therein mentioned (section 31), whereas, pursuant to the Act creating 
the Court of Agrarian Relations, the same "shall have * * * exclusive 
jurisdiction over the entire Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide and 
settle all questions, matters, controversies or disputes involving all those 
relationships established by law which determine the varying rights of persons 
in the Cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the parties works 
the land". (Rep. Act No. 1267, section 7.)</p>
<p>In the cases under consideration, it is obvious that the alleged debt of the 
defendants for the purchase of their respective carabaos, is connected with the 
"cultivation, planting, harvesting and other incidental expanses for the 
improvement of the crop planted." Plaintiff's testimony to the effect that 
defendant Torres had resolved his carabao is insufficient to place the loan for 
its purchase beyond the purview of the above mentioned provisions of our tenancy 
lavs, not only because plaintiff's testimony is hearsay, but, also, because said 
alleged sale does not necessarily show that Torres did not intend to use the 
carabao in the land cultivated by him, when he bought said animal. One may buy a 
carabao, use it and then dispose of it. In fact, in a decision of the Court of 
Industrial Relations, dated June 11, 1954, in Case No. 4596-R thereof—brought by 
defendants herein, together with three other persons, against herein petitioner, 
for the liquidation of their harvest as tenants of the latter, which decision is 
already final and executory—it was held that herein defendants "shouldered the 
expenses of cultivation and furnished the labor, <i>work animal</i> and farm 
implements * * * (Exhibit 2).</p>
<p>Similarly, the alleged debt of defendant David for the "repair of his house", 
the "cost of firewood", his "medical care" and the "cost of one cavan of rice", 
as well as the alleged accounts of defendant Torres, for two cavanes of rice and 
4½ cavanes of palay, are obviously, for the "subsistence" of said tenants and 
their respective <i>families</i>, all of which are covered by said sections 15 
and 31 of Republic Act No. 1199, and section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267. 
Consequently, these litigations are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>
<p>It is true that when the present actions were instituted in the justice of 
the peace court on January 26, 1954, the Court of Agrarian Relations did not 
exist as yet. However, these cases wera pending in the Court of First Instance 
when Republic Act No, 1199 was approved on August 30, 1954. Pursuant to our 
decision in Mendoza <i>vs</i>. Manguiat (96 Phil., 309; 51 Off. Gaz., 137), the 
court thereupon lost its jurisdiction over the subject matter of these 
controversies. Said action involved a tenancy case, filed by a landlord against 
his tenant, in the Municipal Court of Lipa City on October 31, 1953, before the 
approval of Republic Act No. 1199. The tenant moved to dismiss the complaint 
upon the ground that the said court had no jurisdiction to hear the case and 
that the same was within the competence of the Court of Industrial Relations. 
The motion having been denied, the tenant brought the matter to the Supreme 
Court to enjoin the Municipal Judge of Lipa City from taking cognizance of the 
case. We granted the writ of prohibition prayed for, upon the ground that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * on August 30, 1954, Republic Act No. 1199 entitled 'An Act to Govern 
the Relations between landholders and Tenants of Agricultural Lands (Leasehold 
and Share Tenancy)' has been approved. This law governs the relations between 
landlord and tenant in all kinds of agricultural lands. It repeals C.A. No. 
454, known as the Rice Share Tenancy Act, and C. A. No. 46l. The provisions of 
the Act are made to apply to all kinds of agricultural lands, whatever may be 
their nature or character, whether rice, sugar, corn or coconut, and as all 
controversies between landlord and tenant are placed within the jurisdiction of 
the Court of Industrial Relations, so any controversy between landlord and 
tenant, or owner and lessee falls under said court's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>"So that at the time of the institution of the tenancy case in the municipal 
court of Lipa City on October 31, 1953, said court, therefore, still had 
jurisdiction to try the case, inasmuch as no law on tenancy had yet been passed 
governing citrus lands; the case was not yet cognizable by the Court of 
Industrial Relations, a court of special jurisdiction. But, <i>upon approval of 
Republic Act No. 1199, the relation between the landowner and the tenant of the 
citrus land fell under the regulatory provisions of the Act; as a consequence, 
the power of the municipal court to try and decide the case was revoked and 
transferred to the Court of Industrial Relations</i>. The jurisdiction that was 
terminated is one over the subject-matter (not like the power in a criminal case 
to try the case by virtue of the fact that the place where the offense committed 
was within the territorial limits of the court's jurisdiction). <i>The said case 
should, therefore, be, as it hereby is dismissed, and the plaintiff therein 
directed to file his action in the Court of Industrial Relations."</i> (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the hearing of these cases, for the reception of evidence, took 
place on October 2, 1956 and January 31, 1957, after the creation of the Court 
of Agrarian Relations by Republic Act No. 1267, approved on June 14, 1955. 
Pursuant to section 7 of said Republic Act No. 1267, as amended by section 5 of 
Republic Act No. 1409, approved on September 9, 1955, "actions pending in the 
Court of Industrial Relations upon the approval of this Act which are within the 
jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, shall be transferred to, and 
the proceedings therein continued in, the latter court". Inasmuch as the present 
cases should have been dismissed by the Court of First Instance, in order that 
the parties could litigate their dispute in the Court of Industrial Relations, 
and should have been ponding in the latter court on September 9, 1955, it 
follows that the Court of Agrarian Relations had exclusive jurisdiction to hear 
and settle said dispute before the rendition of the decision appealed from.</p>
<p>With respect to defendants' alleged voluntary submission to the jurisdiction 
of the court of first instance, which is not a fact, suffice it to say, that 
jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by law and cannot be 
conferred by the will of the parties.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
plaintiff-appellant. It is so ordered.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
