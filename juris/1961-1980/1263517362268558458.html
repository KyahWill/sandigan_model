				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal, taken by the plaintiffs, from a decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
absolving defendant Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Bayle</span> from their
complaint and dismissing the case without costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As heirs of Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>, who died on
October 21, 1952, plaintiffs herein seek to recover from the defendant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the sum of P5,550 allegedly received by
the latter from the deceased, for the purchase for him of a 3.5 hectares <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>, which the defendant did not make; (2) P1,470 a
year from 1952, as damages resulting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and
from her failure to refund said sum of P5,550, despite repeated demands; (3)
P3,756, as attorney's fees; and (4) the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon being summoned, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint, which was denied, where­upon she filed an answer alleging that she
owed the deceased no more than P1,500, pursuant to a deed of conditional sale,
copy of which had been attached to said motion to dismiss, and that plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Fernandez, had taken from her a Dodge pick-up,
valued at P3,500, which, despite repeated demands, they had not returned, and
praying that plaintiffs be ordered to pay P2,000, as damages and attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their reply, plaintiffs denied
that defendant's debt to the deceased was limited to said sum of P1,500, and
alleged that the conditional sale referred to in defendant's answer represents
a transaction en­tirely distinct from that involving the sum of P5,550, which
is the subject-matter of the complaint; that Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span>
Fernan­dez have not received the pick-up mentioned in said answer; and that,
whatever transaction <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Fernandez may have had
with the defendant had nothing to do with plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> or her co-plaintiffs, said <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Fernandez being neither an heir of Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> nor a party herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was set for hearing in the lower court, on <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="11">Novem­ber 20, 1963</st1:date>, January 20 and <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1964</st1:date>, but, despite notices
duly served, neither the defendant nor her counsel appeared on any of said
occasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After waiting for them, in
vain, for 30 minutes, on the date last mentioned, the court proceeded to
receive plaintiffs' evidence, which established the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> died intestate, on <st1:date year="1952" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1952</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being single and having been survived by
neither descendants nor ascen­dants, his heirs are plaintiffs herein, namely,
his brother and sis­ters <span class="SpellE">Dalmacio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>, and the children of their deceased sister,
Cristina <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>, the other plaintiffs here­in, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nila</span>, <span class="SpellE">Melo</span>, Fe Josefina, Emma, <span class="SpellE">Editha</span>,
Jose, <span class="SpellE">Ulpiano</span> and Leon, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Calanno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August
24, 1952, Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> delivered to defendant,
Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Bayle</span> - the widow to a first cou­sin of the
former - the sum of P5,550, for which the defendant signed a receipt, Exhibit
A, in the <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> dialect, stating that said amount
was to be invested in a loan, secured by a mortgage on an agricul­tural land,
although the Spanish translation, Exhibit A-1, submitted by counsel for the
plaintiffs, uses the term "<span class="SpellE">venta</span> con <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro," or conditional sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said delivery took place and the re­ceipt was
signed in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Fernandez, who,
like­wise, affixed his signature thereto, as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite repeated demands made by the
plaintiffs, defendant, who acknowledged re­ceipt of said amount<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
did not refund the same, despite promises to do so, except the sum of P302.50<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, plaintiffs were constrained to engage
the services of counsel, and file the present action, with the obligation to
pay P3,000, as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the lower court rendered its appealed decision
holding that, although the amounts sought to be collected by the plain­tiffs
aggregate P25,173, the case is "below" its jurisdiction, be­cause <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> testified that
said sum of P302.50, <span style="">paid </span>by the
defendant, had been distributed among the plaintiffs, and the latter pray, in
their complaint, that the aforementioned sum of <span style="">P25,173 </span><span style="">be </span>divided among them as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one-fourth (1/4) to <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>; one-fourth (1/4) to <span class="SpellE">Dalmacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>; one-fourth (1/4) to <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>; and the balance of one-fourth (1/4) to the
other plaintiffs, surnamed <span class="SpellE">Calanno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court deduced from these
circumstances "that each and everyone of the plaintiffs have different and
distinct interest over the estate left by Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>"
and - citing <span class="SpellE">Abon</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Pablo<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span> vs. Jose<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> and <span class="SpellE">Argonza</span> vs.
International etc.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>, as well as Republic Act No.
2613 - held that the amount due to each one of the plaintiffs "shall
furnish the jurisdictional test"; that the claim of each is "below
the original jurisdiction of courts of first in­stance"; and that
"the action should have been filed in the cor­responding inferior
Court." Their motion for reconsideration of said decision having been
denied, plaintiffs interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first paragraph of section 88 of Republic Act No. 296, as amended by
Republic Act No. 2613, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 88.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Original
jurisdiction in civil cases.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In
all civil actions, including those men­tioned in Rules fifty-nine and sixty-two
of the Rules of Court, arising in his municipality or city, and not exclusively
cognizable by the Court of First Instance, the justice of the peace and the
judge of a municipal court shall have exclusive original juris­diction where
the value of the subject-matter or amount of the demand does not exceed five
thousand pesos, exclusive of interests and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there are several claims or causes of
action bet­ween the same parties embodied in the same com­plaint, the amount of
the demand shall be the total­ity of the demand in all the causes of action,
irres­pective of whether the causes of action arose out of the same or
different transactions; but where the claims or causes of action joined in a
single com­plaint are separately owned by or due to different parties, each
separate claim shall furnish the ju­risdictional test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
proceedings, the justice of the peace or judge of the municipal court shall
have original jurisdiction, but the said justice or judge may receive evidence
upo<span style="">n </span><span style="">the question of title therein, whatever may be the value of the
property, solely for the purpose of determining the character and extent of
possession and damages for detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
forcible entry pro­ceedings, he may grant preliminary injunctions, in
accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Court, to prevent the defendant
from committing further acts of dispossession against the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Presumably, the lower court felt that the present case falls
within the purview of the second sentence of the foregoing provi­sion, which
makes reference to "<u>several</u> claims or <u>causes of ac­tion</u>
between the same parties embodied in the same complaint," thereby overlooking
the fact that the "distinct <u>interest</u>" of each of the
plaintiffs "over the <u>estate</u> left by Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>,"
is something entirely different from their "<u>cause of action</u>"
against <u>defendant</u> herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs' complaint sets forth only <u>one</u> cause of action, namely,
the right of Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span> to recover the money
admittedly entrusted by him to the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The singleness of that cause of action is not affected by the
circumstance that its enforcement is now sought by his heirs, who, as such,
have merely stepped into his shoes, and are thus his alter egos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of this assertion becomes more
apparent when we bear in mind that the present case could have been brought by
the administrator - had there been one - of the estate of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that several persons would profit by
such case would not have the effect of splitting the cause of action therein
into as many claims or causes of action as there are beneficiaries or heirs of
the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the cases relied upon by the lower court are not
in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that of <span class="SpellE">Abon</span>
vs. Pablo<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>, there were fifty-one (51) plaintiffs, <u>each</u>
one of whom held, as tenant of the defen­dant, a property <u>distinct</u> from
that leased to each of the other plaintiffs, under individual contracts <u>separately</u>
made, with each one of them, by the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alleging that the latter had col­lected, by way of rentals, more than
what was legally demandable from each of them, said plaintiffs filed, with the
Court of First Instance of Manila, a complaint to recover the aforementioned <span style="">excess </span>payments, aggregating
P6,843.67.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of their indivi­dual
claims exceeded P5,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> case<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> involved
several employees or laborers, who, having been dismissed al­legedly without
cause, filed a joint complaint to recover, from their common employer, their
respective separation pays, aggre­<span style="">gating
</span>P5,235, even if the largest single claim was P300.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of International Colleges vs.
Argonza<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> similarly referred to a complaint, filed by several
employees of the International Colleges, for the recovery of salaries due to
them <u>individually</u>, which, altogether, amounted to P14,211.13, although
the highest individual claim did not exceed P1,300.</p>

<p class="BODY">In these three cases, it is clear that the <u>cause of action</u>
of each one of the plaintiffs was distinct, separate and independent from that
of the other plaintiffs, so that the jurisdiction over the subject-matter of
the litigation, insofar as it was dependent upon the amount involved, should be
determined by the sum claimed by <u>each</u> one of the plaintiffs, not by the
aggregate amount of their claims put together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, plaintiffs herein sued, as heirs of the deceased
Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>, to enforce a right of the latter,
thereby setting up no more than <u>one</u> cause of action against the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the sum
total of the judgment prayed for in plaintiffs' complaint, which lies within
the competence of the lower court, not of a municipal or city court, is de­terminative
of the jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant alleges, however, that plaintiffs' appeal has been
filed out of time, because their motion for reconsideration in the lower court
was neither verified nor supported by an affidavit of merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense is manifestly untenable,
inasmuch as said verification and affidavit of merits are not required by
section 2 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court except when the motion for recon­sideration
is based either upon "(f)<span class="SpellE">raud</span>, accident, mistake
or ex­cusable negligence", none of which was the ground relied upon by
plaintiffs herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their motion for
reconsideration was predicated upon the theory that the lower court had
jurisdiction over the sub­ject-matter of the case, for which neither a
verification of the motion nor an affidavit of merits was necessary, because
the facts and the law invoked in support thereof appear on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">It having been established that defendant had received the sum of
P5,550, in trust for Leon <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>, and had not, with
the exception of a partial payment of P302.50 made by her, refunded said amount,
it follows that she should reimburse the difference of P5,247.50, with interest
thereon at the rate of six per centum (6%) per annum, from October 21, 1952,
until fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, considering
that the defendant had no semblance of justifi­cation for said failure to
discharge her aforementioned obligation, thereby compelling the plaintiffs to
litigate, since June 20, 1963, up to the highest court of the land, and to
engage, in connection therewith, the services of counsel, it is Our considered opinion
that she should, also, pay twenty per centum (20%) of the prin­cipal of said
obligation, as and for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby re­versed
and another one shall be entered sentencing the defendant Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Bayle</span> to pay the plaintiffs herein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the sum of P5,247.50, with interest
thereon, at the legal rate, from October 21, 1952, until full payment; (2)
twenty per centum (20%) of said sum of P5,247.50, as attorney's fees; and (3)
the costs.</p>
