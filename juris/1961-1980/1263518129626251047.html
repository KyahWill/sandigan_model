Aurelio, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>, and Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Archeta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jesufin</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdadero</span>,

Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court
finds all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of one murder
defined and penalized under Art. 248, of the Revised Penal Code, with respect
to the killing of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> and another murder,
under the same article of the same Code, with respect to Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>, and hereby sentences:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> to
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> each in the two murders;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>, being a minor, the Court hereby commits this
accused to a Correc­tional Institution, until he shall come of age, when, if
the said institution should find him to have con­ducted himself very well as a
good and law-abiding citizen, he may be released if so recommended ac­cordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This boy should not spend the rest of his
life confined behind bars for having only followed <span style="">his parents whom he owes love and loyalty; this should <span class="SpellE">atenuate</span> or mitigate the gravity of his act.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"All accused are to pay jointly and severally the heirs of the
deceased Jaime and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>, in the amount of
P6,000.00 in each case, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the accused are entitled
to one-half of their preven­tive imprisonment, being detained prisoners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All to pay corresponding proportionate costs of these
proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The victims in this case, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> and his brother Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>,
had filed the application for pasture-lease agree­ment No. 22449, covering a
public land of about 200 hectares, in the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Daga</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Coner</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Apayao</span>, which Rogelio T. Cardenas, the
Acting Officer-in-Charge of the Bureau of Lands, had recommended for
approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> and his wife Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Archeta</span>,
as well as their sons Aurelio and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> and their son-in-law <span class="SpellE">Jesufin</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Peping</span>) <span class="SpellE">Verda­dero</span>, in
turn, held a small parcel of land which the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span>
claim to be within the area covered by their aforementioned appli­cation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that sometime before December 6,
1961, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> had
made a "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>" in said parcel of land, in
view of which, he was, on December 6, 1961, accused of illegal "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>", upon the recommendation of the
aforementioned Rogelio T. Cardenas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Empeños</span>, in turn, filed a complaint against the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span> for the destruction of the corn of the former by
the cows of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ap­parently,
these incidents had induced the <span class="SpellE">Empeños</span> to enclose
the area held by them with a barbed wire fence, which was broken, however, by
the <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> brothers, on June 11 or 12, 1965, in
order that their cows could pass through and go to the place where they were
sche­duled to be branded, on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="6"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">June 13, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On June 12, 1965, at 3 p.m., as
Jaime and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Contreras, Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Balunsat</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> de Leon, Federico <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Catnae</span> were
walking single-file along a trail passing through a hilly place, covered
thickly by tall grass, coming from the corral of said brothers, defendant
Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Archeta</span> stopped them and asked Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> why he had des­troyed said fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto answered that he had done so to let
his cows pass, in going to the branding place the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cecilia then remarked, in a loud voice,
"you are very tough," whereupon Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>
emerged from the west side of the trail and forth­with gave Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> a bolo slash on the left side of the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost at the same time, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> came out of the tall grasses and immediately
swung his bolo at Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>, who, in his
attempt to evade the blow, tripped over a muddy hole and fell down on his
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Aurelio hacked him on
the right side of the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> swung his bolo at Ernesto, whereas Cecilia
clubbed him on the back, and, with a bolo slash, wounded two (2) of his
fingers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Jesufin</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdadero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> appeared from
different directions and swung their respective bolos at Ernesto, whom <span class="SpellE">Jesufin</span> wounded on the upper part of the breast, near the
thorax, and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> on the left leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>
gave Ernesto another bolo slash on the left forearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>
brothers died on the spot, due to hemor­rhage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The defense maintains that the
injuries sustained by both had been inflicted by Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>
single-handedly and acting in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It tried to prove that, as Aurelio was fetching one of his <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, which was tied to a tree, in the afternoon of the
occurrence, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> came and, immediately,
wounded him with a bolo slash, in his left forearm; that, thereupon, he
(Aurelio) drew out his own bolo and swung it at Jaime's head; that Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> then approached and attacked him with his
(Ernesto's) bolo; that he (Aurelio) evaded the bolo slashes given by Ernesto
and reciprocated the same with his (Aurelio's) own bolo, thereby inflicting
several wounds upon Ernesto; and that <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>, his wife Cecilia and their son-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Jesufin</span> <span class="SpellE">Verdadero</span>, were then
working on the concession of one <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>, who was <span class="SpellE">Jesufin's</span> landlord, about two (2) hours' walk from the
scene of the occurrence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> - then below sixteen (16) years of age -
testified that, after taking his meal, on June 12, 1965, he went in search of
one of his <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, which he was unable to locate,
because, at about 3 p.m., Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Taliping</span> came and
invited him to go back to his house; that, on the way thereto, they met Aurelio
<span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>, who was wounded and drenched in blood, and ex­plained
that he had been wounded by Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>; and that,
thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Taliping</span> brought him and Aurelio to their
hut, near which they found the dead bodies of two (2) persons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this connection, it should be
noted that the theory of the defense is based mainly upon the testimony of the
defendants, where­as the version of the prosecution is supported by the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> Contreras and <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> de Leon, who were with the <span class="SpellE">Ami­lagan</span>
brothers at the time of the occurrence and were corroborated by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Taliping</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
analyzing the evidence, His Honor, the Trial Judge, in a carefully written
decision, accepted the version of the prosecution and found that of the defense
unworthy of cre­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
defense maintains that the occurrence was triggered by Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>, who had allegedly attacked Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> and wounded him, on the left arm, with a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Taliping</span>
positively testified, however, that, when he met Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>,
that afternoon, immediately after the occurrence, he did not have any injury in
the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, also, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Taliping</span> testified that, upon being informed by Aurelio <span class="SpellE">Balunsat</span> that there had been some killings in the ranch of
the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span>, he (<span class="SpellE">Taliping</span>)
proceeded thereto im­mediately; that, on the way, he met <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Empeño</span>, whose clothes were stained with blood; that <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> was, moreover, carrying a blood stained bolo;
that, upon being asked to explain his condition, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
replied that he, his father <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>, his mother
Cecilia, his brother Aurelio, and his brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Jesufin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Verdadero</span>, had killed Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>
and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, Aurelio ad­mitted that the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span>
had no possible reason to try to kill him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the other hand, there is ample
evidence to the effect that the defendants harbored ill-feelings towards the <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> brothers, not only because the latter had
succeeded in securing a favorable <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of
their application for a pasture-lease agreement cov­ering an extensive area,
which included the land held and cultivated by the <span class="SpellE">Empeños</span>,
but, also, because the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span> had thrown down
their (<span class="SpellE">Empeños</span>) fence, apart from seeking their
prosecution for illegal "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The theory of the defense is
further weakened by the circumstance that the testimony of the defendants is
inherently incredible, for <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Empeño</span> would have Us believe that he did not even know the
names of the two (2) dead persons he found at the scene of the occurrence and
that he had never seen them before, although they were, in fact, neighbors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Upon the evidence on record, We
are fully satisfied that, enraged at the destruction of their fence by the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span>, the de­fendants herein, armed with bolos, waited
for them, taking cover behind clumps of tall grass surrounding the trail
leading to the hut of the <span class="SpellE">Amilagans</span>, and that, as the
latter passed by that trail, in the afternoon of the occurrence, the <span class="SpellE">Empeños</span>, acting in concert with each other, attacked and
killed the <span class="SpellE">Amilagan</span> brothers in the manner testified
to by the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having thereby acted with treachery, the crime perpetrated by the defen­dants
is that of double murder, committed by a band and with abuse of superior
strength, which are, however, offset by the mitigating circumstance of passion
and obfuscation, justifying the imposition of the penalty prescribed for said
offenses in its medium period, or life imprisonment, which is the penalty meted
out in the deci­sion appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same should, however, be modified insofar as the indemnity is concerned, which
should be increased to P12,000.00 for each of the offenses aforementioned.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With this modification, the
decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby affirmed, therefore, in all
other respects, with costs against the appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
