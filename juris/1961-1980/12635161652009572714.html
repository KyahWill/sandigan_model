respondent Rosales filed an urgent <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
motion alleging therein that the one unit Crane "<st1:city><st1:place>Lorain</st1:place></st1:city>"
and the one unit Rock Crusher, subject of the action, had not been delivered to
him, because of the refusal of petitioner's chief engineer Juan de Castro and
petitioner's acting foreman Julian Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Be prayed for a court order directing a special sheriff to take
immediate possession of the said equipments and to deliver the same to
plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, March 23, 1964; respondent judge ordered a
special sheriff, respondent Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>
Geronimo, to take immediate possession and deliver to plaintiff said equipment
"and to use reasonable force, if necessary, to carry out the instant
order; and the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City or
his deputies are directed to assist the Special Sheriff in the enforcement a
the instant order." Further, the court directed that the Chief of Police
of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City place into custody Juan de Castro
and Julian Salvador immediately and have them brought before the court, to show
cause why they should not be held for contempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consequence of this order, Julian Salvador
was incarcerated and detained from <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of March 23 to <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>
the following morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 31, 1964, acting upon another <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion of respondent Rosales tiled an the same
day, respondent judge appointed respondent <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>
Geronimo and a certain <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City policeman named <span class="SpellE">Soliman</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> special sheriffs
"to take immediate possession of the 125 Metric tons of structural steel
subject matter of the action," and instructed the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Police Department, "in cooperation with the Special Sheriffs x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to place into custody any and
all persons concerned who may, in one way or the other, obstruct and interfere
enforcement of this order, which is merely a compliance with the decision of
the Court based upon a compromise agreement."</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the foregoing order, respondent Rosales, assisted by
Special Sheriff Geronimo, members of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Police Department and Philippine Constabulary soldiers allegedly with the
use of force and violence and intimidation (this was denied by respondents),
was able to secure from petitioner company's <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
compound 125 metric tons of structural steel claimed to be brand-new and valued
at about P150,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date>,
respondent Rosales registered a motion alleging therein that despite his tender
and offer to pay the sum of P21<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> in payment of
the second half of the 125 metric tons of structural steel, subject of the
instant case, petitioner's treasurer refused to accept payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there prayed that an order issue for the
acceptance of the consignation of P21<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> and
directing a special sheriff "to take immediate possession of and to
deliver to the plaintiff the 125 metric tons of structural steel, subject
matter of the instant action.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 29, 1964, on the same day the motion was filed, the court
granted the same, and instructed respondent <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span>
Geronimo "to take immediate possession of and to deliver to plaintiff the
second half of the lot of structural steel consisting of 125 metric tons,
subject matter of the action and mentioned in the compromise agreement,"
and directed <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> de <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>,
General Manager, <span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span> Santos, Chief of the
Stores Department, and Juan <span class="SpellE">de.Castro</span>, Chief
Engineer, all of peti­tioner company, "collectively and individually, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to comply strictly with this
order and to see to it themselves that these 125 metric tons of structural
steel are delivered to the Special Sheriff for delivery to the plaintiff."
The special sheriff and the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Police Department
were there ordered "to place in their custody any and all of those who
may, either directly or indirectly, impede, obstruct or prevent the Special
Sheriff from taking immediate possession of the structural steel in question,
and for the said <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Police Department to bring
the persons they placed in their custody to this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 2, 1964, respondent sheriff made an effort to take
possession of and deliver to respondent Rosales the second half of the lot of
125 metric tons of structural steel, allegedly brand-new, which, according to
petitioner, is valued at P1,800.00 to P2,300.00 per metric ton, or a total of
P225,000.00 to P287,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff
was thwarted due to the refusal of and, physical obstruction made by the
officers and employees of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 3, 1964, petitioner filed an urgent motion declaring
therein that "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]<span class="SpellE">nstead</span>
of taking delivery of structural steel <u>junks</u>" as mentioned in the
compromise agreement, respondent Rosales, assisted by respondent Geronimo and
members of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Police Departments, through the use of force, threats and intimidation,
and over the objection and protest of the agents of petitioner, forcibly took
from petitioner's <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> yard upon the March 31,
1964 order, <u>brand</u>-<u>new</u> structural steel purposely purchased by
petitioner "for use in its maintenance repairs and construction,” and
therefore not included in the compromise agree­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion complained of the orders of March
31 and May 29, 1964 in that members of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
and <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Police Departments used said orders
as instruments of coercion, oppression and harassment in forcing petitioner and
its agents "to part with <u>brand</u> <u>new</u> structural steels not
covered by the Compromise Agreement"; and that, on the basis of these
orders, several agents of petitioner have been committed to jail by the special
sheriff and members of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Police Departments ranging from 14 to 16 hours
per detention without any legal basis and in violation of Article 124 of the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner there
sought: (1) the nullification of the orders of March 31 and May 29, 1964
"insofar as the officers named therein are authorized to place into
custody any and all persons who may, either directly or indirectly impede,
obstruct or prevent them from taking possession of structural steel so that
such persons may be properly cited for contempt and given a chance to be 'heard
by this Hon. Court on their refusal to submit to said officers"; (2) a
restraining order enjoining plaintiff and the special sheriff from taking
possession of any structural steel belonging to petitioner; (3) return of the
structural steel taken from the company's <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
compound; and (4) for plaintiff to desist from taking possession of brand-new
structural steel not covered by the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was set for hearing on June 5
following.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1964</st1:date>,
respondents Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Geronirno</span> tried to take
delivery at petitioner's <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
compound of the second half consisting of 125 metric tons of structural steel,
subject of the order of May 29.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Government Corporate Counsel Tomas <span class="SpellE">Matic</span>, Jr.
and Attorney <span class="SpellE">Heroico</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Aguiluz</span>
of the Office of the Govern­ment Corporate <span class="GramE">Counsel,</span>
then and there intervened and blocked delivery.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the next day, <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="6">June 5,
 1964</st1:date> - without hearing, obviously because of a misunderstanding
between petitioner's counsel and the judge as to the date thereof<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent judge issued an order, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The decision rendered in this case having become final and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">executory</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
the portion of the Urgent Motion filed by the defendants praying for a
restraining order is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court hereby instructs the Special Sheriff appointed by the
court to enforce strictly the order of the Court dated <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, June 5, 1964, promptly after learning that
petitioner's motion of June 3 was, on that day, denied, respondent Geronimo
served copies of the June 5 order on petitioner and counsel and proceeded to
petitioner's <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> compound to take immediate
possession and deliver to plaintiff "the structural steel" mentioned
in the order of May 29, He was then accompanied by one Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Aguilar and two PC rangers, all in uniform, and by respondent Rosales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attorneys Tomas <span class="SpellE">Matic</span>,
Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Hereico</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Aguiluz</span>
of petitioner stood on the structural steel and prevented the officers from
loading them in the trucks of plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last two claim that the structural steel the officers of the law
were attempting to take were brand-new, not the junks covered by the compromise
agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">A hearing was nevertheless had on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1964</st1:date> on petitioner's motion of June 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge there declared that there
was nothing to be heard since that motion had already been denied; that because
the judgment was based on a compromise agreement, said court had no more <span class="GramE">jurisdiction</span> to entertain said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of representations of petitioner's counsel that respondent special Sheriff
executed the decision in excess of his authority for insisting in taking
brand-new structural steel, instead of structural steel junks as specified in
the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
respondent judge ordered petitioner to file a new motion and to serve copy
thereof on respondent Rosales on Monday, June 8, setting the hearing of said
motion on Wednesday, June 10.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner did file another urgent motion on June 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion prayed for <span class="GramE">a
reconsideration</span>, of the June 5 order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It reiterated the prayer that the' special sheriff be directed to desist
from taking possession of brand-new structural steel and to limit execution of
the judgment to taking structural steel junks as specified in the compromise
agree­ment, and to return the brand-new structural steel already taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It challenged the orders f March 31 and May
29, 1964 as illegal and arbitrary because they authorized the taking into
custody of persons who obstruct the enforcement of said orders, and because
upon those orders respondent Rosales sought delivery of brand-new structural
steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It averred that said orders were
being used as instruments of harassment in the hands of <span class="GramE">respondents</span>
special sheriff Geronimo and Rosales, and violate personal liberties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hearing was held on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for
respondent Rosales objected to the presentation of evidence "[x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to substantiate - the
allegation of the Petitioner that the structural steel subject matter of the
Compromise Agreement (Annex ‘B’ of the Petition) is not 'junk' as termed in the
said Compromise Agreement, but 'brand new '] on the ground that such evidence
is superfluous and immaterial and that petitioner is, <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
to present such evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
'Respondent judge did not allow petitioner to present evidence in support of
the motion, ruled that he no longer had jurisdiction to entertain the same, considered
the incident in question as submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1964</st1:date>,
without awaiting the resolution of the respondent judge, petitioner came to
this Court on certiorari, prohibition and mandamus, with a prayer for a writ of
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner here
charges grave abuse of discretion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
in the issuance of the orders of March 23, March 31 and May 29, 1964, all of
which authorize the taking into custody of persons who obstruct or interfere
with the enforcement thereof, and in summarily denying petitioner's June 3,
1964 urgent motion; (2) in respondent judge's refusal to allow petitioner to
present evidence in support of its allegation that respondent special sheriff <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> Geronimo was enforcing the order in a despotic,
arbitrary and illegal manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
also charges respondents Rosales and Geronimo with having attempted on <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1964</st1:date> to take possession of
another batch of 125 metric tons of brand-new structural steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Averment is made that should these
respondents succeed in taking possession of said structural steel and in the
event of the disposal thereof, it would be impossible for petitioner to recover
these materials later on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
prays:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) that the March 23, March 31,
May 29 and June 5, 1964 orders be annulled; (2) that petitioner be allowed to
present, evidence on its June 5 and 8 motions; (3) that respondent Rosales be
ordered to return the structural steel taken by him in pursuance of the order
of March 31; and (4) that a writ of preliminary injunction issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, on June 13, 1964, first issued a temporary
restraining order effective immediately up to June 25, 1964, upon petitioner's
filing of a P25,000.00-bond "to prevent respondents Sebastian Rosales and <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> Geronimo, their agents, and any other peace officer
acting under orders of the respondent court from further taking any structural
steel from petitioner's premises." The bond was accordingly posted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing on the petitioner's prayer for
preliminary injunction, this Court, on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="7">July
 2, 1964</st1:date>, resolved to grant the same upon a new P25<span class="GramE">,000</span>-bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such bond
having been filed, the writ was issued on July, 3, 1964 enjoining respondents
"from, further taking any structural steel from herein petitioner's
premises and from selling or otherwise disposing of the brand new structural
steel taken by Rosales from the premises of the petitioner on March 31, April
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 10, 1964.”</p>

<blockquote>1. Respondents would want to have the present petition
overturned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their ground is that with
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the resolution of the court below on
petitioner's motion of <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1964</st1:date>,
the petition is premature.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would be a sufficient answer to this argument to say that to
seek redress in the lower court would appear to be futile.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the one hand, there is the persistent effort on the part of
respondent Rosales to procure delivery of brand-new - not junk - structural
steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He succeeded in getting the first
half consisting of 125 metric tons which petitioner vehemently claims were not
junk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in a hurry to take
possession of the rest - but insisted in brand-new structural steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted to confront petitioner with a full <u>fait</u>
<u>accompli</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even as the
motion of June 3 - praying that Rosales "be directed to desist from taking
possession of <u>brand</u> <u>new</u> structural steel" - was still
pending resolution of the court, Rosales attempted to procure delivery of the
remainder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only the adamant
attitude of petitioner's agents that prevented respondent from taking delivery
of what petitioner claims to be new - not structural steel junks, which
precisely were ordered delivered in the final decision of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be gainsaid that with the
authority given respondent sheriff to summon the aid of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City and the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Police Departments and the
Constabulary, and the fact that a number of employees of petitioner have
already been jailed because of their refusal to obey the orders of March 23 and
31, 1964, possession might be effected pending resolution by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, nothing in the record suggests that
respondent judge had issued a formal directive to the sheriff enjoining the
latter from enforcing the orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then, there is the fact that the court below has closed all
avenues for petitioner to prove that what respondent Rosales already obtained
and what he sought to be delivered to him was new structural steel and not
structural steel junks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The great
difference in value between the two classes is reason enough for petitioner's agents
to block enforcement of the orders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Efforts on petitioner's part to procure from the court a hearing on what
should be the quality of the structural steel to be delivered to respondent
Rosales have been in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
petitioner's motions of June 3 and June 8, said petitioner made it abundantly
clear to the court that there is a question of fact not appearing on the
record, involved in the case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether
the structural steel taken and sought to be taken under the judgment was
brand-new or junk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But concededly
'respondent judge did not give petitioner opportunity to present its evidence
in support of this allegation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, respondent judge in his, answer to the petition before this
Court stated that on June 5, 1964, when petitioner's counsel personally went to
see respondent judge, the latter made no promise to counsel to receive evidence
on the motion of June 3, 1964, and added that "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]t
is inconceivable that herein respondent Judge would verbally agree to receive
evidence on a motion which has previously been denied" in his order of the
same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this factual backdrop, the instant petition cannot be labeled
as premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given the inflexible
posture of respondent judge in refusing to receive evidence, and the submission
for resolution of petitioner's last motion without the hearing it considered
indispensable in the determination thereof, petitioner cannot certainly be
blamed for believing in "the futility of waiting for another order."
Couple this with the fear entertained by petitioner that it would suffer grave
and irreparable injury because of the great probability that pending
resolution, delivery of brand-new structural steel may be <u>forced</u> upon it
before the respondent judge could act on the motion, and the picture is
complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was right in
seeking redress from this Court, when it did.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it would not be in keeping with our sense of justice
if this case were to be remanded to the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, "to give it opportunity to decide

<blockquote>2. Petitioner's major attack is <span class="SpellE">levelled</span>
on the lower court's refusal to hear evidence on whether the first unit of 125
metric tons of structural steel allegedly forcibly taken from petitioner was
brand-new or junk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we look in
retrospect at the facts, we find that both in respondent Rosales' complaint
below and in the compromise agreement approved by the court in its, decision,
what petitioner sold to said respondent was a "lot of structural steel
junks" - not brand-new structural steel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parties and courts are bound by the description of the property sold -
structural steel junks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed, the
decision calls for the delivery of structural steel junks, the subject matter
of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is the insistence on respondent
Rosales' part to take delivery of the remaining 125 metric tons of brand-new,
structural steel, which is bitterly opposed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To determine whether or not the structural
steel taken and that respondent Rosales wanted to take are new, or junk as
decreed in the judgment of the court, evidence must necessarily be
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the court determines the
merits of the respective contentions of the parties' upon the proof so
presented.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The necessity of evidence becomes more apparent when we take
stock of the wording of the orders of March 31 and May 29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the judgment speaks of "structural
steel junks subject matter of the above-entitled case," the order of March
31, 1964 directs immediate possession of the 125 metric tons of structural
steel, subject matter of the action, and that of May 29, 1964 commands
immediate possession of and delivery to plaintiff of "the second of the
lot of structural steel consisting of 125 metric tons, subject matter of the
action and mentioned in the compromise agreement." To be noted in the two
orders is that nothing in either directs the sheriff and the other peace
officers specifically to take delivery and deliver possession to respondent Rosales
of structural steel <u>junks</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
officers are naturally in a quandary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the orders do not speak of junks, it is not unnatural that they
should insist on brand-new structural steel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the opposition of
petitioner's agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the final judgment below does not license the court issue an
order for the delivery of structural steel without mentioning therein that such
steel is junk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accurate reading of
the decision will not permit the delivery of brand-new structural steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, the orders of March 31 and May 29
imply a wide area of judgment for the sheriff to exercise; they give him the
impermissible liberty to take any kind of steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By those orders, the court crosses the
authority granted in the decision and treads on prohibited grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, no allowable area of court's discretion
is granted by the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mischief
that stems from the unfettered exercise granted the sheriff in those orders
cannot he minimized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For then,
petitioner's right to deliver structural steel junk would be a nullity; and
they would leave the decision to be satisfied only in the discretion of the
buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To approve of those orders which
give respondents Rosales and the sheriff leeway in taking new for junk would be
to wink at a subtle form of wrongdoing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances, the necessity of taking evidence becomes
imperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No amount of judicial
legerdemain would bring about a conclusion that those orders may be enforced
without clarification, without direct instruction to the sheriff and his aides
as to what kind of structural steel they should take away from petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule that refusal to admit evidence on the quality of
structural steel taken and sought to be taken under the judgment is a grave
abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And certiorari will
lie.</p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner assails as
illegal and arbitrary the orders of the respondent judge of March 23, March 31,
and <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date> insofar as
they allegedly in effect allow punishment and detention of employ­ees of

<p class="BODY">Little need be said about the orders of March 23 and March
31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That certain employees of petitioner
have been detained, for their refusal to comply with those two orders is now of
no consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those events have
already happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remedy for the
aggrieved parties is not here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing

these two orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this respect, those

<p class="BODY">But the <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date>
order stands on a different footing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This order has reference to the second half of the lot of structural
steel (without mentioning whether they are new or junk) consisting of 125
metric tons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order of May 29
carries a directive to respondent special sheriff and the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>

<p class="BODY">The problem posited by petitioner is whether respondent judge has
authority to make this particular order of <st1:date year="1964" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1964</st1:date> upon the precept contained in Section 3, Rule

<p class="BODY">Respondents travel on the issue that the last portion of Section
3, Rule 71, just cited, grants authority to the court to order the arrest of
and to hold in custody any person who disobeys the court's order pending
contempt proceedings against such person "even before he found guilty of
contempt."</p>

<p class="BODY">Contempt proceedings are commonly treated as criminal in nature

no particular <u>accused</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really,
the court is not in a position to know at the time of issuing the orders what

exacts that a person be heard before he is condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The past experience of those employees of
petitioner who have been jailed should have deterred the lower court from
taking such a drastic action as placing in custody those who would not deliver
the structural steel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is
especially so in this case where, on pain of being taken into custody,
petitioner's employees could be coerced into delivering what is called for in

<p class="BODY">Instructive in this respect is <span class="SpellE"><u>Esparagoza</u></span>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Tan</u>, 94 Phil, 749, 753.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent facts of the case are as follows: Petitioners therein,
upon an <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> petition for contempt,
were ordered to appeal and show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why they should
not be punished for contempt for disobeying a court order allegedly directing
them to pay the sum of P595.41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
the petitioners requested the court that said order be held in abeyance until
after they shall have been served with copy of the petition for contempt as
required by the Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking it as a
sign of defiance, the lower court, instead of acceding to such request, ordered
the arrest of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
certiorari, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 3, Rule 64 [now Section 3, Rule 71] of the Rules of
Court provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'SEC. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Contempt</u> <u>punished</u>
<u>after</u> <u>charge</u> <u>and</u> <u>hearing</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- After charge in writing has been filed, and

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘(b) Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order
judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or judge;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'But nothing in this section shall be so
construed as to prevent the court from issuing process to bring the accused
party into court, or froth holding him in custody pending such proceedings.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>As may be seen, a contempt proceeding as a rule is initiated by
filing a charge in writing with the court, and after the charge is filed, an
opportunity should be given the accused to be heard, by himself o counsel,
before action could be taken against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, it is true, a written charge was filed against petitioners, but no
copy thereof has been served on them, nor have they been given an opportunity
to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners asked for
this opportunity, but it was denied them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, their arrest was immediately ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that, Under the same rule,
'nothing * * * shall be so construed as to prevent the court from issuing
process to bring the accused party into court, or from holding him in custody
pending such proceedings', but such drastic step can only be taken if good
reasons exist justifying it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
this reason does not exist, Petitioners not having received copy, of the
written charge, they asked that they be given one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also asked that they be given an
opportunity to answer said charge before action is taken against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both pleas were disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action, in our opinion, is tantamount to
a denial of due process, which may be considered as a grave abuse of dis­cretion,
As this court has aptly said: 'Courts should be slow in jailing people for
non-compliance - with their orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
in cases of, clear and contumacious refusal to obey should the power be
exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
misunderstanding of the terms of the order or of the procedural rules should
not immediately cause the institution of contempt proceedings.' (<span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, 91 Phil.
270)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We hold that good reasons are wanting in the drastic measure
adopted in the order of May 29, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, good reasons exist why the May 29, 1964 order should be
blocked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, if it were true that
respondents Rosales and Geronimo, using said order as their license, had taken
and attempted to take brand-new structural steel, upon a directive not
contemplated by the judgment, then petitioner and its agents have every right
to disregard the same order to protect petitioner's property rights.</p>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention that
respondent judge had lost jurisdiction over the case is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, there is a judgment which is final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this
does not mean that the court has lost any and all power regarding the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the finality of the judgment,
what the lower court lost is its jurisdiction to amend, modify, or alter the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It, however, retains its
jurisdiction to enforce, said judgment "even after the judgment has become

Petitioner's June 3 motion does not seek to amend, alter or modify the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely asks for the lower
court's assistance because its officers, the special sheriff and other law
enforcing agencies, have been enforcing the judgment in a way not in accord
with its terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And certainly, the court
possesses the power [t]o control, in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its
ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a

Thus, it has been commented:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To deprive a court of power to execute its judgments is to
impair its jurisdiction, and the general rule is that every court having

to enforce it, <u>and</u> <u>to</u> <u>exercise</u> <u>equitable</u> <u>control</u>
<u>over</u> <u>such</u> <u>enforcement</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court has authority to inquire whether its judgment has been
executed, and will remove obstructions to the enforcement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such authority extends not only to such orders
and such writs as may be necessary to carry the judgment into effect and render
it binding and operative, but also <u>to</u> <u>such</u> <u>orders</u> <u>as</u>

<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>judgment</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
a judgment is sought to be perverted and made the medium of consummating a
wrong, the court on proper application can prevent it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, upon enforcement of the judgment,
money collected <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> is also under the general
superin­tending power of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
