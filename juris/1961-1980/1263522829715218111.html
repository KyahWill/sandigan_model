<p> "SO ORDERED." </p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, this appeal by the Municipality of Virac. </p> <p> The decision appealed from declared said ordinances illegal upon the ground that they provide for an increase in taxes by more than 50% without the approval of the Secretary of Finance and that they impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax, as well as over forest products. </p> <p> We are unable to share this view.&nbsp; To begin with, the provision of Commonwealth Act No. 472 requiring the prior approval of the Secretary of Finance, when an ordinance increases by more than 50% municipal taxes prescribed in previous ordinances, has been impliedly repealed by Republic Act No. 2264, which vests in municipal, city and municipal district councils ample discretion to impose taxes and even municipal license taxes, and, instead of demanding said <em>prior approval</em> of the Secretary of Finance to ordinances increasing taxes by more than 50% of the previous rates, vests in said official no more than the authority to <em>suspend</em> the effectivity of any ordinance, within 120 days after its passage, when, in his opinion, the taxes imposed are "unjust, excessive, oppressive or confiscatory." </p> <p> Moreover, the ordinances in question do not tax specific goods.&nbsp; They impose license taxes, or regulate and tax those engaging in the businesses or occupations, or exercising the privileges, therein enumerated.&nbsp; They categorize said businesses, occupations or privileges on the basis of the nature thereof - such as "merchants, sari-sari store owners, wholesale and retail dealers of general mechandise," manufacturers of hollow-blocks or similar products, lumber yards, etc. - or of the products they handle - such as pharmaceutical products, rice and corn, abaca and copra, furniture, rattan and nipa shingles, liquor or tobacco.&nbsp; Some of these categories are subclassified, depending upon whether the business or occupation being taxed is undertaken with or without machineries, or whether the lumber yard is merely for deposit, or without a "yard" properly, "but with space to keep already sawed lumber and with office to accept orders for lumber." </p> <p> Secondly, the license tax prescribed in each category is graduated, the amount thereof being dependent upon the "capital investment or purchases for the previous year, whichever is higher." </p> <p> The power to impose such license taxes is explicitly authorized in Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 2264, which provides that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "SEC. 2.&nbsp; <em>Taxation</em>.&nbsp; - Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all chartered cities, municipalities and municipal districts shall have authority to impose municipal license taxes or fees upon persons engaged in any occupation or business or exercising privileges in chartered cities, municipalities or municipal districts by requiring them to secure licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or city council of the city, the municipal council of the municipality, or the municipal district council of the municipal district; to collect fees and charges for service rendered by the city, municipality or municipal district; to regulate and impose reasonable fees for services rendered in connection with any business, profession or occupation being conducted within the city, municipality or municipal district and otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform taxes, licenses or fees:&nbsp; <em>Provided</em>, That municipalities and municipal districts shall, in no case, impose any percentage tax on sales or other taxes in any form based thereon nor impose taxes on articles subject to specific tax, except gasoline, under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code:&nbsp; <em>Provided</em>, <em>however</em>, That no city, municipality or municipal district may levy or impose any of the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; Residence tax; &nbsp; <p> (b)&nbsp; Documentary stamp tax;&nbsp; </p><p> (c)&nbsp; Taxes on the business of persons engaged in the printing and publication of any newspaper, magazine, review or bulletin appearing at regular intervals and having fixed prices for subscription and sale, and which is not published primarily for the purpose of publishing advertisements; </p>(d)&nbsp; Taxes on persons operating waterworks, irrigation and other public utilities except electric light, heat and power; &nbsp; <p> (e)&nbsp; Taxes on forest products and forest concessions; </p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes on estates, inheritances, gifts, legacies, and other acquisitions <em>mortis causa</em>; &nbsp; <p> &nbsp;(g) Taxes on income of any kind whatsoever; </p>(h)&nbsp; Taxes or fees for the registration of motor vehicles and for the issuance of all kinds of licenses or permits for the driving thereof; &nbsp; <p> (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; Customs duties registration, wharfage on wharves owned by the national government, tonnage, and all other kinds of customs fees, charges and dues; </p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes of any kind on banks, insurance companies, and persons paying franchise tax; &nbsp; <p> (k)&nbsp; Taxes on premiums paid by owners of property who obtain insurance directly with foreign insurance companies; and </p>(l)&nbsp; Taxes, fees or levies, of any kind, which in effect impose a burden on exports of Philippine finished, manufactured or processed products and products of Philippine cottage industries. </blockquote><p> "A tax ordinance shall go into effect on the fifteenth day after its passage, unless the ordinance shall provide otherwise:&nbsp; <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary of Finance shall have authority to suspend the effectivity of any ordinance within one hundred and twenty days after its passage, if, in his opinion, the tax or fee therein levied or imposed is unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory, and when the said secretary exercises this authority the effectivity of such ordinance shall be suspended.</p><p>"In such event the municipal board or city council in the case of cities and the municipal council or municipal district council in the case of municipalities and municipal districts may appeal the decision of the Secretary of Finance to the court during the pendency of which case the tax levied shall be considered as paid under protest." </p> </blockquote> <p> It should be noted that, under the penultimate paragraph of the foregoing section, the power of the Secretary of Finance is limited to <em>suspending</em> ordinances imposing taxes that he considers "unjust, excessive, oppressive or confiscatory," and that the <em>only</em>&nbsp; qualification of that power is that it be exercised within 120 days after the passage of the ordinance.&nbsp; What is more, his action may be <em>appealed</em>&nbsp; to the courts of justice, unlike the power of approval or disapproval given to said official under Section 4 of Com. Act No. 472, reading:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "SEC. 4.&nbsp; The approval of the Secretary of Finance shall be secured: </p><blockquote><p> (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever the rates of municipal license taxes fixed or imposed by ordinance of the municipal council or municipal district council by virtue of the provisions of this Act exceed the rates of fixed internal revenue privilege taxes regularly imposed by the National Government upon the same businesses or occupation, except on hotels, restaurants, cafes, refreshment parlors, race tracks, and retail dealers in vino liquors and fermented liquors, and any tax or fee on livery stables, garages, and other places or establishments where public vehicles and other conveyances are kept for hire; </p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever the rate of fixed municipal license taxes on businesses not excepted in this Act or otherwise covered by the preceding paragraph and subject to the fixed annual tax imposed in section one hundred eighty-two of the National Internal Revenue Law, is in excess of fifty pesos <em>per annum</em>; and &nbsp; <p> "(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever the municipal license tax on any business, occupation, or privilege the rate of which is not limited above is increased by more than fifty <em>per centum</em>.&nbsp; </p></blockquote> </blockquote> <p align="center"> "x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x" </p> <p> Considering that the purpose of Rep. Act No. 2264 is to grant more autonomy to our local governments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; and that the object of section 2 thereof is identical to that of Com. Act No. 472, We are satisfied that the provisions of the latter - relied upon by plaintiffs-appellees herein and applied by the lower court - have been repealed by the Local Autonomy Act (Rep. Act No. 2264).&nbsp; And this is borne out by the statements made on the floor of the House of Representatives, during the consideration of the Bill which later became R.A. No. 2264.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "MR. YANCHA:&nbsp; But is not the gentleman aware of the fact that the taxes being imposed under this proposed measure are practically the same taxes that are now being imposed by the municipal council? </p>"MR. ZOSA:&nbsp; Now, gentleman from Samar, they are not.&nbsp; Under Commonwealth Act 472, these are not the same takes.&nbsp; The power of the municipality to tax under the present law is <em>limited</em>, but <em>this bill removes the limitation</em>, so that under this amendment of the Committee<em> the</em><em>power to tax has become very broad</em>. &nbsp; <p> "MR. YANCHA:&nbsp; If the gentleman from Cebu reads section 3, he will find that there is a limitation to the taxing power of the Municipal Council being proposed in the amendment. </p>"MR. ZOSA:&nbsp; Yes, but if the gentleman reads Commonwealth Act 472, together with that amendment, he will realize that the power of taxation given under this amendment has become very broad. &nbsp; <p> "MR. YANCHA:&nbsp; Precisely, because <em>the purpose of this law is to give more local autonomy</em>&nbsp; if he will not increase their finances, and the only way to increase the finances of municipalities is to broaden a little bit their power of taxation so that they will not be burdening the national government by asking certain things that they cannot do themselves."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Further confirmation of Our view on this point is supplied by Provincial Circular No. 24, of the Secretary of Finance - the officer principally charged with the duty to enforce tax measures, and whose views thereon, although mainly persuasive, carry much weight - dated March 31, 1960, in which, referring to the effect of said R.A. No. 2264 upon his power of approval (or disapproval) under C.A. No. 472, said official said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "<em>In lieu of</em> the power of approval of the rates of municipal taxes in certain instances granted the Secretary of Finance under Sec. 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 472, said official is now authorized to <em>suspend</em> the effectivity of any ordinance within one hundred and twenty days after its passage, if, in his opinion, the tax or fees therein levied or imposed is unjust, excessive, oppressive or confiscatory." </p> </blockquote> <p> Neither is there any merit in the theory that the contested ordinances impose taxes on specific goods, or on forest products, which are excluded by section 2 of R.A. No. 2264 from the general power of taxation therein granted, inasmuch as the rate of taxation imposed in said ordinances is dependent upon the "capital investment or purchases for the previous year" - which, likewise, reflects the "capital investment" - "whichever is higher." It is Our considered view that the nature of the business or occupation taxed, and the amount invested therein, which is, also, reflected in the "purchases" - not the "sales" - made "for the previous year" are reasonable grounds for the classification made in said ordinances and the graduated taxes imposed therein. </p> <p><strong> WHEREFORE</strong> , the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby reversed, with costs against plaintiffs-appellees herein.&nbsp; It is so ordered. </p> <p><em> Zaldivar, Castro, Fernando, Barredo, Makasiar, Antonio, </em> and<em> Esguerra, JJ., </em>concur.</p> <p> <em>Makalintal, J., </em>is on leave.</p> <p> <em>Teehankee, J., </em>see concurring and dissenting opinion.</p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Ormoc Sugar Co. <em>vs</em>.

No. 2264 that "municipalities … shall, in no case, impose any <em>percentage tax</em> on <em>sales</em> or other <em>taxes</em><em>in any form based thereon</em> x x " and that using <em>purchases</em> rather than <em>sales</em> as the basis for the tax should be taken as a transparent device to go around the statute's limitations, since the <em>purchases</em> made by merchants are obviously for <em>sales</em> purposes in the ordinary course of business. </p> <p> The graduated taxes so imposed, based on the monthly purchases of the merchants and required to be reported within the 10th day of the following month to the municipal treasurer for the imposition of the tax should be held to violate the prohibition against municipalities imposing any <em>percentage tax</em> or any other form of <em>tax based on sales</em>.&nbsp; This would be in consonance with the Court's ruling in <em>Marinduque</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; that "the ordinance in question, while not providing for a percentage tax, but a graduated tax (the progressive tax therein imposed not being <em>calculated</em><em>on a percentage</em> of the sales made by the taxpayer), nevertheless, (it) prescribes a <em>tax based on sales</em>, contrary to the statute (R.A. 2264).&nbsp; It is true that the ordinance purports to base the tax on either 'gross output or sales;' but the <em>only standard</em> provided for measuring the <em>gross output</em> is its <em>peso</em><em>value</em>, as determined from 'true copies of receipts and/or invoices (which are precisely the evidence of sales) that the taxpayer is required to submit to the municipal treasurer (section 3), without deduction being provided for freight insurance, or incidental costs.&nbsp; <em>Directly or</em><em>indirectly</em>, the amount of payable tax under this ordinance is determined by the gross sales of the taxpayer, and violates the explicit prohibition that the municipality must not levy, or impose, 'taxes in any form based on sales.'" </p> <p> I vote, therefore, in partial affirmance of the appealed decision, for declaring the questioned ordinances invalid insofar as they would impose the taxes hereinabove referred to on the basis of the plaintiffs-appellees' "purchases for the previous year" rather than simply on the basis of their capital investment. </p> <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Paragraph g of section 3 of ordinance No. 6, Series of 1965. </p> <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <em>See</em> Marinduque Iron Mines Agents, Inc. <em>vs</em>.
