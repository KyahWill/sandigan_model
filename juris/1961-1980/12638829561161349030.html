<blockquote>During the pre-trial this morn­ing, the parties thru their res­pective
counsels asked for judge­ment on the pleadings, and both of them presented the
decision in Civil <span style="">Case </span>No.
R-10846.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The property under litigation
in the case at bar being the same subject matter in Civil Case No. R-10846 the
defendants in this present case thru their coun­sels manifested to the Court
that the decision in Civil Case No. R-10846 has already become final and that
no appeal was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Going over the
decision of the Court in Civil Case No. R-10846 the defendants in that case and
who are the <span style="">plaintiffs in the case at
bar </span>were awarded the property in question but the dispositive portion of
the said decision inadvertently failed to state that the plaintiffs in that
case should vacate the premises in question in favor of plaintiffs herein and
for which reason the plaintiffs in the case at bar filed this action for
recovery and for the purpose of requiring the de­fendants herein to deliver to
them the portion of the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">As </span>it was extensively
discussed and found out by the Court in Civil Case No. R-10846 that the
property in question belongs to plaintiffs in the case at bar and the
defendants refuse to deliver to them the ownership and possession of the same,
the former ask this Court to compel the latter to deliver to them the
possession of the portion of the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no appeal taken by them and the
decision in Civil Case No. R-10846, (Exhibit-A for plaintiffs and Ex­hibit-1
for defendants) having become final, the preponderance of evidence is in favor
of the here­in plaintiffs who were defendants in Civil Case No. R-10846 and
against the defendants herein who were the plaintiffs in said Civil Case No.

claim on the <span style="">two </span>parcels of land
in question with preponderance of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent portion of the decision in Civil Case No. R-10846 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful review and study of the evidence of both par­ties,
this Court is of the view <span style="">that </span>the
plaintiffs have failed to estab­lish <span style="">their
claims </span>to <span style="">the </span>two <span style="">parcels of land in question with preponde­rance
</span>of evidence <span style="">although the testi­monial
evidence of their </span>witnesses is presented in <span style="">the manner more </span>ela­borately than that of the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be held, however, that said
testimonial evidence is superior <span style="">to </span>and/or
more paramount than that of the defendants considering all the sur­rounding
circumstances of the case and taking into consideration the <span style="">documen­tary evidence in support of the def</span>endants'
testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">is decisive in the determina­tion as to which
party has established its claim or theory with preponderance of evidence is the
documentary exhibits consisting of tax declarations as shown in Exhibits '1' to
'11' and the official tax re­ceipts as shown in Exhibits '12' '12-A' to
'12-W'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These official documents speak
better than the best oral testimony a witness is capable of making."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that in Civil Case No. R-10846 the de­fendants,

question.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the counterclaim of the defendants in Civil Case
No. 10846 was also dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the dismissal of the coun­terclaim
cannot affect the rights of the private res­pondents on the two (2) parcels of
land in question be­cause said counterclaim referred only to the demand for
moral damages, rentals and attorney's fees.</p>

as error failure of the trial court to dismiss Civil Case No. AV-26 for alleged
lack of earnest efforts of the private res­pondents to settle the case
amicably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. AV-26 is a mere
