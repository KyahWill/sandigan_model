the resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the Court of Industrial Relations dated
May 28, 1963 in its Case No. 2658-ULP, entitled Manila Club Employees Union vs.
Manila Club, Inc. et al., dismissing the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">for lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pertinent facts as
found by the trial court are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Manila Club was organized into a corporation on August
23, 1907, and was granted a corporate life of 50 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a non-stock corporation and it derives
its income from the monthly dues of P20.00 from its nine (9) members, from the
sales of whisky, liquor, wine and beer, from the income of its res­taurant, and
from the charges from games.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
date of its organization up to the date when it was to close its busi­ness, the
Manila Club has been known as the Manila Club and Manila Club, Inc., <span style="">and said names were used in the employees'
chits, vouchers and com­munications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
corporate <span style="">life expired on </span>August
19, 1957, but be­fore closing up, it was granted 3 years of extension within
which to wind its affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the
term­ination of its corporate extension, or on August 10, 1960, the Manila Club
was incorporated, and from that date on, it carried its name as the Manila
Club, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When its life term was about
to terminate, all the employees were offered one-half of their monthly salary
for each year of service because they allowed the employees of the old club to
retire after 12 <span style="">years </span>of
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only 13 employees accepted the
offer and 27 or 29 did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who
did not accept the offer were served with notices of temporary employment, and
on August 23, 1960, those who did not accept said offer began sign­ing from
month to month basis of employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
that date, August 23, 1960, the management extended to the complainants
appointments on the month to month basis, because it was not sure of the
definite course of operation of the new Manila Club, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the third month, management did not
extend to the five complainants herein the month to month appointments anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who <span style="">accepted the retirement </span>offer were paid accordingly, and were
employed in the Manila Club, Inc., as new employees."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 10, 1961, the
Acting Prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations, upon charges lodged by
petitioner Union, filed a complaint charging respondents</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> with unfair labor practice under Section
4(a), subsections 1 and 6 in relation to Sections 13 and 14, of Republic Act
875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically the charge was based
upon respondents' refusal to bargain collectively with petitioner and upon the
dismissal </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">complainants (five of
them in all, as named in the complaint) from the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">After
hearing respondents moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner opposed, and resolution on the motion was deferred until
decision on </span>the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12"><span style="">December </span>18, 1962</st1:date>,
the trial Judge, Honorable <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> M. Villanueva,
rendered a decision finding respondents guilty of unfair labor practice in
refusing to bargain collectively with petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December
 28, 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> respondents
filed </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">motion for reconsideration, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"COME NOW respondents, through counsel, and before this
Honorable Court respectfully move for reconsideration of its Decision of <st1:date year="1962" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1962</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Arguments in support of this Motion cannot be submitted today;
they will be sub­mitted within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period of ten (10) days."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The memorandum in support
of the motion was filed on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> - within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="5"><span style="">May 28, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court of Industrial Relations issued a
resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE <span style="">FOREGOING,
</span>We hold that this Court should have dismissed the present action for
lack of jurisdiction of the subject-matter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner appealed to
this Court by certiorari and now avers that the Court of Industrial Relations
in its resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> erred:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) in holding that it had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of
Case No. 2658-ULP; and (2) in not rejecting respondents' motion for
reconsideration, for failure to state any ground or basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue of jurisdiction
depends upon the question of whether or not the Manila Club, Inc. is an entity
or­ganized for profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is upon this
question that the parties have submitted the case for resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defunct Manila Club
and the Manila Club Inc. have the following identical purpose of
incorporation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"to promote social
relations among its members and, to </span>that end, to establish and maintain,
in the City of Manila, one or more club houses having a library, reading room, and
such other appurtenances and belongings as are usual in social clubs and club
houses." By express provision in its articles of incorporation:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It shall be a non-stock <span style="">and non-profit
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any and all monies and
assets thereof shall be devoted exclusively to the furtherance </span><span style="">of its activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No dividends shall be declared, and no profit
excepting as provided by law with respect to dis­tribution of the remaining
assets in the event of dissolu­tion, shall inure to any individual
member." It is a fact that the club has never declared dividends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing should set
the question at rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pe­titioner,
however, makes much of the fact that the club operates a bar and restaurant,
from which it makes some profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bar
and restaurant cater only to club members, and its operation is only incidental
to the promotion of social relations among them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the club makes some profit does not
destroy its non-profit character, in the same manner that a corporation
organized for profit does not lose that character just because of losses
incurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As <span style="">stated in a similar case, a club should
strive, whenever possible, to have a surplus (Coll. of Internal Revenue vs.
Club Filipino Inc. de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, </span>G. <span style="">R. No. L-12719, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case of The Elks Club
vs. The United Laborers and Employees of the Elks Club, L-9747, </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="2"><span style="">Feb. 27,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, is in
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held there that the Elks Club,
which operates a dining room (restaurant), kitchen and bodega for the benefit
and service of the members, is not a business run for profit, and therefore
Republic Act 875, particularly, that portion thereof regarding labor disputes
and unfair labor practice, does not apply to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Court of Industrial
Relations had no jurisdiction over the aforesaid case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even
before the Elks Club case, the same ruling was laid down in many other
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Boy Scouts of the Philip­pines

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner
stresses a statement in respondents' answer to the complaint in the court below
that the Manila Club, Inc. is an entity engaged in the recreation and
restaurant business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is
such a statement, respondents deny that the entity is a profit-making one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The word "business," of course, in
its plain and ordinary mean­ing, refers to activities or affairs where profit
is the purpose or livelihood is the motive (Collector of Internal Re­venue vs.
Club Filipino Inc. de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">But it has </span><span style="">been shown here that the Manila Club, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span>
was not organized for that purpose or motive, but for the promotion of social
relations among its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
articles of incorporation (Exhibit D) are the best evidence of this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the procedural
question raised by petitioner, we find that the motion for reconsideration
filed by respondents on December 28, 1962, and </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">memorandum in
support thereof filed on January 7, 1963, comply substantially with Sections 15
