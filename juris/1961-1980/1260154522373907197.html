				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 26, 1956, Emilio Magnayon, brakefitter in the Caloocan shop of the 
Manila Railroad Company, was examined and found to be suffering from "poor 
vision and athrophy of upper extremities" and being unfit for work he was 
recommended to be retired due to physical disability. Acting upon said 
recommendation, the general manager of the company recommended his retirement 
effective June 1, 1956.
<p>On June 21, 1956, Magnayon filed with the GSIS his application for retirement 
under Republic Act No. 660, with the recommendation far approval of the 
executive officer of the company. This application was approved by the GSIS 
effective as of June 1, 1956. And basing upon this favorable action, he applied 
to the defendant union, of which he was a member, for payment of his retirement 
gratuity under the provision of Article VI, Section 1 (f) of the Union 
Constitution and By-Laws, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<i>f</i>) Ang sino mang kasaping kusang tumiwalag o itiniwalag sa kanyang 
paglilingkod sa MRR Co., na may pabuya o wala man, kailan pa man at siya ay 
nakatutupad sa pagbabayad sa Kapisanan ay dapat pagkalooban ng halagang Isang 
Libong Piso (1,000.00) kailan ma't siya ay mayroong 30 taong tuluyang 
paglilingkod sa Kompanya at hindi naman kukulangin sa 8 taong pagkakasapi sa 
Kapisanan; subali't kung hindi matutugunan ang takdang paglilingkod sa Kompanya 
at pagkakasapi sa Kapisanan ay pagkakalooban naman siya ng halagang Isang Daang 
Piso (P100.00) sa bawat taon ng kanyang pagiging kasapi sa 
Kapisanan."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendant union approved the application for retirement and paid Magnayon the 
sum of P300.00 on June 25, 1956, and to his widow Manuela Mendoza, P500.00 on 
September 26, 1956 as partial payment of his gratuity based on physical 
disability. On the same date (September 26, 1956), Magnayon died, whereupon his 
widow demanded that she be paid the death benefits due her under Article VI, 
Section 1 (a) of the Union Constitution and By-Laws, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) Sa pagkamatay ng Kasaping Nakatupadâ€”Ang tagapagmana ay tatanggap 
ng abuloy sa Kapisanan ng halagang Dalawang Libong Piso 
(P2,000.00);"</p></blockquote>
<p>Benigno Santos, an employee in the mechanical department of the same company, 
was also examined before September 10, 1956 by its medical department and found 
to be suffering from "cancer maxillary region right, error of refraction and 
arcus sinilitis, total both eyes", and as a consequence, he was declared unfit 
for work. On September 10, 1956, his application for retirement was submitted to 
the general manager of the company with a favorable recommendation.</p>
<p>On October 8, 1956, Santos' application for retirement bearing the 
recommendation for approval of said company was received by the GSIS which in 
turn approved the same effective as of September 16, 1956. Thereupon, Santos 
applied for retirement from defendant union, of which he was a member, under the 
same provisions of the constitution and by-laws of the union, and the same 
having been approved, on October 5, 1956, the union paid Santos the amount of 
P1,000.00 as "gratuity granted to a retiree due to physical disability." On 
October 10, 1956, Santos died, whereupon his widow Maria Enriquez demanded 
payment of the balance of Pl,000.00 due her as death benefits under the 
provisions of Article VI, Section 1 (a) of the Union Constitution and By-Laws, 
quoted above.</p>
<p>Because of the failure of defendant union to pay the death benefits which the 
two widows claimed to be entitled to, they commenced the present action before 
the Court of First Instance of Manila against defendant union praying that it be 
ordered, to pay Manuela Mendoza P1,200.00 and Maria Enriquez P1,000.00, or a 
total of P2,200.00 representing the balance of the death benefits due them for 
the death of their husbands, plus interest and attorney's fees. The case having 
been submitted on the basis of the stipulation of facts submitted by the 
parties, the court rendered decision on November 2, 1957 dismissing the 
complaint. Plaintiffs interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>We agree with the lower court that the deceased had already been retired at 
the time of their death and for that reason plaintiffs herein are not entitled 
to the death benefits contemplated in Article VI, Section 1(<i>a</i>) of the 
Constitution and By-Laws of the defendant union. And this is so because from the 
provisions of said constitution and by-laws it is clear that the death benefit 
is intended to be paid to a member of good standing <i>only</i> when he meets 
death <i>while still a member of the union</i>. It does not apply when he dies 
after his retirement. Here it is undisputed that at the time of the death of the 
husbands of appellants which took effect on September 26, 1956 and October 10, 
1956, respectively, they were already deemed retired because their retirement 
became effective on June 1, 1956 and September 16, 1956, respectively. The fact 
that the widows received their official notice of retirement from the GSIS after 
the death of their husbands is of no moment because what determines the date of 
retirement is the date of its approval if the same is made known to the retiree 
even if the official notice thereof comes afterwards. As correctly observed by 
the lower court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * When they therefore applied for retirement from the union and for 
payment of their gratuity, they were already retired from the Company, and their 
retirement from the service was precisely the basis of their application for 
retirement gratuity from the union. The union approved their applications for 
retirement gratuity and paid them the amounts due them under applicable 
provisions of the union constitution and by-laws; therefore, insofar as the 
union is concerned, it had discharged its obligation under its constitution and 
by-laws."</p></blockquote>
<p>If we will follow the theory of appellants we will have a situation wherein 
they will be allowed to get the retirement pay of their husbands on the dates 
when the same becomes effective, and after the occurrence of their death later 
they would also be allowed to get the death benefits accorded to their 
beneficiaries under the constitution and by-laws of the union on the simple 
expedient that the official notification of the approval of their retirement 
only came after their death. We are not prepared to adopt such interpretation 
which is contrary to logic and sound reasoning.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as 
to costs.</p><i>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Paredes,</i> and <i>Dizon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
