				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:     </STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on certiorari of a decision of the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was commenced by respondent <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span>
Pineda, in the Court of Agrarian Relations, to compel the Manila Railroad
Company - now known as the Philippine National Railways or PNR - and one
Mariano Mendoza, to recognize said respondent as tenant with respect to a given
tract of land and to modify the terms and conditions under which he would hold
said property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same is a narrow strip of land, 30 meters in width, located
at San Mateo, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
admittedly belongs to herein petitioner, as part of its right of way for
railroad purposes in that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
petitioner's railroad track runs lengthwise across the middle of said
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to March 1, 1961, when the
present action was begun, said land - excluding the roadbed of the railroad
track, which is from ten (10) to twelve (12) meters in width - had been leased
to four (4) or five (5) persons, one after the other, the last of whom was the
aforementioned Mariano Mendoza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Pineda claims to have been working on said land and devoting the same to the
production of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, for twenty-five (25) years, as
tenant of whoever was the lessee, up to the immediate predecessor of Men­doza,
one Maria <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, on a 55-45 share basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon expiration of the contract of lease
between Maria <span class="SpellE">Ganlas</span> and petitioner herein,
respondent was sued by Mendoza in the Court of Agrarian Rela­tions, because the
former (respondent Pineda) objected to the lat­ter's (Mendoza's) entry into the
land, for the purpose of cultivating the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to an interlocutory order of the CAR, dated June 6, 1960,
respondent remained in possession of the land and planted <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
thereon during the agricultural year 1960-1961.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three (3) months after the institution of that case, petitioner herein
filed, with the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, ag­ainst respondent Pineda, an
action for forcible entry, which was dismissed, upon the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of said court to entertain it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having subsequently learned that Pineda had already caused the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> produced during said agricultural year to be
threshed, soon thereafter, petitioner demanded from him the de­posit of the sum
of P380.00, as rental for the lease of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, respondent deposited said amount
with the local branch of the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, however, or on March 1, 1961, he instituted in that Court
the present action against petitioner herein and Mariano Mendoza, for the
purpose of compelling both to recognize him as the tenant on the litigated land
and of changing the nature of his tenancy, from one of share tenancy to that of
leasehold tenancy, as well as of reducing the amount of the rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 2, 1961, petitioner moved to dismiss
the case for lack of jurisdiction, which was denied by the CAR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, moreover, declared Mendoza in
default for failure to file his answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In due course thereafter, or on September 23, 1961, the CAR rendered a
decision directing that respondent be maintained on the land in question, as
petition­er's agricultural tenant; that the sharing of the produce between them
be changed, from one of share tenancy to that of leasehold tenancy, effective
the crop year 1961-1962; and that the rental for the use and occupation of said
land be fixed at P133.74 annually, beginning from said crop year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision was, on appeal taken by
petitioner herein, affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review on
certiorari, filed by pe­titioner herein, to which We have given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this appeal is whether or not the Court of
Agrarian Relations had authority to hear and decide this case, petitioner's
contention being that said court had no jurisdiction to do so, the land in
question not being an agricultural land within the purview of the Agricultural
Tenancy Act (Republic Act No. 1199) and the Agricultural Land Reform Code
(Republic Act No. 3844), because said petitioner did not acquire and could not
have acquired said land for agricultural purposes, not being authorized either
by its charter or by Executive Order No. 399, series of 1951, other­wise known
as the Uniform Charter for Government Owned and Controlled Corporations, to
engage in agricultural production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
affirming the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, the Court of Appeals
held the opposite view, upon the ground that "with the use to which the
land has been primarily devoted, there can be no doubt that the same falls
within the category of an agri­cultural land contemplated by Republic Act No.
1199," and that "this being the case, any attempt to dispossess the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of his landholding would be a case of
dispossession contemplated under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199 and
therefore falls within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Agrarian Rela­tions."</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue is not a novel one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under substantially identical conditions, We held in Philippine National
Railways vs. V.A. del Valle<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that the Court of Agrarian Relations has no jurisdiction over cases of this
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote from our decision in
that case:</p>

<blockquote>"According to Section 3 of the <u>Agricultural Tenancy</u> <u>Act</u>,
‘[a]<span class="SpellE">gricultural</span> tenancy is the physical possession by
a person of land <u>devoted to agriculture</u> belonging to, or legally
possessed by, another for the purpose of production through the labor of the
former and of the members of his immediate farm household, in consideration of
which the for­mer agrees to share the harvest with the latter, or to pay a
price certain or ascertainable, either in produce or in money, or in both.’<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> The
term 'agricultural land' as understood by the <u>Agricultural Land Reform Code</u>
is not as broad in meaning as it is known in the constitutional sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in­terpreted in <span class="SpellE"><u>Krivenko</u></span>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Register</u> <u>of</u> <u>Deeds</u>, 79 Phil. 461, 471, the
phrase 'agricultural land', constitutionally speaking, includes all lands that
are neither mineral nor timber lands and embraces within its wide sweep not
only lands strictly agri­cultural or devoted to cultivation for agricultural
purposes but also commercial, industrial, resi­dential lands and lands for
other purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, by
Section 166(1) of the <u>Agricultural</u> <u>Land</u> <u>Reform</u> <u>Code</u>,
'"[a]<span class="SpellE">gricultural</span> land" means land <u>devoted</u>
<u>to</u> <u>any</u> growth, including but not limited to crop lands, salt
beds, fish ponds, idle land and abandoned land as defined in paragraphs 18 and
19 of this section, respectively.’<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is obvious then that under the law, the land here in
controversy does not fit into the concept of agricultural land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PNR cannot devote it to agriculture because
by its own charter, Republic Act 4156, PNR cannot engage in agriculture.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, the land - which adjoins the railroad track on both
sides - is part of <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> right of way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That right of way is not limited to the
particular space occupied by the roadbed or its main track.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also includes the portions occupied by the
telephone and telegraph posts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
extends to a width of 30 me­ters which reasonably gives the train locomotive
engineer a clear commanding view of the track and its switches ahead of him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The entire width is important to <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span>
rail­road operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which should not
be hampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, communication lines
must not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buildings should
not be constructed so close to the track.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, it is not so easy to prevent people from walking along the track;
animals, too, may stray into the area; obstructions there could be along the
track itself which might cause derailment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of these could prevent the locomotive engineer from taking the
necessary precautions on time to avert accidents which may cause damage to the
trains, injury to its passengers, and even loss of life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Besides, the use of the strips of land on both sides of the
track in railroad operation is inconsistent with agricultural activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of lease authorizes the railroad
company to enter upon the premises to make repairs, place its materials on the
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may even take soil from the
land to fill up any part of the railroad track destroyed by water during rainy
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What if PNR should de­cide to
construct another parallel track on the land leased?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occupant of the land cannot prevent or
stop PNR from doing any of these.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Security of tenure so important in landlord-tenant relationship may not
thus be attained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foregoing are considerations sufficient enough to deter
us from adopting the view that the disputed land - in narrow strips - is
agricultural land within the meaning of the Agricultural Tenan­cy Act and the
Agricultural Land Reform Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
destination, it is not agricultural."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding no reason to depart from the foregoing view, which We
hereby reiterate, the decision of the Court of Appeals is, ac­cordingly,
reversed, and the present case dismissed, without spe­cial pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
