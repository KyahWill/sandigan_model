Order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, Branch VII, in Criminal Case
No. 10233 of said court, dated August 4, 1965, wherein the forfeited bond of
Central Surety and Insurance Co. in the amount of Sixty Thousand Pesos (P60,000.00)
was reduced to 10% thereof or Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00).</p>

<p class="BODY">The following incidents are not in dispute:</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 10233 of the Court of First Instance of
Iloilo the Central Surety and Insurance Co. filed surety bonds of Five Thousand
Pesos (P5,000.00) for the provisional liberty of each of twelve Muslims who
were charged with unlawful possession of "Union blue-seal"
cigarettes, all in all amounting to Sixty Thousand Pesos.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1964</st1:date>
the case was called for arraignment and trial but all the accused failed to
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the record showed that the
bonding company was duly notified since July 9, 1964, the trial judge in open
court issued an order declaring all the bonds confiscated in favor of the
government, ordering the arrest of the accused, and giving the bonding company
30 days within which to show cause why judgment should not be rendered against
it and to produce the accused before the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Motions were filed by the surety company for the court to lift
its order of confiscation and to grant it an extension of time within which to
produce the bodies of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
motions were denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>,
the Provincial Fiscal Alfonso B. <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, filed a
"Motion to render judgment against the bonds of all the accused." The
bonding company moved to defer consideration of said motion, and the trial
court granted the bonding company up <u>to May 8, 1965</u> to produce all the
accused, otherwise judgment would be rendered against it for the full amount of
the bonds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this order was
received by the bonding company on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4"><u>April
 30, 1965</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the
non-appearance of the accused on the above scheduled date, Judge <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bellosillo</span> who was then
presiding the court, in an Order dated <u>June 8, 1965</u>, rendered judgment
against the Central Surety and Insurance Co., Iloilo branch, for it to pay the
Republic of the Philippines the sum of Sixty Thousand Pesos (P60,000.00)
representing the total amount of the bonds it had filed for the provisional
release of the twelve accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 10, 1965, a writ of execution was issued to satisfy the
above-mentioned judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been
served with copy of the writ, the bonding company through counsel filed a
"Motion for partial remittance" alleging that it had exerted all
efforts possible to bring the accused before the court, spending a lot of money
in the process but which all proved futile, and consequently it had no recourse
but to invoke equity and justice for the court to exercise its discretion in reducing
its liability to <u>five percent</u> of the amount thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was vigorously opposed by the
Provincial Fiscal principally on the grounds that the judgment against the bond
of the surety company was already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and that the accused had never been apprehended and brought before the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After rejoinder and answer to
rejoinder have been respectively filed by the parties, the trial court in an
Order of <u>August 4, 1965</u>, acted favorably on the motion of the surety
company and reduced the liability of the bonding company from <u>Sixty Thousand</u>
to <u>Six Thousand Pesos</u> and ordered the issuance of another writ of
execution for the said amount.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Provincial Fiscal in a motion filed on August 20, 1965, moved
for a reconsideration of the Order of August 4, 1965, stressing that the
judgment on the bond for Sixty Thousand Pesos rendered on July 8, 1965, was
final and could no longer be altered or amended, and on the assumption that
said judgment could still be altered, a partial remittance of said bond is
unjustified inasmuch as the bonding company has not made a partial compliance
of its responsibility and/or liability under the surety bonds filed in favor of
the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion of the
Provincial Fiscal was opposed by the surety company, the latter invoking the
court's inherent discretionary power to execute the bond in full or in part
according to the circumstances of each case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime the surety company paid the sum of Six Thousand Pesos
(P6,000.00) to the government.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration having been denied in an Order of September 3,
1965, the PEOPLE elevated the matter to this Court for review, claiming that
there was grave abuse of discretion committed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
when it reduced the liability of the bonding company, notwithstanding finality
of the court's judgment and non-compliance by the former of its obligation to
produce the twelve accused for arraignment and trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surety-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> asserts however that it
is well-settled in this jurisdiction that the order of confiscation of a bail
bond for failure of the accused to appear "is conditional and
interlocutory'', and that the trial judge herein judiciously upheld the spirit
of liberality towards bondsmen in the matter of reduction of liability on
forfeited bonds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, there is merit to the surety's assertion that in the
application of the provisions of Section 15, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
on <u>forfeiture of bail</u>, this Court has countenanced a liberal attitude of
allowing complete or partial exoneration of the surety's liability even after
judgment had become final and a writ of execution had been issued depending on
the circumstances of each case.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The policy however is premised on the presence of two conditions,
<span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>: 1) that the body of the accused is produced,
and 2) that there is satisfactory explanation for the non-appearance of the
accused when first required by the trial court to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both conditions must concur.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Alamada</span></u>,
1951, this Court pronounced that in the forfeiture of bail bonds, <u>courts are
liberal in accepting the explanation of bondsmen, provided the body of the
defendant is produced</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
reduced the liability of the bondsmen even after final judgment and issuance of
a writ of execution because the two conditions were fulfilled - surrender of
the accused and satisfactory explanation for the latter's non-appearance at the
time he was called to be present in court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the situation before Us the twelve accused were never
surrendered to the trial court thereby leaving the criminal case <span class="SpellE">undisposed</span> to the present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Verily, the surety failed in its obligation clearly defined in Section
2, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Condition
of the bail</u>. - The condition of the bail is that the defendant shall answer
the complaint or information in the court in which it is filed or to which it
may be transferred for trial, and after conviction, if the case is appealed to
the Court of First Instance upon application supported by an undertaking or
bail, that he will surrender himself in execution of such judgment as the
appellate court may render, or that, in case the cause is to be tried anew or
remanded for a new trial, he will appear in the court to which it may be
remanded and submit himself to the orders and processes thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not having complied with the conditions of the bail bonds it
filed for and in behalf of the twelve accused, the surety is not entitled to
exoneration, not even a mitigation of its liability under said bonds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General therefore correctly
asserts that grave error and grave abuse of discretion were committed by the
trial court in the issuance of its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="8">August 4, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>and that of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="9">September <span style="">3, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>denying reconsideration thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Had the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> been mindful of this Court's
decision in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Kasim</span></u>, et al., L - <span style="">12624, </span>May 25, <span style="">1960, </span>We could have been spared this unnecessary litigation and
avoided so much delay in exacting from the bonding company what is due the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Kasim</u></span>
which is invoked by the Solicitor General in his brief, the question presented
was whether or not the trial court had authority to relieve the bonding company
of part of its liability even though the body of its principal had not been
surrendered to the court, and this Tribunal through then Chief Justice Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> explicitly ruled that "(I)t is the bonding
company's responsibility to produce the accused before the court whenever
required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to so produce is <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> a <u>complete breach</u> of the guaranty'',
and that in accordance with Section 15, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court (now
Section 15, Rule 114), if the bonding company fails to produce the body of its
principal, or to give a satisfactory reason for his non-production, a judgment
shall be rendered against it on its bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(underline supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">To paraphrase Justice Enrique M. Fernando in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Vallangca</span></u></span><u><span style="">, </span>et. al. vs. Hon. Crispin G. <span class="SpellE">Ariola</span>, et. al.</u>, the law on this matter is clear and
explicit leaving no room for interpretation and it is the bounden duty of the
courts to apply it as worded.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Vallangca</u></span> there was no
surrender of the person of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court ruled that no error was committed by the lower court in sustaining
the forfeiture of the bail bond of said accused, following its earlier Decision
in <u>People vs. Franklin, accused, Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Co. Inc.,
bondsman-appellant</u>, wherein it was held that a forfeiture of a bail bond is
justified by the failure to produce the accused in court by reason of her
obtaining a Philippine Passport and leaving for the United States.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to this appeal now before Us, not only did Central
Surety &amp; Insurance Co. fail to surrender all the twelve accused but it
likewise failed to offer a satisfactory explanation for their
non-appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that
the only ground invoked by the surety for "partial remittance" of its
liability was "that all possible means have already been diligently
exercised to locate and apprehend said accused but all turned to be futile and
in vain . . . and civilians were hired . . . but without result." (p. 18,
Amended Record on Appeal) Such statements couched in general terms without
adequate proof to substantiate them are inconclusive and unsatisfactory.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The surety was well aware when it filed the bail bonds in question that its
principals were all Muslims, residents of <span class="SpellE">Jolo</span>;
consequently, it should have exercised more than ordinary care and diligence in
keeping close surveillance of the whereabouts of said accused to prevent the
latter from jumping bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, the
surety failed to do and it must suffer the consequences.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, We set aside the orders of the
trial court dated August 4, 1965, and September 3, 1965 respectively, and order
the execution of the bail bonds of Central Surety &amp; Insurance Co. Inc. to
the full amount of Sixty Thousand pesos (P60,000.00), in favor of the Republic
of the Philippines pursuant to the judgment rendered by the trial court on June
8, 1965.</p>
