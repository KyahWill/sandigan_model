				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the election held on November 10, 1959, petitioner Reinerio Ticao was a 
candidate for the position of Vice-Mayor of the City of Iloilo, while his 
co-petitioners were candidates for the office of councilor of the same city. On 
the other hand, respondent Nacianceno Rico was also a candidate for the position 
of Vice-Mayor of, the same city, while his co-respondents—except the respondent 
judge—were candidates for the office of councilor.
<p>On December 12, 1959, the city board of canvassers proclaimed Ticao as 
Vice-Mayor elect, and his co-petitioners as councilors elect.</p>
<p>On the 24th of the same month and year, respondents, except the respondent 
judge—filed an election protest against petitioners. As grounds of protest, they 
alleged, inter alia, the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"5. <i>The City of Iloilo is composed of </i>265<i> election, precincts</i>, 
in which according: to the Iloilo City Board of Canvassers, the 
parties-litigants received the votes reflected in the list appended hereto as 
Annex 'A' and made part hereof by reference;</p>
<p>6. <i>The protestants impugn the elections in all the aforesaid </i>265<i> 
precincts</i> as not free, orderly, nor honest but were characterized by gross 
and rampant frauds, terrorism, coercion, corrupt practices, and other election 
irregularities as herein below specified, so that it was a farcical election, 
the electors haying been prevented from expressing their free choice;</p>

Inspectors were anomalously and illegally changed with followers and supporters, 
of the protestees, thru dubious and questionable manipulations of the protestees 
and/or their leaders;" (p. 3 of the Protest, Annex "B" of the Petition; italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Answering the Protest, petitioners in turn, made, among others, the following 
averments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. * * that the election of 10 November 1959 in the entire City of Iloilo 
was held and conducted in the cleanest most peaceful and honest manner, in 
pursuance and in full implementation of all democratic processes, and that the 
results thereof were indicative of the truest expression of popular will in the 
City of Iloilo which gave an unprecedented plurality of votes to all the 
protestees herein;" (Par. 3, p. 2 of Annex "A" of the Petition)</p>
<p>"2. * * that the elections held in the City of Iloilo on November 10, 1959, 
was conducted in the most peaceful and orderly manner, and its results reflected 
the true and clear will of the electorate of the City of Iloilo; *" (Par. 2, p. 
1, of Annex "A-1" of the Petition)</p>
<p>"2. * * that the elections held in the City of Iloilo on November 10, 1959, 
was conducted in the most peaceful and orderly manner, and its results reflected 
the true and clear will of the electorate of the City of Iloilo; * *" (Par. 2, 
p. 1 of Annex "A-2" of the Petition)</p>
<p align="center">"II.</p>
<p>"* * that the elections held last November 10, 1959 were free, orderly and 
honest, protestee herein, together with his co-protestees having endeavored that 
the questioned election be without any taint of fraud, terrorism, coercion, 
and/or corrupt practices, having fully and heartily agreed and supported the 
petition of Mayor Rodolfo Ganzon that Iloilo City be placed under the control of 
the Commission on Elections to insure the city electorate a free and untramelled 
expression of their right to vote;" (Par. II, p. 1 of Annex "A-3" of the 
Petition)</p>
<p>"* * that the election <i>in all of the </i>265<i> precincts of the City of 
Iloilo</i>, was free, orderly, honest, regular and depicted the true will of the 
electorate, and that, there never was any threat or terrorism employed allegedly 
by the Protestee or any of his group under the Ganzon-Ticao line-up, as so 
emphatically alleged by the Protestants;" (Par. 2, p. 2 of Annex "A-4" of the 
Petition; Italics supplied.)</p>
<p>"* * that the election held <i>in all the </i>265<i> precincts of the City of 
Iloilo</i>, was not a farcical election, but was the free and untram-meled 
expression of the people's choice, devoid of frauds, threats, terrorisms, 
coercions and other illegal and corrupt election practices and irregularities 
which the protestants would have this Honorable Court to believe that the 
protestee or his co-protestees, has or have committed and employed; * * " (Par. 
2, p. 1 of Annex "A-5" of the Petition; Italics supplied)</p>
<p>"* * that the last elections in Iloilo City has been the most orderly, 
peaceful, clean, and honest, depicting the true will of the city electorates;" 
(Par. 4, p. 2 of Annex "A-6" of the Petition)</p>
<p>"* * that if ever there were such frauds, terrorism, coercion, corrupt 
practices, and other election irregularities committed during the last 
elections, the protestants and their leaders and supporters were the ones who 
tried, attempted, and/or perpetrated the same, but they were not able to 
frustrate the electors of the City of Iloilo from expressing their choice for 
protestees;" (Par. 3, p. 1 of Annex "A-7" of the Petition)</p>
<p>"* * that <i>protestants</i> indiscriminately <i>protested</i> against each 
and all the duly elected officials in the City of Iloilo, all of whom belonged 
to the same ticket, and indiscriminately <i>in all the electoral precincts in 
the City of Iloilo.</i>" (Par. 9, p. 4 of Annex "A-7" of the Petition; Italics 
supplied)</p>
<p>"* * that the election <i>in all the </i>265<i> precincts in the City of 
Iloilo</i> was free orderly, honest and regular, and that there was no threat or 
terrorism employed by the protestee and his companions under the Ganzon-Ticao 
ticket as alleged by the Protestants, * *'' (Par. 2, p. 2 of Annex "A-8" of the 
Petition; Italics supplied).</p>
<p>"* * that the elections held last November 10, 1959 which is the subject of 
the protest in the above-entitled case, was most orderly, peaceful, clean, 
honest, free and untramelled, * *" (Par. 2, p. 1 of Annex "A-9" of the 
Petition)</p>
<p>"* * that the elections held in the City of Iloilo on November 10, 1959, 
concerning the herein protestee is honest, free and clean, truly and genuinely 
expressive of the true mandate and popular choice of the electors of the City of 
Iloilo, Philippines, done in an orderly and peaceful manner;" (Par. 2, p. 1 of 
Annex "A-10" of the Petition). Italics supplied.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the course of the hearing held on December 14, 1960, the 
protestants—referred to hereafter as respondents—tried to introduce evidence 
regarding the affiliation of the inspectors of several precincts not included 
among those specifically enumerated in paragraph 9 of the Protest reproduced 
above. The protestees (petitioners herein) objected, but upon verbal motion of 
respondents, the respondent judge allowed them to amend paragraph 9 of their 
Protest by adding fourteen other precincts to those enumerated therein. 
Petitioners' motion for the reconsideration of said order was denied by the 
respondent judge. Thereupon, they filed the present original petition for 
certiorari claiming that, in allowing the amendment already referred to, His 
Honor, acted without jurisdiction because at that time, the period for the 
filing of protest and the introduction of substantial amendments had already 
elapsed.</p>
<p>The issue in this case, therefore, is whether the amendment allowed by the 
respondent judge was substantial in character and constituted an additional 
ground of protest.</p>
<p>It is elementary in matters of election protests that the corresponding 
Protest should be filed within the period provided by law for that purpose 
which, as far as the present case is concerned, is two weeks after the date of 
proclamation. As a corollary, it has been consistently iieid that;substantial 
amendments to the Protest may be allowed only within the same period (Valenzuela 
vs. Carlos et al., 42 Phil. 428; Orencia vs. Araneta, 47 Phil. 830). Stated 
otherwise, the rule in an election protest is that the protestant or counter 
protestant must stand or fall upon the issues he had raised in hjs original or 
amended pleading filed prior to the lapse of the statutory period for tine 
filing of protest or counter protest.</p>
<p>In determining whether the amendment now complained of violates the foregoing 
rule, it is important to bear in mind that the Protest filed by respondents 
clearly impugned or assailed the election held <i>in all the </i>265<i> 
precincts of the City of Iloilo</i>, as not free, orderly, nor honest, and as 
characterized by gross and rampant frauds, terrorism, coercion, corrupt 
practices, and other election irregularities, this resulting in the electors 
having been prevented from expressing their free choice (paragraphs 5 and 6 of 
the Protest). Petitioners, for their part, as protestees, joined issue with the 
adverse party by alleging in their answer that the election held on November 10, 
1959, in the entire city of Iloilo was held in the cleanest, most peaceful and 
honest manner, etc., its result reflecting the true and clear will of the 
electorate of said city; that the election in all of the 265 precincts of the 
city of Iloilo was free, orderly, etc., and was not a farcical election; that 
protestants indiscriminately protested the result "in all the electoral 
precincts in the city of Iloiio" in spite of the fact that the election in all 
the 265 precincts of said city was free, orderly, honest, etc.</p>
<p>The foregoing shows beyond question that the regularity of the election held 
in all the 265 precincts of the city of Iloiio was squarely in issue. Such being 
the case, it can not be correctly said that the mere addition of 14 other 
precincts to those enumerated in paragraph 9 of the original Protest—where 
respondents had alleged that "the regular Liberal Party Inspectors were 
anomalously and illegally changed with followers and supporters of the 
protestees, through dubious and questionable manipulations of the protestees 
and/or their leaders" constitutes a substantial amendment and changes the ground 
or grounds of protest alleged by respondents in their original pleading. The 
addition would seem to be merely in the nature of a bill of particulars in 
connection with the issue properly raised in the original Protest, namely, the 
regularity of the election held in all the 265 precincts of the city of Iloilo. 
In other words, as petitioners knew from the very beginning that the regularity 
of the election, in all the 265 precincts was in issue, the mere addition of 14 
precincts to those originally enumerated in paragraph 9 of the Protest did not 
compel them to meet a new issue.</p>
<p>In Gallares vs. Casenas, 48 Phil. 362, we held that protestant in said case 
should have been allowed to clarify certain allegations made in his original 
Protest. It seems clear, in accordance with this ruling, that where an issue had 
been actually pleaded in the previous pleading of a party, but its statement was 
not sufficiently clear, or lack of specifications made it indefinite or 
insufficient, an amendment may be allowed.</p>
<p>Again in Cecilio vs. Tomacruz, 62 Phil. 689, it appears that in the original 
counter protest, the protestee alleged that in certain specified precincts 20 
were not counted in his favor. Later, and after the lapse of the statutory 
period for the filing of protest, said protestee sought to amend his pleading by 
stating that in the aforesaid precincts, not 20 but 36 votes were not counted in 
his favor. He was allowed to make the corresponding amendment.</p>
<p>From the facts and circumstances surrounding the cases above-cited, it is 
manifest that the amendments were allowed because, in point of fact, they did 
not change the grounds of protest alleged in previous pleadings timely filed, 
and the opposing parties were not thereby forced to face new issues.</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, we hold that the respondent judge had 
jurisdiction to allow the amendment complained of and, that, in allowing it, he 
did not commit any grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of certiorari sought in the petition under consideration 
is denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is 
dissolved. With costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. 
B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
