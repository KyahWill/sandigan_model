				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Mascariñas has appealed on 
questions of law from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao
 (in its Case No. 3785) dismissing his petition for a writ of 
<em>Quo Warranto</em> against respondent 
Abellana.<p></p><p>The case, submitted to the court 
below upon a stipulation of facts, may be briefly summarized as follows:
 Respondent Monebrio F. Abellana had been nominated as Chief of Police 
of Davao City by the President of the Philippines, on 17 February 1955, 
and on 18 May 1955 his nomination was confirmed by the Commission on 
Appointments. But on 31 July 1957 the President designated 
herein petitioner-appellant Rafael P. Mascariñas to be "Acting Chief of 
Police of Davao City". Said appellant took his oath of office on 5 
August 1957 and informed the Civil Service Commissioner of his 
assumption of office on 28 August 1957. Two days previously, however, 
Abellana had informed the Davao City mayor that he was not vacating the 
office.</p><p>On 19 September 1957, the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines issued Special Order No. 64, calling Abellana to active 
military duty and placed him on detached service with the Office of the 
President. On 15 October 1957, Abellana wired the mayor of Davao City: 
"Am already on active duty effective sixteenth stop Mascarinas can 
assume. (Sgd.) Abellana". Opposition to appellant Mascariñas was, 
therefore, withdrawn and the latter assumed office as Acting Chief of 
Police.</p><p>Abellana served as Adviser on Police Matters 
in the Office of the President, and, with the approval of the Auditor 
General, collected, from 15 October 1957 to 28 February 1958, the 
difference between his army pay and that of Chief of Police of 
Davao.</p><p>On 21 May 1958, Mascariñas was in turn 
nominated by the President, and the next day he was confirmed as Chief 
of Police of Davao City. In July, 1959, Abellana instituted against 
Mascariñas Special Civil Case No. 3040 for <em>quo warranto in 
the</em> Davao Court of First Instance. The action was, on 1 
August 1959, dismissed for lack of cause of action, and the dismissal 
became final.</p><p>Reverted to inactive status effective 15
 April 1962, Abellana advised the Davao mayor of his intention to 
reassume the office of Police Chief, heretofore occupied by Mascariñas 
and as the Secretary of Justice opined in Abellana's favor and the 
Executive Secretary, on 27 June 1962, instructed that he be installed, 
the City Mayor notified Mascariñas to vacate and allowed Abellana to 
enter into the performance of his duties.</p><p>Mascariñas, 
who had been acting as Chief of Police until 29 June 1962, instituted 
the present <em>quo warranto</em> proceedings. The court 
below ruled in favor of Abellana, and Mascariñas appealed, contending 
that Abellana lost his right to the office by staying on military duty 
from 1957 to 1962; that his service in the office of the President was 
acceptance of an incompatible office that extinguished his right to his 
former position; that Abellana's failure to protest appellant's 
nomination and confirmation as Police Chief and failure to appeal the 
dismissal of his <em>quo warranto</em> suit against 
Mascariñas in 1959 barred Abellana from claiming the position of Davao 
City Chief of Police.</p><p>In support of his first 
contention, Mascariñas invokes our ruling in Maddumba <i>vs.</i> Ozaeta, 82 
Phil., 345, to the effect that section 49 of the National Defense Act 
(C.A. No. 1), protecting government employees in their positions when 
called into service as trainees, or called (for 30 days) for training as
 reservists, has no application to those who join the armed forces or 
the constabulary as regular members for a long period of 
time.</p><p>It is well" to observe, however, that the 
Maddumba case was decided on the basis of section 49 of Commonwealth Act
 No. 1, in its original form, that prescribed as follows:&nbsp; 
</p><blockquote><p>"SEC. 49. Any employee of the 
Government called for trainee instruction, or for regular annual active 
duty training, shall not be compelled to lose his position or to suffer a
 loss of pay due to his absence in the fulfillment of his military 
obligations."</p></blockquote><p>Subsequently, by 
Commonwealth Act No. 569, section 15, section 49, above quoted, was 
amended to read:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SEC. 
49. Any employee of the Government called for trainee instruction, or 
for regular annual active duty training, <em>or for extended tour 
of active duly</em>, shall not lose his position or suffer a loss 
of pay due to his absence in the fulfillment of his military 
obligations. A reserve officer on extended tour of active duty, 
regardless of the amount of his compensation in the civil position, 
shall be entitled to quarters or rental allowance as may be prescribed 
for his grade by Army regulations." (Emphasis 
supplied)</p></blockquote><p>The amendment includes 
respondent Abellana under its protective mantle, it being undisputed 
that he, being a reserve officer, was recalled to active duty, and not 
merely for training. In fact, under this amended provision, and in 
harmony therewith, the President issued Executive Orders No. 99, and 162
 (35 Off. Gaz. 1479 and 36 Off. Gaz., 2373), providing as 
follows:</p><p align="center">* * * * * * *&nbsp; 
</p><blockquote><p align="justify">"1. <em>No 
official or employee of the Government</em>, while undergoing 
trainee instruction or who, upon completing thereof, shall have been 
selected for additional training to qualify him a<em>s a 
commissioned or non-commissioned officer of the Reserve Force, or who 
shall have been called to regular annual active duly training, 
</em>or to extended tour of active duly in the Philippine Army, in
 case he holds a commission in the Reserve Force, <em>shall be 
compelled to lose his position</em> or to suffer any decrease of 
pay whatsoever due to his absence in the fulfillment of his military 
obligations." (Italics supplied)&nbsp; </p><p align="justify">"4. <em>Upon his relief from trainee 
instruction or extended tour of active duty</em> in the military 
service, the official or employee shall be <em>reinstated to his 
position in the Government </em>with all the rights and privileges
 thereof." (Philippine Annotated Laws, Vol. II, pp. 49-50) (Italics 
supplied)&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p align="justify">These provisions apply to Abellana's case, and are 
decisive to show that his five-year absence on military duty did not 
work any forfeiture of his right to reoccupy the civilian position of 
Chief of Police of Davao City to which he had been previously appointed 
and confirmed. As a military officer on tour of duty, petitioner could 
not disobey his assignment of the office of the Executive Secretary 
without violating military discipline, hence his stay there can not be 
considered a holding of an incompatible office.</p><p align="justify">Appellant Mascariñas places much stress on Abellana's
 1957 telegram to the mayor of Davao City the "Mascañas can be assume' 
as evidencing respondent's relinquishment of the disputed office. We see
 no basis for his stand. In 1957, Mascariñas was still 
<em>Acting</em> Chief of Police, and his assumption of 
office in such acting capacity in no way implied any derogation of 
Abellana's position as the true incumbent, temporarily absent on account
 of his recall to active military service.</p><p align="justify">Appellant Mascariñas also pleads that if Abellana 
desired to retain his post, he could have claimed exemption from 
military duty under section 64 of the National Defense Act (CA No. 1), 
for it is therein provided that civilians "during their period of 
employment or functions may have their trainee instruction deferred for 
not to exceed three years." But since Abellana was not being called for 
trainee instruction, section 64 did not apply to him.</p><p align="justify">The respondent-appelle M.N. Abellana should not have 
registered any protest against the nomination of appellant and its 
confirmation by the Commission on Appointments is without significance, 
for their validity depended entirely Police. As pointed out in the 
appealed decision, without significance, for their validity depended 
entirely on the existence of a vacant office both the nomination and its
 confirmation for that office were null and void <em>ab 
initio</em>. And section 49 of the National Defense Act, as 
amended by Commonwealth Act No. 569, makes it clear the Abellana's tour 
of duty with the Armed Forces did not create any vacancy not lose his 
position—due to his absence in the fulfillment of his military 
obligations". Protest or no protest, Mascariñas could not be rightfully 
appointed to the same position that Abellana was already 
occupying.</p><p align="justify"> Mascariñas' last argument 
is that the present action of Abellana is barred by the unconditional 
dismissal of Abellana's 1959 <em>quo warranto</em> suit 
(Case No. 3040). We agree with the lower court that this pretense is not
 tenable. In 1959, Abellana was still in active military service, and 
could not validity discharge the duties attached to his civilian office;
 hence the court dismissed his <em>quo warranto</em> for 
lack of cause of action. But in 1962 Abellana had reverted to inactive 
status; no conflicting obligations barred any longer his occupying the 
office of Chief of Police of Davao City and his right thereto fully 
accrued. The lower court correctly held that under the circumstances 
<em>res judicata</em> can not apply. </p><p align="justify">Wherefore, the decision appealed from, upholding the 
right of respondent-appellee Abellana to to office of Chief of Police of
 Davao City, is affirmed. Cost against petitioner-appellant Rafael F. 
Mascariñas.</p><p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo,
 Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J. P., 
</em>and<em> Zaldivar, JJ., 
</em>concur.</p><p><em>Judgment 
affirmed.</em></p></div>
