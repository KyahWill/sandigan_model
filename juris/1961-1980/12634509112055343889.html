<p class="BODY">It appears that after the execution of this in­strument, <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> and his wife mortgaged the same house in favor of

mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Reyes and
Navarro followed suit by filing in the Court of First Instance of Manila a peti­tion
for the consolidation of ownership of the house on the ground that the period
of redemption expired on July 12, 1961 without the vendees exercising their
right of repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for
consolidation of ownership was filed on October 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 23, the house was sold to De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>

</span>De Leon immediately took possession of the house, secured a discharge of
the mortgage on the house in favor of a rural bank by paying P2,000 and, on October
29, intervened in court and asked for the dismissal of the petition filed by
Reyes and Navarro on the ground that the unrecorded <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>

mainly based and submitted the case for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In confirming the ownership of Reyes and
Navarro in the house and the leasehold right to the lot, the court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is true that the original deed of sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>, dated January 12,
1961, was not signed by Belen Geronimo-<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>, wife
of the vendor <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>retro</u>, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>, at the time of its execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that on the occasion of
the extension of the period for re­purchase to <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1961</st1:date>, Belen Geronimo-<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>
signed giving her approval and conformity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This in act, in effect, constitutes ratification or confirmation of the
contract (Annex 'A' Stip­ulation) by Belen Geronimo-<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>,
which ratification validated the act of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>
from the moment of the execution of the said contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, such ratific­ation had the effect
of purging the contract (Annex 'A' Stipulation) of any <span style="">defect </span>which it might have had from the moment of its
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 1396, <span style="">New </span>Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;

<blockquote>"Again, it is to be noted that while it is true that the
original contract of <span style="">sale </span>with
right to repurchase in favor of the petitioners (Annex 'A' Stipulation) was not
signed by Belen Geronimo-<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>, such failure to
sign, to the mind of the Court, made the contract merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>,
if at all, and, therefore, susceptible of ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the sub­sequent ratification of the
said contract by Belen Geronimo-<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> validated the
said con­tract even before the property in question was mortgaged in favor of
the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also contended by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
that the contract of sale with right to repur­chase should be interpreted as a
mere equitable mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it
is argued that the same cannot form the basis for <span style="">a </span>judicial peti­tion for consolidation of title over the proper­ty
in litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is based on
the fact that the vendors <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> continued in pos­session of the
property after the execution of the deed of sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>
<u>de</u> <u>retro</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact,
however, that the vendors <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> con­tinued in the possession of
the property in ques­tion cannot justify an outright declaration that the <span style="">sale </span>should be construed <span style="">as an </span>equitable mort­gage and not a
sale with right to repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms
of the deed of sale with right to repurchase (Annex A' Stipulation) relied upon
by the peti­tioners must be considered <span style="">as
</span>merely an equitable mortgage for the reason that after the expiration of
the period or repurchase of three months from <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1961</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the present case, it appears, however, that no other
instrument was executed between the parties extending the period of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done was simply to annotate on the
deed of sale with right to repurchase (Annex <span style="">A</span>1<span style=""> </span>Stipul­ation)
that the period to repurchase, extended as requested until <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1961</st1:date><span style="">’</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the
purchasers <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>, in the exercise of their freedom to make
contracts, have the power to ex­tend the period of repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such extension is valid and effective as it
is not contrary to any provision of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Umale</span> vs. Fernandez, 28 Phil. 89, 93)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The deed of sale with right to repurchase (Annex ‘<span style="">A’ </span>Stipulation) is embodied in a
public document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the same
is sufficient for the purpose of transferring the rights of the vendors <u>a</u>
<u>retro</u> over the property in ques­tion in favor of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that the deed of sale with
right to repurchase (Annex ‘A’ Stipulation) was executed on January 12, 1961,
which was very much ahead in point of time to the execution of the real estate
mortgage on October 4, 1961, in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
(Annex <span style="">‘B’ </span>Stipulation).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious, therefore, that when the
mortgagors, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> and Belen Geronimo-<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>, ex­ecuted the real estate mortgage in favor of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, they were no longer the absolute owners of the
property since the same had already <span style="">been
sold <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> to the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The spouses <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>, therefore, could no longer
constitute a </span><span style="">valid mortgage over
the property inasmuch </span>as <span style="">they
did not have any free disposition of the property mortgaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 2085, </span><span style="">New Civil Code.) For a valid </span><span style="">mortgage to exist, owner­ship of the property mortgaged is an essential
requisite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mortgage </span><span style="">executed </span><span style="">by one who </span>is <span style="">not the
owner of the property mortgaged is without legal existence and its registration
cannot validate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Philippine National
Bank vs. Rocha, 55 Phil. 497)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> invokes the
provisions of article 1544 of the New <span style="">Civil
Code </span>for the reason that while the real estate mortgage in <span style="">his favor (Annex 'B' Stipulation) has been re­</span>gistered
with the Register of Deeds of Manila under the provisions of Act No. 3344 on
Novem­ber 3, 1961, the deed of sale with right to repurchase (Annex 'A'
Stipulation) however, has not been duly registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1544 of the New Civil Code, however,
refers to the <span style="">sale </span>of the same
property to two or more vendees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
provision of law, therefore, is not applicable to the present case which does
not involve sale of the same property to two or more vendees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the mere registration of the pro­perty
mortgaged in favor of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> under Act No.
3344 does not prejudice the inter­ests of the petitioners who have a better
right over the property in question under the old <span style="">principle </span>of first in time, better in right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(Gallardo
vs. Gallardo, C.B., </span>46 O.G. 5568)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">De Leon appealed directly
to this Court, contending (1) that the </span><span style="">sale in question </span><span style="">is not
only <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> but void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for
having been made by <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> without the consent of </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">wife; (2) that the </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pacto</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <u>retro</u> </span><span style="">sale is </span><span style="">in reality an equitable mortgage and
therefore can not </span>be the <span style="">basis </span>of
a petition for consolidation of <span style="">ownership;
</span>and (3) that at any rate the <span style="">sale,
</span>being unrecorded, can­not affect third parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are in accord with the
</span><span style="">trial court's ruling that </span>a
<span style="">conveyance of real property of the
conjugal partnership </span><span style="">made by the
husband without the </span>consent <span style="">of
his wife is </span>merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from article 173 of the Civil
Code which gives the wife ten years within which to bring an action for
annulment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such it can be ratified as
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lanuza's</span></span><span style=""> wife in effect did in this case when she
gave her conformity to the extension of the period of redemption by signing the
annotation on the margin of the deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
may add that actions for the annulment of <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>
contracts can be brought only by those who are bound under it, either
principally or <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> (art. 1397), so that if
there was anyone who could have questioned the sale on this ground it was <span class="SpellE">Lanuza's</span> wife alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We also agree with the
lower court that between an unrecorded sale of a prior date and </span>a <span style="">recorded mortgage of </span>a later date the <span style="">former </span>is <span style="">preferred to the latter for the reason that if the original owner had
parted with his ownership of the thing sold then he no longer had the ownership
and free disposal of that thing so as to be able to mortgage it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Registration of the mortgage under Act No.
3344 would, in such </span>case, <span style="">be of
no moment since it is understood to be without prejudice to the better right of
third parties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nor would it avail the mortgagee any to

<p class="BODY">But there is one aspect of this <span style="">case</span> which leads us to a <span style="">different
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is </span>a <span style="">point which neither the parties nor the trial
court </span>appear <span style="">to have sufficiently
considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We refer to the nature of
the so-called "Deed of </span>Sale with <span style="">Right to Repurchase" and the claim that it is in reality an
equitable mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">raised the question below and again in
this Court in his second assignment of error, he has not demonstrated his
point; neither has he pursued the logical implication of his argument beyond
stating that a petition for </span>consolidation <span style="">of ownership </span>is <span style="">an
inappropriate remedy to enforce a mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">De Leon based his claim
that the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <u>retro</u> sale is actually an equitable mortgage on the fact that,
first, the supposed vendors (the <span class="SpellE">Lanuzas</span>) remained in
possession of the thing sold and, second, when the three-month period </span><span style="">of redemption expired the parties extended
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are circumstances which indeed
indicate an equitable mortgage.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But their relevance emerges only when they
are seen in the perspective of other circumstances which indubitably show that
what was intended was a mortgage and not </span>a <span style="">sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the parties as well as in the decision of the trial court, the fact has not
been men­tioned that for the price of P3,000, the supposed vendors
"sold" not only their house, which they described as new and as being
made of strong materials and which alone had an assessed value of P4,000, but
also their leasehold right, television set and refrigerator, "<span class="SpellE">Kelvinator</span>' of nine cubic feet in size."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the petition for con­solidation of
ownership is limited to the house and the leasehold right, while the
stipulation of facts of the parties merely referred to the object of the sale
as "the property in question."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The failure to highlight this point, that, is, the gross inadequacy of
the price paid, accounts for the error in determining the true agreement of the
parties to the deed.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. <u>The delay in the filing of the petition consolidation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still another point obviously overlooked in
the consideration of this case is the fact that the period of redemption
expired on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1961</st1:date>
and yet this action was not brought until <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1962</st1:date> and only after De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had asked on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1962</st1:date>
for the extra-judicial foreclosure of his mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the while, the <span class="SpellE">Lanuzas</span>
remained in possession of the properties they were supposed to have sold and
they remained in possession even long after they had lost their right of
redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances we cannot but conclude that the deed in
question <span style="">is </span>in reality <span style="">a </span>mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This con­clusion is of far-reaching
consequences because it <span style="">means </span>not
only that this action for consolidation of ownership is improper, as De Leon
claims, but, what <span style="">is </span>more, that
between the unrecorded deed of Reyes and Navarro which we hold to be an
equitable mortgage, and the registered mortgage of De Leon, the latter must be
preferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preference of mortgage
credits is determined by the priority of registration of the mortgages,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

Under article 2125 of the Civil Code, the equit­able mortgage, while valid
between Reyes and Navarro, on the one hand, and the <span class="SpellE">Lanuzas</span>,
on the other, as the imme­diate parties thereto, cannot prevail over the
registered mortgage of De Leon.</p>
