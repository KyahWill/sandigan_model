				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 4, 1958, during one of the riots and disturbances which, over a 
protracted period, rocked the national penitentiary at Muntinlupa, wherein two 
rival groups of prisoners known as "Oxo" and "Sige-sige" gangs were principally 
involved, four convicts figured among the fatalities: Ernest Tolentino, Monico 
Tanquin, Jose Blanco and Dominador Arcilla. For that particular incident six 
other convicts were charged with multiple murder in the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal (criminal case No. 7697). They are Ruben de la Cruz, Ceferino Banguion, 
Feliciano Dante, Tranquilino Oroc, German Puertas and Espiridion Perez.
<p>The information filed against them alleges conspiracy, evident premeditation 
and treachery, quasi-rescidivism and six other aggravating circumstances as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the crime was committed with insult to public authorities;</p>
<p>"2. That the crime was committed by a band;</p>
<p>"3. That the crime was committed by armed men or persons who insure or afford 
impunity;</p>
<p>"4. Use of superior strength or means was employed to weaken the defense.</p>
<p>"5. That as a means to the commission of the crime, doors and windows have 
been broken; and</p>
<p>"6. That the crime was committed where public authorities were engaged in the 
discharge of their duties."</p></blockquote>
<p>With the assistance of a lawyer <i>de oficio</i>, the defendants were 
arraigned on March 15,1958. Three of them, namely, Ruben de la Cruz, Ceferino 
Banguion and Feliciano Dante, entered a plea of guilty while the rest pleaded 
not guilty.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1958 the Court <i>a quo</i> rendered its decision, of which the 
dispositive portion is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime as charged in the above-quoted information, which 
also alleges that the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism is present 
together with six other aggravating circumstances. There is only one mitigating 
circumstance present, that is the plea of guilty, but since this is not enough 
to offset the above aggravating circumstances, the Court hereby sentences the 
accused to suffer the maximum penalty provided by law which is death and to 
indemnify the heirs of each of the offended party in the sum of P3,000.00 and to 
pay their corresponding share of the costs. </p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the same date the record was ordered elevated to this Court in view of the 
penalty imposed, pursuant to Rule 118, Section 9, in relation to section 17 of 
Republic Act No. 296. Another attorney <i>de oficio</i> was appointed to present 
their case for purposes of review. He now asks that the case be remanded for new 
trial on three grounds: "(1) that the accused entered a plea of guilty 
improvidently, or without a clear and precise understanding of its meaning and 
effect; (2) that because of the great incompetency, gross negligence and 
indifference of counsel <i>de oficio</i> appointed by the trial court, the 
accused were prevented from fairly presenting their defense, thereby resulting 
in their great prejudice; and (3) that irregularities were committed during the 
arraignment which, in effect, deprived defendants-appellants of their 
constitutional right to counsel."</p>
<p>Accompanying the brief for the three accused is a joint affidavit executed by 
them June 15, 1959, or over one year since the pronouncement of sentence, in 
which they deny having killed Monico Tanquin, one of the alleged victims, and 
declare that they killed the three others in self-defense; that they so informed 
their lawyer before arraignment, but he prevailed upon them to plead guilty, 
assuring them that if they did so they would "get only forty (40) years prison 
term or at most life imprisonment and that if they did not plead guilty they 
would surely get the death penalty." The affidavit itself rules out the theory 
of self-defense and reveals that the defendants entered their plea under a full 
consciousness of guilt, for otherwise they would shrink even from the 
possibility of a life sentence. Noteworthy is the fact that the other three who 
were accused with them and for whom the same counsel <i>de oficio</i> had been 
appointed entered a plea of not guilty and chose instead to go to trial.</p>
<p>This Court finds no compelling reason to remand this case for new trial 
particularly in view of the finding of the Court <i>a quo</i> that the 
defendants pleaded guilty voluntarily and spontaneously, that they entered such 
plea because they had been assured by counsel that by so doing they would 
receive at most a life sentence, and the fact that the requisite number of votes 
among the members of this Court is not sufficient to affirm the penalty of 
death, thus making the penalty next lower in degree mandatory, pursuant to 
Section 9 of Republic Act No. 296.</p>
<p>Wherefore, modified in the sense that the three accused should suffer the 
penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with the accessory penalties provided by 
law, the judgment of the Court <i>a quo</i> is affirmed, with costs.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>Regala, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
