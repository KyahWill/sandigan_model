				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This <span style="">is </span>an appeal from the <span style="">decision of </span>the <span style="">Court </span>of First Instance of Manila in
its <span style="">Civil </span>Case No. 48793 denying
appellant's petition for <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> with preliminary </span>injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally taken to the Court of Appeals,
this case was subsequently certified to us there being no question of fact
involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, Juan <span class="SpellE">Soria</span>, came to the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region> on
<st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1960</st1:date> as <span style="">a </span>temporary
visitor for the purpose of visiting his relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His authorized stay was for one (1<span style="">) </span>month, but it was repeatedly
extended, the <span style="">last extension being
until </span><st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1960" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1960</st1:date>, the petitioner, through counsel, requested the
Commissioner of <span style="">Immigration </span>that
he be admitted as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged, among other things, that he was <span style="">born </span>in <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, on September 23, 1918; that he was an
illegitimate son of one Maria <span class="SpellE">Soria</span>, a Filipino
citizen, and Chua <span class="SpellE">Chemco</span>, a Chinese; that along with
his mother and sister, he was taken to China by his father sometime in 1931;
that his father died in China while his mother was still living; that in 1949
he escaped to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> from the Chinese mainland;
that while in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> he made representations with
the Philippine consulate there so that he might be allowed to enter the
Philippines as a returning Filipino citizen, but that no action was taken
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was heard on December
16 and 29, 1960 and on <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="2">February 21,
 1961</st1:date> by an investigator in the Bureau of Immigration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1961</st1:date> the investigator
submitted his Citizen Evaluation Board Report, giving a summary of the material
allegations of the petition as well as the evidence submitted to substantiate
them, and concluding that "Juan <span class="SpellE">Soria</span> is a
Filipino <span style="">citizen by </span>illegitimate
birth, entitled to recognition as such." Upon review of said report, the
Commissioner of Immigration found the evidence presented in­sufficient to prove
<span style="">the </span>petitioner's claim of
illegitimacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he denied
the petition in a letter dated <st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="3">March
 22, 1961</st1:date>, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1961</st1:date></blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Soria</span> </blockquote>

<blockquote>S <span class="SpellE">i</span> r :</blockquote>

<blockquote>Please be advised that your peti­tion for recognition as a Philippine
citizen was denied by the Commissioner of Immigration, for insufficiency of
evidence that you are the illegitimate son of a Chinese father and a Filipino
mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For the
Commissioner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Chief, Law &amp; Investigation</blockquote>

<blockquote>Division"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> letter
the petitioner went to the Court of First Instance of Manila on a petition for <i>mandamus</i>
with preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. 47781), praying that he be declared
a citizen of the Philip­pines, and that respondent Commissioner of Immigration <span style="">be compelled to cause his documentation as
such and restrained from ordering his deportation before final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­fore the case could be heard on the
merits, however, the petitioner's counsel moved to dismiss the petition on the
ground that his client had left the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and had lost interest in the further
prosecution of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its order
dated </span><st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="10"><span style="">October 28, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court granted the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that while the <i>mandamus</i> case was pending in the
lower court the petitioner was able to secure from the Department of Foreign
Affairs his documentation as a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="11">November
 2, 1961</st1:date> the Philippine Vice-Consul in <st1:place><st1:city>Bangkok</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Thailand</st1:country-region></st1:place>, issued to the
petitioner a Certificate of Registration and Identity certifying "that <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Soria</span> has been documented
as Philippine citizen pursuant to SECFORAF'S Cable No. 1676-V dated <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1961</st1:date>." Armed with
said certificate, the petitioner came back to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1961</st1:date> and
sought admission as a Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Bureau of Immigration denied him entry on the ground that
he was improperly documented and that he was still an alien as shown by the
records of the said office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioner of Immigration thereupon ordered his arrest and exclusion from the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To forestall the execution of the said order the petitioner, on
November 18, 1961, went to the Court of First Instance of Manila on a petition
for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction, praying that "judgment
be rendered declaring the petitioner a citizen of the Philip­pines at birth;
annulling the order in question and directing the respondent Commissioner of
Immigration and all persons acting under him to desist from arresting the
petitioner and excluding him from the Philippines and otherwise molesting him
and treating him as an alien." In support of his allegation that the
respondent Commis­sioner of Immigration had acted without or in excess of his
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order complained
of, the petitioner contended, among other things, that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) said respondent arbitrarily set aside the
findings of the Department of Foreign Affairs that he was a Filipino citizen
without considering the evidence submitted to the Philippine Vice-Consul in
Bangkok, Thailand and without knowing the basis for the official act of said
Department; and (2) the questioned order was based on an incomplete <span style="">and </span>irregular investigation of his
request for admission as a Filipino citizen where no final or formal decision
was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the <span style="">petitioner was seeking a review not only of
the order of exclusion but also of the denial of his petition for admission as
a Filipino citizen, which was the subject of his petition for <i>mandamus</i>
previously dismissed by <span style="">the lower court
</span></span><span style="">upon motion </span><span style="">of his own counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that the respondent had neither
abused his discretion nor acted without jurisdiction in both instances, the
trial court dismissed the petition on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="7"><span style="">July 1, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner moved to reconsider but was turned down; hence, this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Several errors are alleged to have been committed by the lower
court, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in denying the
petition for <i>certiorari</i>; (2) in holding that the respondent did not
abuse his authority; (3) in applying the memorandum circular of the Department
of Justice dated <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1958</st1:date>;
and (4) in not declaring that he <span style="">is </span>a
Filipino citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first and second assigned errors the petitioner
contends that he was not given <span style="">a </span><span style="">full, </span><span style="">fair and </span>free hearing by the
respondent Commissioner of Immigration, and was denied the right to present all
his evi­dence in support of his claim of illegitimacy, as shown by the
following portion of the transcript of his testimony:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Do you have anything else to say or
submit in support of your allegations that you are the illegitimate son of a
Chinese father and a Filipino mother?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
more for the present.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MANIFESTATION BY COUNSEL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We wish to reserve the right to present the
relatives of petitioner and such other documents as we may later on deem fit to
submit in support of his claim of illegitimacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime we are submitting Exhibits A to J to form part of his
evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That <span style="">is </span>all."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of the contention of the petitioner, the lower court
made the following observation:</p>

<blockquote>"After going over the records of this case, <span style="">particularly </span>the evidence presented by
the petitioner during the said investigation to prove that he <span style="">was </span>the illegitimate son of a Chinese
father and a Filipino mother, the Court believes that no better evi­dence than
that already presented during the investigation could be presented by the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appearing that his birth
certificate or <span style="">a
</span>certified copy thereof cannot be presented in evidence by the petitioner
in support of his petition, <span style="">and </span><span style="">secondary evidence </span><span style="">having been </span>introduced during the
investigation, it <span style="">is </span>believed that the other evi­dence that the petitioner might
have presented would only be <span class="SpellE">cummulative</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the investigator, Atty.
Leon M. de Villa, considered the evidence presented by the peti­tioner as
sufficient to establish his claim that he was the illegitimate son of <span style="">a </span>Chinese father and a Filipino
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the respondent Com­missioner
of Immigration has the right and authority to disregard the conclusion and
disapprove the recom­mendation of the investigator."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not see that the lower court committed the first two errors
assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place the
hearings wherein the petitioner submitted evidence, as well as the respondent's
decision based thereon, preceded the petition for <i>mandamus</i> which was
dismissed upon the petitioner's own motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, in filing that petition he considered the evidence already
complete and was willing to stand thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, the petitioner merely says that the additional evidence he
intended to present is material, but he fails to state what it consists of and
how it would bear on his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
he has merely reproduced in his brief the complete report of the investigator
and prays that reference be made to the findings therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is also </span>to be
noted that the manifestation of the petitioner's counsel reserving the right to
present additional evidence was made during the hearing on December 16, 1960;
that before the investigator sub­mitted his report two more hearings were held
- one on December 29, 1960 and the other on February 21, 1961; and that during
those two hearings the petitioner presented various documents as well as two
witnesses who testified in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidently there <span style="">is </span>no
basis for the petitioner's contention that he was not given a full, fair and
free hearing by the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also contends that the respondent committed a
grave abuse of discretion by not writing a decision discussing the issues
involved instead of <span style="">merely noting
"Denied for insufficiency of evidence" across the last page of the
report of the investigator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner overlooks the fact that the Chief of the Law and Investigation
Division of the Bureau of Immigra­tion, in behalf of the Commissioner, sent him
a letter dated March 22, 1961, advising him his "petition for recognition
as a Philippine citizen was denied by the Com­missioner of Immigration, for
insufficiency of evidence that you are the illegitimate son of a Chinese father
and a Filipino mother." It is clear that the said letter <span style="">is </span>itself the decision, and that
although it does not contain an extended opinion, it nevertheless discloses the
only issue involved and reason for the ruling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the third assignment of error, the petitioner, who did
not present his birth certificate before the respondent, now avers that the
lower court should not have applied the second sentence of the last paragraph
of the Memorandum Circular of the Secretary of Justice dated August 28, 1958,
which provides that "where the petition for cancellation of such alien
certificate of registration is based on the alleged illegitimacy of the
petitioner, no such cancellation shall be effected unless his birth certi­ficate
or a certified copy thereof <span style="">is </span>presented
in evidence in support of the petition." He argues that this provision of
the circular <span style="">is </span>contrary to both
the law and the constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The averment of petitioner is premised on a wrong
assumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his memorandum submitted
to the lower court the petitioner proceeded on the theory that the denial of
his petition for admission as a Filipino citizen was not <span style="">final </span>because the respondent's
findings were not submitted to the Department of Justice, as required by the
communication of the Secretary of Justice dated <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In rejecting the petitioners contention, the lower court held that the
communication relied upon had been superseded by the Memorandum Circular of the
Secretary of Justice dated August 28, 1958, quoting the last para­graph thereof
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitions for the cancellation of alien certificates of
registration should, in the first instance, be decided on the merits by the
Commissioner of Immigration, and his decision thereon shall be final, unless
the interested party desires to appeal to the Secretary of <span style="">Justice or to the proper court of justice if
he believes that the decision of the Commissioner of Immigration is palpably
contrary to law or has committed a clear abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, where the petition for
cancellation <span style="">is </span>based on the
alleged illegitimacy of the petitioner no such cancellation shall be effected
unless his birth cer­tificate or a certified copy there­of <span style="">is </span>presented in evidence in support of
the petition."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that although the second sentence was included in
the foregoing quotation, it was neither applied nor relied upon by the lower
court, since it was irrelevant to the petitioner's contention therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Court did was to rule adversely upon
<span style="">the peti­tioner's argument </span>that
since the respondent's decision was not submitted to the Department of Justice
it never acquired the character of finality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The last assigned error,
namely, that <span style="">the lower court erred </span>in
not declaring the petitioner a Filipino citizen, is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His petition was for <i>certiorari</i> and
this remedy <span style="">is </span>available against
action taken without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of dis­cretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of respondent Commissioner of
Immigration for the <span style="">exclusion </span>of
petitioner falls under neither category; </span><span style="">and the facts on </span><span style="">which
the said order was based were not properly in issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that one of the prayers in the
petition is that judgment be rendered declaring peti­tioner a citizen of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
it is now well-settled that there <span style="">is </span>no
proceeding established by law, or the rules, for the judicial declaration of
the citizenship of an individual.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the case of Tan vs. Republic, G. R. No.
L-16108, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="10"><span style="">October 31, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"If the petition be considered as one for declaratory
judgment, the facts do not warrant the filing of the said special civil
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the <span style="">petition </span>seeks to compel the Commis­sioner of Immigration to
cancel her and her children's alien certificate of registration, this petition
would not lie because such a remedy of cancellation of alien certificate of
registration can only be had by virtue of a judgment of a competent court, in
an action where the citizen­ship of parties is <span style="">a </span>material matter in issue, declaring
the Filipino citizenship of the petitioner and her children, and such
declaration can­not be obtained directly because there <span style="">is </span>no proceeding at present provided
by law or the rules for such purpose."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
