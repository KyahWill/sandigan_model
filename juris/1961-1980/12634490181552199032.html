  <span class="SpellE">Ylaya</span> St.</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>
(Francisco <span class="SpellE">Dy</span>, proprietor), purchased from <span class="SpellE">Ernerose</span> Commercial of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(Ernesto J. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, proprietor) 90 bales of assorted
textiles and rags valued at P117<span class="GramE">,731.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said 90 bales had been <u><span style="">imported and entered thru the </span></u><st1:place><st1:placetype><u><span style="">Port</span></u></st1:placetype><u><span style=""> of </span></u><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u>Cebu</u></span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ernerose</span> Commercial shipped the
merchandise from <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City to Manila, as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) 50 bales declared as rayon
rags aboard M/V <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, voyage 229, bill of lad­ing
No. 1, arriving in North Harbor, Manila, on October 5, 1964; and (2) 40 bales
declared as rayon rags aboard M/V <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, voyage
139, bill of lading No. 4, arriving in North Harbor, Manila, on October 6,
1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the goods were about to leave Customs premises, Customs
authorities held them for further verification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">And upon </span>their
examination they were found to be different from the declaration the cargo
manifest of the carrying vessels aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial subsequently
demanded - on October 14, 15 and 23 - the release of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Asserted as grounds for
release were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Francindy</span>
Commercial is a purchaser in good faith; a local purchase was involved so the
Customs bureau has no right to examine the goods; and that the goods came from
a coastwise port.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial moreover filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1964</st1:date> a petition for <i style="">mandamus</i> in the Court of First Instance
of Manila against the Commissioner and Collector of Customs, to compel the
Customs authorities to release the goods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It alleged that the Customs bureau has no jurisdiction over the goods,
the <span style="">same </span>not being imported to
the Port of Manila, citing Sec. 1206 of the Tariff Code; that <span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial is not liable for duties and taxes,
the transaction not being an original importation, citing Sec. 1204 of the
Tariff Code; that the goods are not in the hands of the importer nor subject to
said importer's control, nor were they imported con­trary to law with <span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial's knowledge, citing Sec. 2531, Tariff
Code; and that the importation had been terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The North Harbor Customs Collector made a report of seizure on <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1964</st1:date>, the Manila Customs Collector issued a warrant of seizure
and detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as
Seizure Identifica­tion No. 8422.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1964</st1:date>,
the Commissioner and Collector of Customs filed a motion to dismiss the
petition in the Court of First Instance of Manila, for lack of jurisdic­tion,
lack of cause of action and in view of the pending seizure and forfeiture
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance held resolution of said motion in
abeyance pending its decision on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1964</st1:date>,
it granted preventive and mandato­ry injunction upon a bond of P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said writ was
is­sued on <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner and Collector of Customs moved for
reconsideration on <st1:date year="1964" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="1">January
 6, 1965</st1:date>, they moved to lift the preliminary and mandatory
injunction writ and for the resolution of their motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, however, on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1965</st1:date> or­dered them to comply with the
preliminary and mandatory injunction, upon the filing of an additional bond of
P50<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Customs authorities thereupon filed with <span class="GramE">Us</span>
on <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1965</st1:date> this
petition for <i style="">certiorari</i> and prohibition
with preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court,
on January 20, 1965, gave due course to the petition and granted preliminary
injunction without bond; said writ was issued on January 22, 1965, enjoining
until further orders respondents and their agents from enforcing the preventive
and mandatory injunction of the court below and from assuming jurisdiction or
taking cognizance of the petition filed by <span class="SpellE">Francindy</span>
Commercial therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">After issues were joined, and the case was submitted for
decision, respondent <span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial moved to
dissolve <span class="GramE">Our</span> preliminary injunction; action thereon
was deferred until the case is resolved on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition raises two related issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, has the Customs bureau jurisdiction to
seize the goods and institute forfeiture proceedings against them? <span class="GramE">and</span> (2) has the Court of First Instance jurisdiction to
entertain the petition for <i style="">mandamus</i>
to compel the Customs authorities to release the goods?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial contends that since
the peti­tion in the Court of First Instance was filed (on October 26, 1964)
ahead of the issuance of the Customs warrant of seizure and forfeiture (on
November 12, 1964), the Customs bureau should yield to the jurisdiction of the
said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows, however, that the goods in question <u>were
actually seized on </u><st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="10"><u>October 6,
 1964</u></st1:date>, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., before <span class="SpellE">Francindy</span>
Commercial sued in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of
the seizure by the Customs bureau was to verify whether or not Customs duties
and taxes were paid for their importation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1964</st1:date>,
Customs released 22 bales thereof, for the same were found to have been
released regularly from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place> (Petition, Annex
"L").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to goods imported
illegally or released irregularly from Customs custody, these are subject to
seizure under Section 2530 m. of the Tariff and Customs Code (RA 1957).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bureau of Customs has jurisdiction and power, among others,
to collect revenues from imported articles, fines and penalties accruing under
tariff and customs laws; to prevent and suppress smuggling and other frauds <span style="">on </span>customs; and to enforce tariff and
customs laws (Sec. <span style="">602, </span>Republic
Act 1957).</p>

<p class="BODY">The goods in question are imported articles entered at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should they be found to have been released
irregularly from Customs custody in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
they are subject to seizure and forfeiture, the proceed­ings for which comes
within the jurisdiction of the Bu­reau of Customs pursuant to Republic Act
1937.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Said </span>proceedings
should be followed; the owner of the goods may set up defenses therein (<span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>, L-22526, Nov.
29, 1966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the decision of the Com­missioner
of Customs appeal lies to the Court of Tax Ap­peals, as provided in Sec. 2402
of Republic Act 1937 and Sec. 11 of Republic Act 1125.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To permit recourse to the Court of First
Instance in cases of seizure of imported goods would in effect render
ineffective the power of the Customs authorities under the Tariff Code and
deprive the Court of Tax Appeals of one of its exclusive appellate jurisdictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has ruled in <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ave­ria</span>, supra, Republic
Acts 1937 and 1125 vest jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture proceedings
exclusively upon the Bureau of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such law being special in nature, while the
Judiciary Act defining the jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance is a
general legislation, not to mention that the former are later enactments, the
Court of First Instance should yield to the jurisdiction of the Customs
authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span>
judgment is hereby rendered dismissing for lack of jurisdiction the petition
filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Francindy</span> Commercial in the Court
of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 58786) and rendering permanent the
preliminary injunction writ herein issued against respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
