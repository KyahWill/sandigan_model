<blockquote>After a reinvestigation, and specifically on 23 February 1967, the
Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> moved that the case
against Federico U. Cruz be dropped for the reasons that only witness Domingo <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> appeared, and "for lack of interest" on
the part of the victim's widow.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="2">28 February 1967</st1:date>, the
court dismissed before the plea the case against Federico U. Cruz<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
thus leaving <span class="SpellE">Guba</span> as the lone accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence for the prosecution shows that on 3 March 1965 Domingo
<span class="SpellE">Alican</span>, one of prosecution witnesses herein, went to
the house of the deceased, Jose Fernandez, in barrio Torres, <span class="SpellE">Mapandan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, for the
purpose of buying sugar (<span class="SpellE"><u>tagapolot</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alican</span> followed
Fernandez to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> when Fernandez'
wife informed him that her husband was there. Having found Fernandez, both
proceeded to the parking space of tricycles to board one in returning to the
house of Fernandez where <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> was going to see the
sugar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Fernandez was talking to
the driver, <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> was hit at the left back part of
his head with a stone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez ran
because stones were also being thrown at him.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Alican</span> then went to see the Chief of
Police of <span class="SpellE">Mapandan</span> to complain about the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there, Jose Fernandez
arrived accompanied by a corporal and a policeman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Municipal judge Federico U. Cruz, the
other accused in the information, arrived and remarked, "So, you are here
again, Jose. May be you are the one again who caused the trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me see how tough you are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will put out your soul." Corroborating
witness, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span>, quoted the judge as
specifically saying<i>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>"Jose
you are here now to pay for your faults.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tonight, we will vanish your soul," translated from the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> dialect, "<span class="SpellE"><u>Ibalang</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">tay</span> <span class="SpellE">camareruam</span></u>."
After this, the judge allegedly instructed the Chief of Police to file a
complaint for public scandal against the two and put them in jail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jose Fernandez and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> were
thus detained in the municipal jail on <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">3
 March 1965</st1:date> at 5 in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both were still in jail in the early dawn of the following day when Pat.
Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Guba</span>, identified in court as the accused,
came and awakened Fer­nandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused, calling Fernandez as "<span class="SpellE">Bayao</span>"(appellant
being a cousin of Fernandez' wife), said that he was already off-duty and that
he was going to help Fernandez secure a bond for his release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez then asked how much bond was
necessary for him and <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> and the accused answered
that it was P1,000.00 for each.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After fetching water for <span class="SpellE">Alican</span>,
Fernandez and the accused went out again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About 30 minutes after they left, the inmates heard one gun report,
which led them to nudge each other, and <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> to
remark, "I think they shot Jose." The detainees numbered 8, including
<span class="SpellE">Alican</span> and Fernandez.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PC corporal <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span>, accompanied by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Petrola</span>, soon after arrived at the jail and inquired from
the inmates if they knew that Fernandez was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said further that any one who would tell
that Fernandez was brought out of jail to be killed would be the next to suffer
the same fate. Pat. <span class="SpellE">Petrola</span> then ordered the
prisoners to go to sleep and not to talk about the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about 5 or 6 in the morning of the same
date, Judge Cruz also visited the inmates in jail and likewise ordered them not
to talk about what happened, otherwise what befell Fernandez would also happen
to them.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Alican's</span> testimony up to this point was
substantially corroborated by Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span>, the
other prosecution witness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="5">3 May 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> was in a cockpit in barrio <span class="SpellE">Licsi</span>
when the accused-appellant saw and called him saying that if he (<span class="SpellE">Alican</span>) wanted to live, he should not be a witness
regarding the death of Jose Fer­nandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alican</span> answered "how" when he already signed the
subpoena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused then tried to draw
his gun, but <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> was able to wrest the same from
the accused. This gun was surrendered by <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> to
policeman <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span> at the Municipal Hall of <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alican</span> then filed a
criminal complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
against Pat. <span class="SpellE">Guba</span> with the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span> as a result of this incident, while the latter
filed a countercharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case,
however, was settled upon the intervention of politicians.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Rosario <span class="SpellE">Guba</span>, widow of the deceased
Fernandez, was also called to testify.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She learned about her husband's death that same morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">4 March 1965</st1:date> in her house through her
father. She then went to the <span class="SpellE"><u>presidencia</u></span> in
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw many people at the back
thereof when she arrived, among them, Judge Cruz, the accused, and the
municipal health officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Al. <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span>, Jr. Her husband's body was being opened and
autopsied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked why they did not
wait for her, but Dr. <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span> answered that she
arrived very late and that they were looking for the bullet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also asked the accused, who is her second
cousin, why he shot her husband and the accused answered that Fernandez was
running away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then remarked that he
could have just shot him in the leg, to which he did not reply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mrs. Fernandez' father went to <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> in
the meantime to seek the aid of the NBI (National Bureau of Investigation), but
it was only in the following day that the NBI came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The body of the husband was moved to their
house at already 6 in the afternoon because they waited for that help.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Death Certificate dated <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="3">5
 March 1965</st1:date>, signed by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span>, Jr.,
shows that Fernandez died of shock due to profuse hemorrhage caused by a
gunshot wound.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Death occurred at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="3">3:30 am</st1:time>. of <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="3">4 March 1965</st1:date> at the public plaza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probable distance between assailant and
the victim was placed at about 22 feet.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The defense, on the other hand, does not contest the fact that the
victim died of gunshot wound and that it was the accused who shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact it admitted Exhibit "B",
the Death Certificate, when the same was presented by the prosecution. However,
the reason given by the accused-appellant for the shooting was that the victim
was running away and would not stop despite warning shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, claimed by the defense that
the accused did not incur criminal liability for the killing because it occurred
in the course of performing an official duty which was to prevent the escape of
a prisoner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused-appellant himself recounted that he was on duty as guard of
the municipal building from 8 in the morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="3">3 March 1965</st1:date> to 8 in the morning of the following day, 4
March.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 3 in the morning of this
latter day, Jose Fernandez, one of the eight detainees, and the deceased
herein, asked permission from him to go out to attend to his personal
necessities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant opened
the door<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and Fernandez went out first, while the former locked the door by inserting a
chain through a hole therein, which took sometime to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant did not see Fernandez
after he locked the door, so he looked for the said detainee in the toilet
which was about 10 meters from jail, but Fernandez was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When accused-appellant did not find Fernandez
in the municipal building, he looked around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was then that he saw Fernandez crossing the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant called Fernandez to stop
twice but the latter did not do so; he then fired two shots in the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Fernandez did not heed the alleged
warning, accused-appellant fired towards Fernandez who fell, face downward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused-appellant denied that the reason for his taking Fernandez
out of jail was to help him find a bond for his release. He reported the
shooting incident to the Chief of Police upon the latter's arrival at the
municipal building from patrol duty, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5
 o'clock</st1:time> the same morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> convicted accused-appellant for
murder, which judgment of conviction is now before Us on appeal, with the
accused-appellant assigning the following errors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in -</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been repeatedly held that as a rule, the finding of the
trial court as to the credibility of witnesses is not to be disturbed on appeal
to the Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Witnesses <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> and <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span>
were two of eight detainees in jail when the accused-appellant came to awaken
Jose Fernandez, stating that he was already off-duty and that he would help
Fernandez secure the bail for his release.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said witnesses, specially <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span>, had no
motive at all to testi­fy falsely against the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the latter was actually on duty
from 8 in the morning of 3 March 1965 to 8 in the morning of the following day,
as shown in Exhibit "5-A", a certification of entries on the police
blotter on those dates<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
does not necessarily mean that what the witnesses heard was not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, as will be seen later, it
strengthens the prosecution's stand that Fernandez was taken out of jail to be
killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witnesses <span class="SpellE">Alican</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span> likewise quoted PC corporal <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span> and Judge Cruz as warning the inmates not to talk
about what happened, otherwise what befell Fernandez would also happen to
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only truth could have motivated
these persons in testifying against accused-appellant, who is a policeman, against
Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span> of the PC, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Petrola</span>,
another policeman, and even the municipal judge, Federico U. Cruz. Moreover,
neither Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span>, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Petrola</span>,
nor the muni­cipal Judge himself were presented to refute the aforesaid
testimony regarding the warning or threats, especially after witness <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span> pointed in court to Judge Cruz during the latter's
cross-examination of said witness, as one of those who made the threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be further noted that the
accused-appellant himself later threatened <span class="SpellE">Alican</span>
with a gun in a try to stop the latter from testifying regarding the death of
Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of this incident,
<span class="SpellE">Alican</span> filed a criminal complaint against the herein
accused-appellant with the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The caution or warning made by the accused to the <span class="SpellE">jailmates</span>
of Fernandez (not to reveal what they had heard or seen shows the guilt of the
appellant of the crime with which he is charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Even more important, there is no proof that the 3 shells allegedly found in the
plaza came from the carbine of this appellant, and the prisoners at the jail
heard only one shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is also stressed that the accused had no motive for deliberately
doing away with Fernandez, pointing out the fact that the deceased's wife and
accused-appellant are second cousins. It has been held that motive is
unessential to conviction in murder cases when there is no doubt as to the
identity of the culprit.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the absence, therefore, of showing that the trial court had
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and
substance that would have affected the result of the case, this Court is not
inclined to disturb the factual finding of the court <u>a quo</u> as to the
credibility of said witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant's claim that he shot Fernandez in the back because the
latter was running away and would not stop despite appellant's warning shouts
and shots is further belied by the autopsy data.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necropsy report (Exhibit "6")
states that the victim was shot from a distance of approximately twenty-two
feet, which tallies with appellant's own report to the Chief of Police (shortly
after the shooting) that he fired at Fernandez from a distance of six or seven
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This distance is so short that
appellant could not have had time to shout to Fernandez an order to halt nor
fire two warning shots in the air before firing the fatal bullet, as he claims
to have done, and explains the testimony of prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Alican</span> and <span class="SpellE">Erfelo</span> that they heard
only one shot fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, therefore, the shooting of Fernandez can in no way be considered
justified as done in the performance of lawful duty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused-appellant's version being discredited, there is no
alternative but to concur with the trial court finding that it has been proved
beyond reasonable doubt that the killing of Fernandez by ap­pellant was
attended by <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>, since the victim was
shot in the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, an
examination of the information reveals that <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>
is not charged therein; hence the <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>,
although proved, can only be considered as a generic (not qualifying)
circumstance aggravating the crime of homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Such aggravating circumstance, how­ever, is offset by the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, the appellant having voluntarily admitted
the killing to the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Mapandan</span>
shortly after the crime was committed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The proper penalty for homicide is <u>reclusion temporal</u>
(Revised Penal Code, Article 249), applicable in its medium degree in the
absence of other aggravating or mitigating circumstance (Article 64, No. 1,
Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Giving appellant
the benefit of the Indeterminate Sentence law (Act 4103, as amended by Act
4225), the proper imposable penalty is one with a minimum within the range of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> which is the penalty
immediately below <u>reclusion temporal</u>, and a maximum within the medium
degree of the latter penalty.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the conviction of the appellant for the slaying
of the late Jose Fernandez is affirmed; but the sentence imposed is modified by
imposing upon said appellant a minimum of ten (10) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
mayor</u> and a maximum of seventeen (17) years of <u>reclusion temporal</u>,
with the accessory penalties prescribed by law. The civil indemnity due to the

<p class="BODY">Let a copy of this decision be referred to the Secretary of
Justice for an inquiry into the pos­sible responsibility of Municipal Judge
Federico U. Cruz, who was originally indicted jointly with accused Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Guba</span>, but subsequently excluded from the charge by the
Provincial Fiscal on the patently ins insufficient ground of "lack of
interest" on the part of the victim's widow.</p>
