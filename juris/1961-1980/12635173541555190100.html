				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, in its Case No. 61831, dis­missing petitioner-appellant's suit for
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant had insured a cargo of materials for paint manufacture
shipped by <span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros. Company, Ltd. on board the SS
"Philippine Bear" of the United States Lines and consigned to
National Lead Co. (Phil.) Inc. of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Discharged at the latter port into the custody of the Bureau of Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service of the Philippine Republic, the cargo was
delivered with part of it missing or damaged by rain to the extent of P5<span class="GramE">,948.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As insurer,
appellant paid the damage and brought suit, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
of the consignee of the <span class="GramE">cargo</span>, to recover the amount
from the shipping company and the Republic as "<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>"
opera­tor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action was dismissed as aforesaid by Judge Jose N. <span class="SpellE">Leuterio</span>, on the grounds that the shipping company's
liability ended upon deli­very of the cargo to the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service and that the Republic was not <span class="SpellE">suable</span> for the
negligence of the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to this Court, the insurance company insists that the
Republic had shed its immunity from suit by engaging in non-­governmental
activities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
points raised by appellant were raised and squarely decided in Case G. R. No.
L-23139, Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. vs. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, prom­ulgated on 17 December 1966 (18 S. C. R. A. 1120), wherein this
Court ruled that <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations by the Bureau of
Customs were purely incidental to the governmental function of assessing and
col­lecting customs duties due on imported merchandise; that in engaging in
such necessary incidental activity the Government did not waive its immunity
from suit without its express consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since that de­cision down to our judgment in Phoenix Assurance Co. vs.
Republic of the Philippines, L-16531, rendered only last October (1969),the
Mobil doctrine has been consistently upheld and reaffirmed in over twenty
decisions of this Court. No adequate reason has been shown here to vary from
such well-established and uniform rulings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellants.</span></p>
