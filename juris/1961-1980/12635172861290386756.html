				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On July 13, 1965, a special civil action for certiorari and
prohibition was filed by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>, the widow, and <span class="SpellE">Lyda</span>,
Alicia and Olga <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>, the children of the deceased
<span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An order of respondent Judge Pedro C. Navarro
denied a motion to dismiss filed by the other respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>, who claimed to
be an illegitimate child of the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such
pending case for partition, inventory, accounting and delivery of share,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>,
as plaintiff, sought that after due hearing the defendant therein, now
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>, be ordered to
submit a true inventory of the conjugal properties; to submit an accounting of
the income of the conjugal properties as well as her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>
proper­ties from the time she took administration of the same by reason of the
sickness of the deceased; to submit a project of partition of the estate left
by the deceased and to deliver to plaintiff his legal share.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge denied the motion to dismiss filed by
petitioners before us on the ground that the suit before him was instituted
before the special proceeding for settlement and distribution of the estate
filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and that there was no <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another action, as
what was sought in his court was the inventory, account­ing and delivery of the
share as inheritance which respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span> claimed as his by virtue of his being an
illegitimate child of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">To show that there was either lack or excess of jurisdiction or
that there was grave abuse of discretion in the issuance of the challenged
order, petitioners before us would stress that the Court of First Instance of
Manila, wherein the intestate proceeding was instituted, had exclusive
jurisdiction of the settlement and distribution of the estate of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge ought to
have, in their opinion, dismissed the case then.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writ must be granted but not by virtue of such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in a decision rendered by us on August
22, 1968,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by Justice J. B. L. Reyes, it was held that the action
of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>
as an alleged illegitimate child, not natural, to secure a judicial
investigation and declaration of his paternity may not be instituted beyond the
time limits prescribed by Article 285 of the Civil Code which deals with the
compulsory acknow­ledgment of natural children.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth in the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Thus, to hold with the court below that an illegitimate child not
natural, already over 21 years of age at the death of its alleged parent, may
still <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the latter's legal heirs or
representatives to obtain a declaration that the deceased is his progenitor is
certainly to upset the carefully categorized scheme of rights ordained by the
Civil Code for the various classes of children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because such a holding would not only place the spurious child on a more
advantageous position <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the illegitimate but
natural child, but actually place him on an equal footing with legitimates,
whose paternity suits last as long as they live; and this advantage would be
granted to the illegitimates not natural children on no other basis than the
mere <u>silence</u> of the Code, when the right of legitimate sons an daughters
to file paternity suits despite the death of their progenitors had to be
expressly conferred by Article 268.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
our opinion, the ruling under appeal goes against the spirit, the system, and
the logic of the Civil Code."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of our decision
reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[In view of the foregoing],
the ruling of the Court of First Instance of Manila admitting evidence of the
paternity of the private respondent, over and against the objections of the
legal repre­sentative of the deceased alleged parent, is in grave abuse of
discretion, and is hereby set aside; hence, said respondent must be declared
without legal interest in the estate of the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the case are ordered remanded
to the court of origin for further proceedings conformably to this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">It being clear, therefore, that respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span> had been
judicially declared by us to be without legal interest in the estate of the
decedent, no useful purpose would be served by his pending action in the sale
of respondent Judge Navarro for partition, with inventory, accounting and
delivery of shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
order of respondent Judge refusing to dismiss such a case would clearly appear,
under the circumstances, to be devoid of any support in law and amount to a
grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of certiorari prayed for to set aside
such order denying the motion to dismiss as well as the writ of prohibition
prayed for to command respondent Judge from proceeding further in the aforesaid
Civil Case No. 8538 pending before him are granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against respondent Agustin <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> <span class="SpellE">Clemeña</span>.</p>
