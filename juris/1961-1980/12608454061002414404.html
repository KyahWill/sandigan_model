				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila dated August 17, 1955, 
in Civil Case No. 26993 for expropriation, the Republic of the Philippines 
acquired the property known as Fabie Estate situated in Paco, Manila, pursuant 
to the provisions of Republic Act No. 1162, providing "for the expropriation of 
landed estates or haciendas or lands which formed part thereof in the City of 
Manila, their subdivision into small lots, and the sale of such lots at costs or 
their lease on reasonable terms, and for other purposes".
<p>Thereafter, the Land Tenure Administration assumed administration of the 
Fabie Estate. A survey was made of the entire property indicating the list of 
the occupants and tenants thereof, and the improvements existing thereon (Exh. 
B). According to said survey, Lot 10, Block 41, was vacant and unoccupied. Even 
before the survey, however, the Administration had already posted notices in 
conspicuous places within the premises prohibiting unauthorized persons from 
entering the same. After the survey, the entire Estate was subdivided into small 
lots, not exceeding 150 square meters in area, for their eventual sale or lease 
to their <i>bona fide</i> tenants or occupants. For the reason, however, that 
streets had to be constructed within the Estate, and some portions thereof had 
to be taken as road lots, the lessees or occupants of those portions traversed 
by proposed streets had to be reallocated the unoccupied portions or lots within 
the Estate. One of those tenants was Perfecto Magaway, whose house was found to 
be within a road lot. Consequently, he was adjudicated Lot No. 10, Block 41, one 
of the vacant parcels within the Estate, and the agreement to sell in favor of 
Magaway was executed by the Administration on April 27, 1957 (Exhs. F and 
F-1).</p>
<p>Magaway, however, could not take possession of Lot No. 10, Block 41, because 
appellant Gorgonia Vda. de Caliwan had entered the same without the permission 
of the Administration and constructed thereon a makeshift house or 
"barong-barong". The Administration demanded of Caliwan to vacate the premises, 
but she refused. Whereupon, the Administration filed ejectment proceedings 
against her on January 20, 1958 in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil 
Case No. 34918), and on November 21, 1958, the court rendered judgment ordering 
Caliwan to vacate the lot in question. From this judgment, Caliwan appealed to 
the Court of Appeals, which certified the appeal to us because it raises only 
questions of law.</p>
<p>The sole issue here is the interpretation to be given to the word "occupant" 
as used in Republic Act No. 1162, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 3. The landed estates or haciendas expropriated by virtue of this Act 
shall be subdivided into small lots, none of which shall exceed one hundred and 
fifty square meters in area, to be sold at cost to the tenants, or 
<i>occupants</i>, of said lots, and to other individuals, in the order 
mentioned; * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is urged by appellant that assuming that she is not a possessor in good 
faith of the lot in question, the word "occupant" as above used should be 
construed to include those commonly known as "squatters", meaning individuals 
who, without necessarily employing violence, either physical or moral, and 
taking advantage of the absence or tolerance of land owners, succeed in 
occupying their properties for residential purposes; that under this 
interpretation, she, being an actual "occupant" of the lot in question is 
entitled to priority in its purchase over any other claimant who is neither a 
lessee or occupant thereof; and that while she concedes the right of Perfecto 
Magaway, who lost his landholding because it was included in a road lot, to be 
given another lot, Magaway can not, however, be given the lot that appellant is 
already occupying and has improved, but should be allocated another disposable 
lot within the Estate.</p>
<p>We can not subscribe to appellant's view that squatters should also be 
considered beneficiaries of Republic Act No. 1162.</p>
<p>In at least two occasions in the past, we have ruled that persons guilty of 
illegal entry can not invoke the benefits of Commonwealth Acts Nos. 20 and 529 
(providing for the expropriation by the government of large landed estates to be 
sold at cost to their <i>bona fide</i> tenants or occupants), the purpose of 
these laws being to aid and benefit lawful occupants and tenants or those 
endowed with legitimate tenure, by making their occupancy permanent and giving 
them an opportunity to become owners of their holdings. In short, these laws are 
not meant for the benefit of the lawless.</p>
<p>In Enriquez, et al. <i>vs</i>. Panlilio, et al., 95 Phil., 402; 50 Off. Gaz. 
(7) 3026 we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Commonwealth Act No. 538 [should be 539] contemplates the expropriation of 
lands lawfully occupied, where said occupancy is known and permitted by the 
owner under an agreement, express or implied, of tenancy, and where the tenants 
and occupants are observing the terms of the agreement by paying the rentals 
agreed upon or, a reasonable amount ascertained by the court for the use and 
occupation of the premises. The purpose of the law is to aid and benefit the 
lawful occupants and tenants, by making their occupancy permanent and giving 
them an opportunity to become owners of their holdings."</p></blockquote>
<p>while in Bernardo, et al. <i>vs</i>. Bernardo and C. A., 96 Phil., 202; 50 
Off. Gaz., (12) 5789 we stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In carrying out its special readjustment policies, the government could not 
simply lay aside moral standards, and aim to favor usurpers, squatters, and 
intruders, unmindful of the lawful or unlawful origin and character of their 
occupancy. Such a policy would perpetuate conflicts instead of attaining their 
just solution. It is safe to say that the term 'bona fide occupants' was not 
designed to cloak and protect violence, strategy, double dealing, or breach of 
trust."</p></blockquote>
<p>Being in <i>pari materia</i> with the above-mentioned Commonwealth Acts, 
except that it refers specifically to landed estates within the City of Manila, 
Republic Act No. 1162 should be given the same interpretation and application. 
The absence of the term "bona fide" in qualifying tenants and occupants in the 
Act is of no significance, for it must be understood that, unless the contrary 
appears, only those in good faith are intended. Indeed, the explanatory note to 
House Bill No. 930 (the source of the Act in question), as well as the entire 
record of the legislative deliberations on the proposed bill (Third Congress, 
Congressional Record, First Session, Vol. I, No. 36, pp. 967-993), discloses no 
intent on the part of the lawmakers to benefit squatters in passing House Bill 
No. 930, but that their purpose and intent appear to be to expropriate landed 
estates or haciendas within the City so that they may be subdivided into small 
residential lots and sold at cost on installment basis, or leased on reasonable 
terms, to their lawful tenants or occupants. Had Congress envisioned House Bill 
No. 930 to be a solution to the squatters' problem in the City of Manila, it 
would have clearly said so in the proposed bill or during the deliberations 
thereon. Upon the other hand, this Court can well take judicial notice of the 
fact that the government has tried and is still trying to meet the city's 
pressing squatters' problem, not by selling them their landholdings, but by 
relocating and transferring them to available public lands or government housing 
projects within the city or in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
appellant Gorgonia Vda. de Caliwan.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon, De Leon,</i> and <i>Natividad, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
