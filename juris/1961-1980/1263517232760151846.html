				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1968</st1:date>
petitioner Felipe de Guzman filed a petition to review the resolutions of the
Court of Appeals dated March 19 and June 25, both of the year 1968. The first
set aside the decision of said court of Septem­ber 6, 1967, and the second
affirmed the reversal of said decision and denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents named in the petition for review, aside from the
Court of Appeals, are the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Walfrido</span> de <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">los</span></span> Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>,
Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch
IV, Q.C., the Philippine Trust Company, Leo­nardo Geronimo, Maria <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Mariano, <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Ma­riano and the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Perpetuo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Mariano.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the petition that in Special Pro­ceedings No.
Q-573 "Intestate Estate of the Deceased Antonio Geronimo" of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, several parties
appeared claiming to be the nearest kin of said decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among them were respondent Leonardo Geronimo
and the respondents Mariano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
claimed to be a half-brother and the latter, relatives within the fifth degree
of said decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner herein
likewise appeared and asked for leave to intervene as claimant-creditor of the
estate in view of alleged cash advances secured from, him to be utilized solely
for the purpose of prosecuting the case against the forger of the will of the
decedent, claiming further in this connection that the efforts exerted by him
and the persons who claimed to be the heirs of the decedent resulted in the
conviction of the forger, this saving the estate from going into the latter's
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the original testate
pro­ceedings before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
were converted into <span class="GramE">intestate</span> proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="8">August
 26, 1961</st1:date> the probate court allowed petitioner to intervene in said
proceedings "it appearing that he has a legal interest in this case for
the protection of his rights".</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition also alleges that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued orders on January 30, April 5, April 24 and
July 5, 1966 which in effect disposed of the entire properties of the estate,
without the required publication of notices to the creditors of the estate,
without making any previous declaration of heirs, without satisfying the
obligations of the estate before ordering the distribution of its assets, and
other alleged irre­gularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To top
all these, said Court later denied petitioner's formal complaint for
intervention in its order of <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="8">August
 24, 1965</st1:date>, from which order petitioner appealed to the Court of
Appeals where the case was docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. 37061-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition alleges likewise that notwithstanding the appeal
mentioned above, the lower court issued on November 24, 1965 an order directing
execution of the basic orders complained of, as a result of Which peti­tioner
had to file special civil action in the same Court of Appeals (C.A.-G.R. No.
37306-R) to annul the orders of said Court in the aforesaid intestate
proceedings dated January 30, April 5, April 24 and July 5, 1965 together with
its subsequent orders for their implementa­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition further alleges that on <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1967</st1:date> the Court of Appeals
decided C.A.-G.R. No. 37306 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the questioned Orders of January 30, April 5,
April 24, 1965, July 5, 1965, August 25, 1965, September 29, 1965, and all
other subsequent orders issued for the implementation of the main orders
mentioned, are hereby set aside for being null and void; ordering the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span> who, evidently appeared to be excluded heirs of
the deceased Antonio Geronimo and therefore cannot be par­ties interested in
the estate of the decedent, to deliver all the properties that were delivered
to them by virtue of the questioned orders and to account for the proceeds and
rentals thereof to the Philippine Trust Com­pany which is, hereby directed to
take possession of the same and to render an inventory thereof; declaring said
properties reverted to the estate of the decedent; and directing the respondent
court to satisfy first the claim of herein petitioner against the estate of the
decedent before any distribution of the estate of the decedent is made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="3">March 19,
 1968</st1:date> the Court of Appeals reversed its decision of <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1967</st1:date>, which reversal was
subsequently affirmed by another resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These resolutions of the respondent Court of Appeals are the ones which
petitioner sought to have this Court review as stated at the outset.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review was given due course in our resolution of
August 13, 1968 and after service of the proper notices for the filing of
briefs, petitioner filed his on November 4, 1968 and respondents filed theirs
on February 22, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 7, 1969 petitioner, through counsel, and with conformity
of counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Marianos</span>, filed a plead­ing
entitled "MOTION TO APPROVE AMICABLE SETTLEMENT, ENJOIN THE PARTIES TO
COMPLY THEREWITH AND TO DISMISS", to which was attached the amicable
settlement mentioned therein, -executed on March 6, 1969 by petitioner Felipe
de Guzman, on the one hand, and by <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Mariano, the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Perpetuo</span>
