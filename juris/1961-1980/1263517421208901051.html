				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner Angel <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>, a sergeant
in the police force of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, with service in
the said police agency dat­ing back to <st1:date year="1939" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1939</st1:date>, applied for leave of absence on <st1:date year="1952" day="15" month="2">Februa­ry 15, 1952</st1:date>, which the respondent <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>, then mayor of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place>, granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This leave of absence was later extended, with the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo's</span> approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the very day that <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> went on leave, that is, on
February 16, 1952, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Calingan</span>, a non-eligible,
was appointed "<u>vice</u> Angel <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>, "
to serve "until your successor shall have been duly qualified, unless
sooner discharged by proper authority." When <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>
reported back for duty (after his leave had expired), he was told that his
position had been "abolished" by the municipal council, allegedly
pursuant to a directive (dated August 31, 1951) of the Secretary of Finance,
and that in its stead the posi­tion of corporal had been "created."
That <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> was, at the time adverted to, already a
civil service eligible, is conceded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> then filed a complaint with the
provincial board against the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>, but as
no action was forthcoming on his complaint, he elevated the matter to the
Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="3">March
 15, 1954</st1:date> to the respondent <span class="SpellE">Re­mo</span>,
Assistant Executive Secretary Enrique C. <span class="SpellE">Quema</span>
ordered the reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> refused,
prompting <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> to file this petition for
mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked the court to order <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> to reinstate him and to pay him P3,000 in moral
damages, P1,200 in actual damages, and P500 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1954</st1:date>,
while the case was pending, the then acting municipal mayor (Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Sarto</span>) of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place>
reinstated <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> then moved for dismissal
of the action, but the court denied his motion on the ground that there
remained un­decided the question of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1954</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> filed an amended petition in which he asked
that <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> be likewise ordered to pay his monthly
salary of P55 during all the time that he was out of the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day he filed a supplemental
petition charging that his reinstate­ment on <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1954</st1:date> was a sham as he was not given back his
badge and sidearm nor paid his salary, and asking for P5,000 as additional
moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1956</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> amended his petition again, this time to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, the
term of office of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> having then
expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1957</st1:date>
the lower court rendered judgment in favor of <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>,
but despite the inclusion of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:placename></st1:place> as
party respondent the lower court failed to make it respond in damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the lower court's de­cision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing considerations, judgment is
hereby rendered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) ordering the res­pondent,
<span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>, in his
capacity as May­or of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>, to pay the petitioner all
his salary from the time he was refused reinstatement to the police force of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in August 1952, until the time when he was reinstated
to his present posi­tion as Corporal in the Police Force of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>;
(b) or­dering the respondent, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>, to pay the petitioner the amount of P500.00 as
attorney's fees; and (c) ordering the respondent Mayor <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
to pay the costs of the suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Copies of the decision were received by the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Enci­so</span> on <st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="12">December
 3, 1957</st1:date> and by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> on <st1:date year="1957" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1957</st1:date>, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 18 the respondents <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> and <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
filed a notice of appeal and appeal bond, which the court received on December
26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, that is, on
December 24, the petitioner filed a motion asking that the munici­pality be
adjudged <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1958</st1:date>
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> granted the petitioner's motion and amended its
judgment to read thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The judgment in this case is hereby amended as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) ordering the respondents, Ex-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> and the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span> to pay jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> the salaries of the plaintiff-petitioner, Angel <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>, from the time when he was refused reinstatement in
the Police Force of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span> on August, 1952 until the
time when he was reinstated in his present position as Corporal of the Police
Force of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>; (b) ordering the respondents, Ex-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Deo­gracias</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span> and the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>,
to jointly and severally pay the petitioner, Angel <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>
the amount of P500.00 as moral damages and another amount of P500.00 as
attorney's fees and (c) ordering the respondents to pay the costs of the
suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter the court disapproved the respondents' appeal on the
ground that they had not filed a record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court took the view that the original
action for mandamus had been converted into an ordinary suit for damages as a
result of the reinstatement of the petitioner, and, consequently, while no
record on appeal is re­quired in an appeal in a special civil action, such
record is required in appeals in ordinary actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents disagreed with the lower
court and elevated the question to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We held that the action retained its character as a suit for mandamus
and therefore the respondents, as appellants, did not have to file a record on
ap­peal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We then ordered the lower court
to give due course to the res­pondents' appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence this appeal which, originally taken to the Court of Appeals, was by that
Court certified to this Court pursuant to section 31 of the Judiciary Act of
1948.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents contend (1) that the petitioner's position
(sergeant of police) in the police force of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span> had
been abolished; (2) that the lower court could no longer amend its decision so
as to make the respondent municipality <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liable with the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> because at the time
it did so the decision had already become final as to the petitioner; and (3)
that under the circums­tances, the respondents should not be condemned to pay
to the peti­tioner either damages or his salary during the period in question.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The respondents' claim that the position occupied by <span class="SpellE">Enci­so</span> had been abolished, is without basis in law and in
fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, except for the naked verbal assertion of the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>, there is absolutely nothing within
the four cor­ners of the record which supports this claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents' own documentary evidence,
more specifically exhibits 1, 1-A, 1-E and 1- C, upon which are spread the
minutes of the regular session of the <span class="SpellE">Goa</span> municipal
council held on May 31, 1952 and the text of resolution no. 48 approving the
municipal budget for the fiscal year 1952-1953, contain not the slightest
intimation of the abolition of the item corres­ponding to the position held by
the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>; upon the contra­ry, while
maintaining the salary of the position at P660 per annum, the budget merely
changed the rank from sergeant to corporal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act 554, relied upon by the respondents, and which went
into effect on June 17, 1950, amended section 2273 of the Re­vised
Administrative Code (as amended by Republic Act 160) to read, in its pertinent
portions, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 2273.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Salaries
of members of police force</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
salaries of the chief of police and other members of the police force shall be
fixed by the mu­nicipal council.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Except as otherwise specially provided, the annual salaries
of members of the police force shall not exceed the amounts <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>
fixed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In municipalities of the third class:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the chief of police, sixteen hundred and
eighty pesos; for the corporal, thirteen hundred and eighty pesos; and for
other members of the police force, thirteen hun­dred and twenty pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">What was plainly intended by the Act was
merely an increased adjust­ment of maximum rates of pay, as the change of
designation of rank had <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> been decreed by
Republic Act 160 which took effect as ear­ly as <st1:date year="1947" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec.
2273 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Rep. Act 160, reads, in
its pertinent portions, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2273.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Salaries
of members of police force</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
salaries of the chief of police and other members of the police force shall be
fixed by the mu­nicipal council.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Except as otherwise specially provided, the annual salaries of
members of the municipal police shall not exceed the amounts <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> fixed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In municipalities of the third class: for the chief of
police, one thousand two hundred and sixty pesos; for the corporal, nine hundred
and sixty pesos; and for other members of the police force, eight hundred and
forty pesos."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">So that since nothing in 'the record indicates that, during the
period in question, there was a corporal as well as a sergeant in the police
agency of <span class="SpellE">Goa</span>, it is clear that the position occupied
by <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>, although the given rank is that of
sergeant, was actually that of cor­poral, in line with the legislative policy
laid down in Republic Act 160.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
whimsically chose to retain in its an­nual budgetary resolutions the
designation of sergeant when it should have been corporal, the fault cannot be
ascribed to <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fine, although <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> erroneously called
himself a sergeant of police and every municipal budget of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place> prior to that for 1952-1953 compounded the
error by recognizing that rank, the fact remains that in law the item that he
occupied was that of corporal.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, as the Department of Finance, whose directive
dated <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1951</st1:date> was
cited as reason for the supposed abolition of the petitioner's position,
subsequently explained, there was no in­tention to abolish existing positions
and to create new ones but only to change the designation in order to conform
to the new legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in his 6th
<span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to the Executive Secretary, dated <st1:date year="1953" day="2" month="2">Feb­ruary 2, 1953</st1:date>, the then
Undersecretary of Finance <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> B. Ortiz, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, said:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>In requiring the change in designation as above-stated</u>,
<u>this Department</u> [in its letter dated <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1951</st1:date> to the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place>
municipal council] <u>did not intend the abo­lition of position of sergeant of
police</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It merely requir­ed that
the designation of the position be changed to cor­poral</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Neither did it intend to place the
incumbent of the old position out of the service specially so when he is,</u> <u>as
herein shown</u>, <u>a civil service eligible</u>." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, by reinstating the petitioner to the posi­tion
of corporal, the respondents in effect admitted that the position was the same
one he formerly held although it now bears a different name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reinstatement order of <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1954</st1:date> states:</p>

<blockquote>"Effective upon receipt of this letter you are here­by <u>reinstated
</u>to your position in the police department of this municipality, and by
virtue however of Republic Act 554 this will be a <u>reinstatement</u> to the
position of corporal, instead of sergeant." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the contention that there was no position to which
the petitioner could be restored as it had been abolished, is clearly
untenable.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The next argument of the respondents is that as the peti­tioner
received a copy of the decision on December 3, 1957 he had only up to December
18 of that year, or a period of 15 days, within which to ask for an amendment
of the decision, so that when the petitioner actually filed his motion on
December 24, the lower court had already lost jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim is premised on the assertion that
the petitioner's action for mandamus retained its character as such, contrary
to the lower court's ruling that it was in effect converted into an ordinary
action for damages upon the reinstatement of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, this ruling of the lower court was made on the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo's</span> motion to dismiss the case on the
ground of petitioner's reinstatement on <st1:date year="1954" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consistently with
this ruling, the court subsequently disapproved the respondents' ap­peal for
their failure to file a record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was the ruling until <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="4">April
 28, 1960</st1:date> when this Court's decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Remo</u></span><u>
v. <span class="SpellE">Palacio</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></u></span></a>
was promulgated, holding that the action for mandamus did not be­come an
ordinary action for damages upon the reinstatement of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the petitioner justifiably
relied upon the disputed ruling of the lower court and accordingly computed the
period of appeal at 30 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it may be noted that while under the former
Rules a period of only 15 days was allowed for appealing from deci­sions in
actions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>,
and employer's liability cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in contrast to the period of 30 days provided for appeals in ordinary actions,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
no such distinction appears in the present Rules.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead a uniform period of 30 days is now allowed for appeals in all actions.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The final issue to be resolved is whether under the cir­cumstances
the respondents should be made liable to the petitioner for back salaries and
moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although for this purpose we may assume as correct, it be­ing
factual, the lower court's finding of bad faith on the part of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> in refusing to reinstate the petitioner, we deem it
needful to explain briefly why we agree with the court's imputa­tion of bad
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have already explained, the
position of ser­geant of police was in fact never abolished by the municipal
coun­cil of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place> and that the
only change effected was the name-designa­tion of the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the petitioner therefore returned from
his leave, the excuse given by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
that the posi­tion had been abolished was patently false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of this, <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
obstinately refused to reinstate the petitioner, in defiance of the orders of
the Office of the President and in palpable disregard of the opinion of the
Secretary of Finance already adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And more, the impression is inescapable from a close reading of the
record that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> essentially refused
to reinstate the petitioner because of political differences, the principal one
being that the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> was a Liberal
appointed by a Libe­ral mayor and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
was a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the rule that when a public officer goes out­side
the scope of his duty, particularly when acting <span class="SpellE">tortiously</span>,
he is not entitled to protection on account of his office, but is liable for
his acts like any private individual.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"It is a general rule that an officer-executive,
administrative, quasi-judicial, ministerial, or other­wise who acts outside the
scope of his jurisdiction and without authorization of law may thereby render
himself amenable to personal liability in a civil suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he exceeds the power conferred on him by
law, he cannot shelter himself by the plea that he is a public agent acting
under color of his office, and not perso­nally.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the eye of the law, his acts then are wholly without authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of the Administrative Code govern­ing
municipalities like <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Goa</span></st1:place>
contain no <u>phraseology</u> that would nega­tive the liability of the
respondent municipal corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Busa­cay</u></span><u> v. Buenaventura</u>, 93 Phil. 786 (1953)
we strongly intimated that the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
had it been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the action, could have been
ordered to pay the back salaries of an employee who was illegally dismissed
from office.</p>

<p class="BODY">In point of fact this Court has in a number of cases reaf­firmed
the rule that municipal corporations may be held liable for the back pay or
wages of employees or laborers illegally se­parated from the service, including
those involving primarily governmental functions such as policemen.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The unlawful exclusion of the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Enciso</span> from
his position was to all intents and purposes, essentially equivalent to his
illegal separation from the service for the period in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court therefore correctly adjudged both respon­dents <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable to the petitioner for back salaries for
the period specified in the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to moral damages, however, we hold that the award of
back salaries already includes and absorbs this item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was our ruling in <u>Diaz v. <span class="SpellE">Amante</span></u>, 104 Phil. 968, and we see no reason to depart
from it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, with the elimination of the award of moral
damages, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is affirmed in all other respects, at
respondents' cost.</p>
