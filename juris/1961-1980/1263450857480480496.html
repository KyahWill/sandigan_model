				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A complaint for disbarment was filed by one Gil de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> against
Atty. Mario L. <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>, an assistant provincial
fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Narrat­ing <span style="">a </span>long story, complainant alleges
that respondent was guilty of fraud for having misappropriated the sum of
P4,200.00 out of a loan of P5,000.00 which the latter had obtained from the
Philippine National Bank after mortgaging a piece of land over which the com­plainant
claims ownership to the extent of 3/4 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer, denying some of the allegations in the complaint,
presents respondent's own version of the case, and claims that he committed no
wrong to complainant as the latter has no right to the land mortgaged to the
PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was referred to the Solicitor General for investigation
and said official has now submitted his report thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the late Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
who died on <st1:date year="1959" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1959</st1:date>,
had a parcel of land of about 21 hectares, situated in Barrera, <span class="SpellE">Lupi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camari­nes</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 27, which
was issued to him after he married his second wife, Elisa <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the death of Andres, and claiming to be
his only heir, Elisa <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rañola</span></span><span style=""> </span>executed an affidavit of summary
settlement of the estate of her husband and thereupon the title to the land was
issued in her name (T.C.T. No. 3053).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> sold the land to the respondent for P8<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> and the latter, in turn, secured title in his name
(T.C.T. No. 3289).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 27, 1960, the
complainant filed Civil Case No. 5087 with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cama­rines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> against <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> and the respondent, for parti­tion of the land
mentioned above, alleging that he was </span>the son of Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos by the latter's first wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Believing in the truth of this allegation,
the respondent entered into an "AGREEMENT" with the com­plainant (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B), pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That a certain Gil de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos claiming that he is the only heir of Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos with his first wife <span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span> de <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>, explained to me that he owns three-fourths (3/4) of
the land covered by TCT-3053 (originally OCT-27) of the land I bought from
Elisa <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> constituting his inheritance from his
late parents;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That believing that I
am the owner of only ONE-FOURTH (1/4) of said land, I offered to sell this
portion to Gil de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Gil de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> has
no money to buy one-fourth (1/4) portion and we have agreed:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">a.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That if I can secure from the
Development Bank of the Philip­pines an amount of ONE THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED
(P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>) PESOS or more by mortgaging the land sold
to me by Elisa <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> under TCT-3053, the amount of
EIGHT HUNDRED (P800.00) PESOS and expenses of the loan will be retained by the
undersigned and the remaining balance of the loan obtained will be delivered by
him (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bolaños</span>) to Gil de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos together with the sale of the entire 24.000 has. under TCT 3053,
executed by the undersigned in favor of the latter.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">b.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">That the consideration of the said
deed of sale in favor of Gil de Los Santos to be executed by the undersigned
will be the amount of the loan that was granted by the Bank to the undersigned
which will be assumed by Gil <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Santos."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">To
give effect to the agreement, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> and the respond­ent
had agreed to rescind the sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, and before
the respondent could apply for a loan with the DBP </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">agreed upon, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> discovered from a certain
document that the complainant was not a son of Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 2, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span>, together with a sister of Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos and the respondent, went to the office of
complainant's counsel, Atty. Abel Flores, and confronted complainant about his
paternity, in the presence of the latter's son, <span class="SpellE">Alejandre</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After consultations among the complainant, his son and his lawyer, the
complainant agreed to revoke the agreement above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This revocation is evidenced by </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">notation, in the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> dialect, at the left
margin of the document, which was translated in English at the foot thereof,
signed by the complainant and the respondent, and witnessed by complainant's
son, <span class="SpellE">Alejandre</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="2"><span style="">February
 9, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, Gil de <span class="SpellE">los</span> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> signed an acknowledgment that the property belongs to re­spondent and
that he is a </span>mere <span style="">tenant
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">was </span></span><span style="">attested to by <span class="SpellE">Alejandre</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and one Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon
complainant's petition to the court for the dismissal of the case for
partition, the same was dis­missed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
in view of the cancellation of the agree­ment, <span class="SpellE">Rañola's</span>
sale of the property to the respondent was no longer rescinded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Being the sole owner of
the land, the respondent mortgaged it to the Philippine National Bank for P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant
demanded on respondent to deliver to him the proceeds of the loan, less
P800.00, anchoring his claim on the rescinded agreement with the respondent,
and the latter having refused the demand, the instant complaint for disbarment
of the respondent was filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General
recommends the dismissal of the complaint, to which we are fully in accord, for
the reason that there is no sufficient ground to proceed against the respondent
inasmuch as the complainant has failed to substantiate the charges against the
respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainant claims that
respondent never intended to comply with the terms of their agreement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) <span class="GramE">and</span> only resorted to it as
a bait to bring about the dismissal of Civil Case 5087.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no proof in the record of any such
motive of deceit or fraud on the part of respond­ent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that when the respondent
recognized the complainant as the owner of 3/4 of the land, it was on the
belief, as represented by the complainant, that the latter was a son of Andres
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, which representation, however, turned
out to be false as proofs were found later on to belie the complainant's
pretense of his paternity with Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elisa <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span>
dis­covered from complainant's baptismal certificate that he was the son of
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span>, but not of Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> with his first wife, <span class="SpellE">Genoveva</span> de <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">No </span><span style="">less than a sister of the deceased confirmed
the fact that he was not a son of her brother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Arrayed with such proofs showing the falsity of his claim as a son of
Andres de <span class="SpellE">los</span> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, complainant voluntarily agreed to cancel
the agreement entered into by and between him and the respond­ent, and in a
memorandum handwritten by <span class="GramE">him,</span> he recognized the
respondent's ownership of the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There appearing to be no
sufficient ground to hold the respondent liable for unethical conduct as a
member of the legal profession, the case against him is hereby dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
