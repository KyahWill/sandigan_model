				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The present case comes by
direct appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Case No</span>. 44572) adjudging the
defendant-appellant, Luzon Stevedoring <span style="">Corporation,
</span>liable in damages <span style="">to the

Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the early afternoon of
</span><st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="8"><span style="">August 17, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">,
Barge L-1892, owned by the Luzon Stevedoring Corporation was being towed </span>down
the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>

causing <span style="">the bridge to list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The river, at the time, </span><span style="">was </span>swollen
<span style="">and the current swift, on account </span>of
the <span style="">heavy </span>down­pour in <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and the surrounding provinces on August 15
and 16, </span>1960.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sued by the Republic of
the Philippines for actual and con­</span>sequential <span style="">damage caused by its employees, amounting to P200,000 (Civil Case No.
44562, CFI of Manila), defendant Luzon Stevedor­</span>ing Corporation
disclaimed liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, on the grounds that <span style="">it had exercised due diligence in the
selection and supervision of its employees; that the damages to the bridge were
caused by <u>force</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>; that plaintiff has no capacity to sue; and
that the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> bailey bridge is an obstruction to
navigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due trial, the
court rendered judgment on June 11, 1963, holding the defendant liable for the
damage caused by its employee and ordering it to pay to plaintiff the actual
cost of the repair of the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> bailey bridge
which amounted to P192,561.72, with legal interest thereon from the date of the
filing of the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendant appealed
directly to this Court assigning the fol­lowing errors allegedly committed by
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>I - The lower court erred in not holding that the herein
defendant-appellant had exercised the diligence required of it in the selection
and supervision of its personnel to prevent damage or injury to others.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II - The lower court erred in not holding that the ramming of the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> bailey bridge by barge L-1892 was caused by <u>force</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>III - The lower court erred in not holding that the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> bailey bridge is an obstruction, if not a menace,
to navigation in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>
river.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IV - The lower court erred in not blaming the damage sustained by
the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> bailey bridge to the improper placement
of the dolphins.</blockquote>

<blockquote>V - The lower court erred in granting plaintiff's motion to adduce
further evidence in chief after it has rested its case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>VI - The lower court erred in finding the plain­tiff entitled to
the amount of P192,561.72 for damages which is clearly exorbitant and without
any factual basis.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, it must be
recalled that the established rule in this jurisdiction is that when a party
appeals directly to the Supreme Court, and submits his case there for decision,
he is deemed to have waived the right to dispute any finding of fact made by
the trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only questions that
may be raised are those of law (<span class="SpellE">Savellano</span> vs. Diaz, G.R.
No. L-17941, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">; <span class="SpellE">Aballe</span> vs. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santiago</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, G.R. No. L-16307, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">; G.S.I.S.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, G.R. No. L-22236, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="6"><span style="">June 22,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <span class="SpellE">converso</span>, a party
who resorts to the Court of </span>Appeals, and submits his case for decision
there, is barred from contending later that his claim was beyond the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason is that a contrary rule would encourage the undesirable practice of
appellants’ submitting their cases for decision to either court in expectation
of favorable judg­ment, but with intent of attacking its jurisdiction should
the decision be unfavorable (Tyson Tan et al. vs. Filipinas <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Seguros</span>) et al., G.R. No. L-10096, Res. on Motion
to Reconsider, <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1966</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, we are limited in this appeal
to the issues of law <span style="">raised in the
appellant’s brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Taking the aforesaid
rules into account, it can be seen that only <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
issues in this appeal are reduced to two:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1) Whether nor not the <span class="SpellE">collission</span> of
appellant's barge with the supports or piers of the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span>
bridge was in law caused by fortuitous event or <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>, and</p>

<p class="NUM">2) Whether or not it was error for the Courts to have permitted
the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to introduce additional
evidence of damages after said party had rested its case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the first question
considering that the <span class="SpellE">Nagtahan</span> bridge was an immovable
and stationary object and <span class="SpellE">uncontrovertedly</span> provided
with adequate openings for the passage of water craft, including barges like of
appellant's</span>, <span style="">it is undeniable
that the unusual event that </span>the b<span style="">arge,
exclusively controlled by appellant, rammed the bridge supports </span>raises a
presumption of negligence on the part of appellant or its employees manning the
barge or the tugs that towed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in
the ordinary<span style=""> course</span> of events,
such a thing does not happen if proper care is used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Anglo American Jurisprudence, the
inference <span style="">arises by</span> what is <span style="">known as the "<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u>ipsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>loquitur</u></span>"
<span style="">rule (Scott vs. London Docks Co., 2 H
&amp; C 596; San Juan Light &amp; Transit Co. </span>vs. <span class="SpellE">Reguena</span><span style="">, 224 U.S. 89, 56 L. Ed., 680; Whitewall </span>vs.
<span style="">Wolf, 127 Minn. 529, 149 N. W. 299; <span class="SpellE">Bryne</span> vs. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., 269 Mass.
130; 168 N.E. 540; <span class="SpellE">Gribsby</span> vs. Smith, 146 S.W. 2d
719).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant strongly
stresses the precautions taken by it on the day in question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that it assigned two of its most powerful
tugboats to tow down river its barge L-1892; that it assigned to the task the
more competent and experienced among its <u>patrons,</u> had the towlines,
engines and equipment double-checked and inspected; that it instructed its <u>patrons</u>
to take extra precautions; and concludes that it had done all it was called to
do, and that </span>the accident, therefore, should be held due to <u>force</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span> or fortuitous event.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These very precautions,
however, completely destroy the appellant's defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <span class="SpellE"><u>caso</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>fortuito</u></span> or <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>
(which in law are identical in so far as they exempt an obligor from liability)</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> by definition, are extraordinary events not <span class="SpellE">forseeable</span> or avoidable, </span><span style="">"events </span><span style="">that <u>could</u>
<u>not</u> be foreseen, or which, though foreseen, were inevitable" (Art.
1174, <span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Code of the Philippines).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, not enough that the event
should not have been fore­seen or anticipated, as is commonly believed but it
must be one impossible to foresee or to avoid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere <u>difficulty</u> to foresee the happening is not impossibility
to foresee the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"un <span class="SpellE">hecho</span> no <span class="SpellE">constituye</span> <span class="SpellE">caso</span> <span class="SpellE">fortuito</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span>

that the pos­sibility of danger was not only foreseeable, but actually
foreseen, and was not <span class="SpellE"><u>caso</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>fortuito</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Otherwise stated, the
appellant, Luzon Stevedoring Corpora­tion, knowing </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">appreciating the perils posed by the swollen stream and its swift
current, voluntarily entered </span><span style="">into
a situation in­</span><span style="">volving obvious
danger; it therefore assumed the risk, and can not shed responsibility </span><span style="">merely </span><span style="">because the precautions it adopted turned </span><span style="">out to be insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the lower C</span><span style="">ourt committed no error in holding it negligent
in not suspending o</span><span style="">perations </span><span style="">and in holding it liable for the damages
caused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It avails the </span><span style="">appellant naught to argue that the dolphins,
like the bridge, were improperly located.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if true, these circums­tances would merely emphasize the need of even
higher degree of care on appellant's part in the situation </span><span style="">involved </span><span style="">in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant, whose barges and tugs travel up and down the river everyday, could
not safely ignore the danger posed by these allegedly improper constructions
that had been erected and, in place, for years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the second point:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>appellant charges the lower court with having
abused its discretion in the admission of plaintiff's additional evidence after
the latter had rested its case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
an insinua­</span><span style="">tion that the delay
was deliberate to enable the manipulation of evi­dence to prejudice
defendant-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We <span style="">find no merit in the
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not further
evidence will be allowed after a party offering the </span><span style="">evidence has </span><span style="">rested </span><span style="">his case, lies </span><span style="">within the sound discretion of the trial
Judge, and this discretion will not be reviewed except in clear case of </span><span style="">abuse.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, no abuse of that discretion is shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was allowed to be introduced, after
plaintiff had rested its evidence in chief, were vouchers and papers to support
an item of P1,558.00 allegedly spent for the reinforcement of the panel of the
bailey bridge, and which item already appeared in Exhibit GG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, in fact, has no reason to charge
the trial court of being unfair, because it was also able to secure, upon
written motion, a similar order dated November 24, 1962, allowing reception of
additional evidence for<span style=""> </span>the said defendant-appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>
