				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An original action of certiorari to annul the lower court's
questioned order requiring petitioner to surrender three certificates of title,
notwithstanding his assertion of his right of an attorney's retaining lien over
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, for a considerable period of time, was the counsel
for Angela <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> de Perez in several court
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal cases so handled
successfully by petitioner for Angela were the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 34626 of the Court of First Instance of Manila
filed against Angela by herein respondents Antonio M. Perez and <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> Perez y <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, her
husband and son, res­pectively, asking principally that Angela be placed under
guardianship because of her alleged prodigality and that a suitable person be
appointed to administer her properties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1958</st1:date>, the
parties submitted to the said court a compromise agreement, of the same date,
which shortly afterwards was de­nounced by Angela.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1958</st1:date>, without passing on the validity of the compromise
agreement, the said court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Case G. R. No. L-14874 was the appeal to the Supreme Court taken
by respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> from the court of first
instance's dismissal of their action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court in its decision handed down on <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1960</st1:date>, affirmed the dismissal, holding that
jurisdiction properly pertained to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of
Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Special Proceedings No. 03123 of the domestic court of Manila was
then filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1960</st1:date>
by respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>, whose objective was limited
to seeking the said court's approval of the above compromise agreement
submitted on <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1958</st1:date> to
the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion on behalf of Angela, the domestic
relations court dismissed the proceeding on the ground of lack of jurisdiction
over the subject matter, holding that "(T)he compromise agreement herein
sought to be approved was allegedly entered into during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of Civil Case No. 34626 of the Court of First Instance of Manila presumably to
settle it amicably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the said case
was dismissed by that Court for lack of jurisdiction, and as its decision was
affirmed by the Supreme Court, there was no more case to be settled by
compromise because the three causes of action involved therein had not been <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> in this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">G. R. No. L-19711, the appeal to the Supreme Court taken in turn
by respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> from the domestic court's
dismissal of their second action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner asserts and it is not disputed, that sometime in
November, 1966, Angela, acting through a new attorney-in-fact in the person of
her daughter, Angela Perez y <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> de Staley,
terminated his services as counsel without just and lawful cause and without
paying him for his professional services, for which he presented his bill in
due course, as well as asserted his retaining lien over the three titles
entrusted to him by Angela in the course of his professional employment, in his
letter of February 16, 1967 to respondents' counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After petitioner's discharge as counsel, developments ensued
which gave rise to the present action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Case No. L-19711, the pending appeal from the domestic court's order
of dismissal of respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>' action, the very
same compromise agreement of <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="5">May 2,
 1958</st1:date> was submitted anew to this Court which approved the same in
its Resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1966</st1:date>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“In L-19711 (Antonio M. Perez, et al. vs. Angela <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> de Perez), the appearance of A. <span class="SpellE">Pison</span>,
Jr. as counsel for respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in
substitution of Attys. C. S. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> &amp; Associates
and Atty. Armando V. <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span>, is NOTED; and considering
the motion filed by respondent Angela <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> de Perez
by and through her daughter and attorney-in-fact Angela Perez y <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> de Staley and assisted by new counsel for said
respondent, manifesting (1) that said daughter is her duly authorized
attorney-in-fact; (2) that said respondent now confirms the compromise
agreement entered into by her husband and her son on May 2, 1958, copy of which
is attached to the motion as Annex 'B'; and (3) that said respondent affirms
that this compromise agreement was right and proper, THE COURT RESOLVED to
approve said compromise agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the said compromise agreement,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Angela <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, ceded in full
ownership to her son, respondent <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> Perez, the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila property covered by T. C. T. No. 34769 and
to her husband, respondent Antonio M. Perez, seven other properties<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
all situated in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila covered by seven
separ­ate titles, among them, T. C. T. Nos. 24927 and 24928 -- which three
titles are the ones involved herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angela likewise agreed to pay her husband the sum of P63,000.00 in full
settlement of his claim for damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
turn, respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>, (with Antonio signing on
behalf of his son <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> as guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span>) renounced any and all claims against Angela and
acknowledged that "defendant (Angela) owns in full ownership the interests
and properties presently in her name in J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
and Co. and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc., acknowledge that
she is fully entitled to administer and/or encumber and/or alienate the said
interests and properties as well as such other properties that she may acquire
with the proceeds of the sale, exchange or encumbrance of the same."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>, having
failed to obtain from petitioner the three titles to the properties ceded to
them as above stated in the compromise agreement, as petitioner asserted his
retaining lien over them, filed on February 22, 1967 with respondent domestic
court a so-called motion for partial execution disputing petitioner's asserted
lien of retention and asking the court to order petitioner to surrender the
three titles to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Overruling petitioner's opposition asking the court to respect
his right to retain the titles until the value of the professional services
rendered by him to Angela shall have been paid in full by the latter,
respondent court ordered under date of March 8, 1967 petitioner to surrender
the titles to respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> within five days
from notice, holding that "(A) s the Compromise Agreement has already been
approved, it is believed that the Court can have it enforced and, in connection
therewith, can compel Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span> to deliver the
owners duplicates of T. C. T. 's Nos. 24927, 24928 and 34769 to the <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Any attorney's lien in favor
of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ampil</span>, as attorney of <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
should be enforced against his client, and not against the <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner thereupon, sought the present recourse and the Court
in a resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1967</st1:date>
issued a writ of preli­minary injunction against the enforcement of respondent
court's questioned order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
urges that respondent court acted with grave abuse of discretion in having
granted the motion to surrender the titles in his possession, notwithstanding
the provisions of the first part of Rule 138, section 37 of the Rules of Court,
ex­pressly recognizing his right of retaining lien:</p>

<blockquote>'SEC. 37.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Attorneys'
liens</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- An attorney shall have a
lien upon the funds, documents and papers of his client which have lawfully
come into his possession and may retain the same until his lawful fees and disbursements
have been paid, and may apply such funds to the satisfaction thereof. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner must prevail.</p>

<blockquote>1. Full recognition of an attorney's retaining lien, present the
elements of lawyer-client relationship, lawful possession of the client's
funds, documents and papers and unsatisfied claim for attorney's fees, has
invariably been extended by the Court in view of the categorical terms of the
cited Rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the latest case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Matute</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court again emphasized, speaking through Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, that a
counsel's right to retain <span class="SpellE">muniments</span> of title in his
possession until payment of his lawful fees and disbursements is effected
incontestable, and under the rule and section aforesaid, the attorney can not
be compelled to surrender the <span class="SpellE">muniments</span> of title
mentioned without prior proof that his fees have been duly satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts, in the exercise of their
supervisory authority over attorneys as officers of the court, are bound to
respect and protect the attorneys' lien as a necessary means to preserve the
decorum and respectability of the profession."</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The Court cited therein the late Justice Laurel's opinion in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rustia</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abeto</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
with regard to the inconven­ience that may accrue to the client, and to the
client's adversary for that matter as in the case at bar, because of the
retaining lien thus exercised by an attorney, that such inconvenience "is
the reason and essence of the lien.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"But as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rustia</u></span>, we pointed out
that "if it be entirely indispensable for the court to gain possession of
the documents that have come to the attorney and are held by him in the course
of his employment as counsel, it can require the surrender thereof by requiring
the client or claimant to first file proper and adequate security for the
lawyers' compensation."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This alternative was in fact availed of by respondent Antonio M. Perez, who,
upon motion filed on August 10, 1967 alleging that "the properties in
question awarded to Antonio Perez have a market value of easily a quarter of a
million pesos and the property awarded to <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
Perez easily has an equal value", secured from the Court its resolution of
October 13, 1967 lifting the preliminary injunction as to Titles Nos. 24927 and
24928 of Manila upon his filing and the approval of a bond in the sum of
P25,000.00 answerable for whatever damages may be suffered by petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. It should be under scored that the retaining lien of an attorney
is only a passive right, and cannot be actively enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It amounts to a mere right to retain the
documents and papers as against the client, until the attorney is fully paid,
the exception being that funds of the client in the attorney's possession may
be applied to the satisfaction of his fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An attorney's retaining or <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> lien is
distinguished from his charging or special lien, which is an attorney's
specific lien for compensation on the fund or judgment, which he has recovered
by means of his professional services for his client in a particular case and
is provided in the second part of Rule 138, section 37.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Such charging lien covers only the services rendered by an attorney in the
action in which the judgment was obtained and takes effect under the cited rule
after the attorney shall have caused a statement of his claim of such lien to
be entered upon the records of the particular action with written notice
thereof to his client and to the adverse party it presupposes that the attorney
has secured a favorable money judgment for his client and grants the attorney
"the same right and power over such judgments and executions as his client
would have to enforce his lien and secure the payment of his just fees and
disbursements." On the, other hand, the attorney's retaining lien is a
general lien for the balance of the account between the attorney and his
client, and applies to the documents and funds of the client which may come
into the attorney's possession in the course of his employ­ment.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The attorney's retaining lien attaches to the, client's documents and funds in
the attorney's possession regardless of the outcome, favorable or adverse, of
any cases he may have handled for his client.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Called upon at all times to exert utmost zeal with unstinted fidelity in
upholding his client's cause and subject to appropriate disciplinary action if
he should fail to live up to such exacting standard, the attorney in return is
given the assurance through his liens -- retaining and charging -- that
collection of his lawful fees and disbursements is not rendered difficult, if
not altogether thwarted, by an unappreciative client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is thereby given an effective hold on his
client to assure payment of his services in keeping with his dignity as an
officer of the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. The fact that the client Angela, in the compromise agreement,
undertook to transfer her properties covered by the titles in question to
respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span> would not defeat petitioner's
retaining lien over the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's position is similar to that of a creditor who holds an
attachment lien over the properties, and the client-debtor must discharge the
lien before he can dispose the properties to a third person free of such
lien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In enforcing his retaining lien
over the titles, petitioner was enforcing the same against Angela as his former
client who was admittedly the owner of the properties and not against her
adversaries to whom the client had undertaken to transfer the same under the
compromise agreement, without first discharging the attorney's lien by payment
of the fees due to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
obviously was lost sight of by respondent court in ruling that petitioner's
lien "should be enforced against his client and not against the <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>" was that petitioner obtained possession of
the titles when they did appertain to his then client, Angela.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of that time, petitioner's retaining lien
was fastened to the titles and respondent court was bound to respect and protect
the same.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The situation would be different where title to the property is
the very subject in dispute in the case and the court adjudges the client's
adversary to be rightfully entitled thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such a case, the titles to the property could not be said to be
properties of the client, over which the attorney may claim a retaining lien. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The attorney may enforce his lien only over
properties of his client and not against those of his client's adversary.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
And the adversary's right as prevailing party to enforce the judgment for the
property adjudged to him should not depend on or be prejudiced by the client's
ability or refusal to pay the attorney.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court, however, has seen no need to make any pronouncement on such a
hypothetical situation that is not involved in the issues of the present case.</p>

<blockquote>1. The fact that the properties involved were exclusively <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties of Angela is undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is ad­mitted in respondents' very
petition in the proceedings below, (Annex A, petition) where they alleged that
Angela was squander­ing and liquidating her properties for the benefit of a
third party with whom she had fallen in love and that the fruits of these pro­perties
belong to her conjugal partnership of gains with respon­dent Antonio M. Perez
and are the main source of income of said partnership.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. It is error for respondents to contend that petitioner has no
right to assert a lien over <u>properties</u> that no longer belong to his
client Angela but to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of
the transfers as seemingly agreed to by Angela in November, 1966, after petitioner's
discharge as counsel, the properties thenceforth may be deemed to have been
validly transferred to respondents, as stipulated by the contracting
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And petitioner is in no way interfering
with their taking possession of the <u>properties</u> so transferred to them
nor with their enjoyment of the fruits thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that petitioner asserts and exercises is his passive lien of retaining
the <span class="SpellE">muniments</span> of title thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such retention impedes the corresponding
registration and transfer of the titles to respondents, it is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But rather than enforcing execution of the
compromise agreement against petitioner, who is in no way respondents'
adversary and disregarding petitioner's valid retaining lien, respondent court
is vested with due authority to enforce the same against Angela as the actual
adverse party in interest, by requiring her to produce the titles to effect
registration of the covenanted transfers and thereby compelling her to satisfy
petitioner's just fees or to file proper and adequate security for their
payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
<u>supra</u>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Respondents' argument that the compromise agreement was executed
since May 2, 1958, over eight years before petitioner's discharge as Angela's
counsel and that petitioner as Angela's counsel pursued interests adverse to
them and "sought to obtain the discharge of the compromise agreement"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
(which, in fact, petitioner successfully blocked until his discharge as
counsel) -- implying thereby that petitioner should be held bound by said
compromise agreement -- does not change the legal picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered that the said
compromise agreement was executed by one Roberto Della Rosa as Angela's
attorney-in-fact to settle Civil Case 34626 in the Manila court of first
instance;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
that one of Angela's grounds in denouncing the same was that it was not freely
or validly entered into by her representative;<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and that this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Reyes, rejected respondents'
contention that the Manila court should have held that Angela was in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, by the execution and submittal of the compromise
agreement, to question the jurisdiction of said court.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, when the same compromise agreement was sought to be
submitted by respondents in the proceedings below for the limited objective of
seeking respondent court's approval thereof, said court dismissed the
proceedings on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter,
since Civil Case No. 34626 of the Manila court which was presumably to be
settled amicably by the compromise agreement was dismissed by final decision of
that court as affirmed by this Court and "there was no more case to be
settled by compromise." (<u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The only question then appealed to this Court in the second case,
No. 19711, was the correctness of respondent court's order of dismissal; if the
same was set aside, the case would be remanded to respondent court for trial
and hearing on the myriad built-in issues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When pending said appeal and after petitioner's discharge, the same
compromise agreement (of dismissed Civil Case No. 34626) was submitted <u>anew</u>
in <u>November</u>, <u>1966</u>, to this Court by her <u>new</u>
attorney-in-fact, assisted by <u>new</u> counsel, manifesting <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that Angela "<u>now</u> confirms the
(said) compromise agreement", the picture that clearly emerges is that in
legal contemplation, Angela and respondents <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>
had <u>then</u> executed a <u>new</u> <u>agreement</u> for the transfer of her
said properties to respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The transfer of said properties to respondents could in no way be
deemed to retroact to over 8 years back on May 2, 1958, when the compromise agreement
was <u>originally</u> executed, presumably to settle Case No. 34626 which was
eventually dismissed in 1960 for lack of jurisdiction of the Manila court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer of the said properties as
provided in the compromise agreement as <u>now</u> confirmed in <u>November,
1966</u> by Angela and approved by this Court in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1966</st1:date> was effective only
as of his much later date.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question, then, that these properties were <u>exclusively</u>
Angela's prior to <u>November, 1966</u> and that respondents could lay no claim
thereto by virtue of the transfers pro­vided in the compromise agreement until
after its confirmation by Angela and approval in <u>November, 1966</u>; and
that respondents' contention that petitioner could not exercise his retaining
lien over the titles which had properly come into his possession during his
engagement as Angela's counsel long before November, 1966 is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even respondent court so understood it correctly, when in its
questioned order, it related that "(T)he case has been returned to this
Court with a resolution of the appellate tribunal approving the Compromise
Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is now the law of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is as if, after the petition
herein had been filed, this Court, acceding to the prayer of the <span class="SpellE">Perezes</span>, had by final order adjudged <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
to be an incompetent, had decided to dispense with the appointment of a
guardian by directly assuming the functions of one, and lastly had approved the
Compromise Agreement on behalf of the ward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Questions of procedural propriety, or of jurisdiction, are no longer
open because of the final action taken in the premises by the highest tribunal
