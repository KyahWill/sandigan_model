was challenged in an ordinary action before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Lim,
Sr., now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The burden of showing a grave abuse of discretion that plaintiff had to
bear, heavy enough as it was, was not made any lighter by the fact that such
revocation was expressly affirmed by the then Executive Secretary acting by
authority of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
plaintiff prevailed, the lower court relying on his plea that such an actuation
was marred by a failure to observe the commands of due process as well as the
non-impairment of obligations of contract guarantees of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was elevated to us on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a careful study of the relevant facts
and the controlling doctrines, we have reached a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the lower court decision: "The facts in the
present case are not disputed by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court is asked decide purely questions of law on the basis of the
facts appearing in three documents, namely, (a) 'Partial Stipulation of Facts'
dated October 6, 1964; (b) Additional Stipulation of Facts dated May 24, 1965;
and (c) 'Manifestation of Errata' dated July 7, 1965."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a document notarized on August 5, 1958, the then Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, on behalf of the Government as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and a certain Benito <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>,
who intervened in this suit as lessee, executed a lease contract covering sugar
plant marketing allotments of the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Mill
District for five consecutive crop years from and including the 1958 and 1959
season at a yearly rental at the rate of fifty centavos per <span class="SpellE">picul</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
After barely three months, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Lim,
Sr. took steps to lease the same sugar plant marketing allocations for a period
of ten crop years beginning with the 1963-1964 season at a yearly rental of
fifty-five centavos per <span class="SpellE">picul</span>, as shown in a first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Director of Lands to the then Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, enclosing communications from the
plaintiff dated November 6, 1958; February 9, 1959; and August 3, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, one year and one month later, on
December 8, 1959, with the existing five-year lease contract in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> having four more
years to run, another contract of lease for the same sugar plant marketing
allotments was executed by the then Acting Secretary of Agri­culture and
Natural Resources and plaintiff, the rate of rental being fixed at fifty-five
centavos per <span class="SpellE">picul</span> and the term to extend to the
1972-1973 crop year beginning from the 1963-1964 season.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came, on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="7">July 5,
 1961</st1:date>, the order of revocation by the then Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, Cesar M. <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the conclusion arrived at "that
the execution of the contract of lease between the then Acting Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
Lim, Sr. covering matters still embraced in a subsisting contract was improper,
irregular and arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is improper
and irregular because the contract was executed barely a year after the lease
contract with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> which calls for a period of
five crop years was entered into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the contract in question was executed, the contract with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> has four more years to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, it was, therefore, too premature
to even consider any application or request to lease the sugar plant marketing
allotments which were still covered by the subsisting contract of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
arbitrary because Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> was not accorded the
opportunity to be heard on the allegations that practically describes him to be
an unqualified lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do
not show that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> was notified to the effect
that after the expiration of his contract, the sugar plant marketing allotments
covered thereby were to be leased to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>
Lim, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings appear to have
been all taken without the knowledge of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the acceptance by the Bureau of Lands under
Official Receipt No. B-4076582 dated November 3, 1959 of the amount of
P5,785.35 tendered by Mr. Lim, Sr. to cover one crop year rental in advance - a
sum paid one month before the then Acting Secretary had approved the contract
-appears to show that everything was possibly being done in a railroaded manner
under very suspicious circumstances."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of such
revocation reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"In
view of the foregoing circumstances, this Office is left with no other choice
than to revoke, as it does hereby revoke, the contract of lease entered into by
this Department with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> Lim, Sr., on
December 8, 1959, covering the sugar plant marketing allotments for Plantations
Nos. 30-4, 30-8c and 30-9c of the <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> Mill
District, directing at the same time the refund to Mr. Lim, Sr. of all the
amounts already paid by him by way of advance rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the request herein of Mr. Benito <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> for the renewal of his contract may be given due
course in accordance with law and the rules and regulations govern­ing the
matter."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was a motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff on
August 9, 1961 premised on the procedural ground that he was not given the
opportunity to be heard before such revocation and on the substantive ground
that the lease contract of which he was a party was valid, subsisting and
binding, the power to revoke the same being lodged exclusively in a court of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The points thus raised were
further elaborated in a memorandum of <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="8">August
 18, 1961</st1:date> submitted to the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
His objections were carefully considered by such official who, in a
communication to plaintiff of <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="9">September
 12, 1961</st1:date>, reiterated his finding that such lease contract with the
plaintiff was "improper, irregular, arbitrary and executed under
suspicious circumstances." That the rights of plaintiffs were not
summarily disregarded by such revocation was made evident in the concluding
paragraph of that communication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:
"Hence, the decision of this Office in its 2nd <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1961</st1:date> to the
Director of Lands shall stand and remain in full force and effect with your
request for reconsideration hereby rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is, however, without prejudice to your right to file a new
application for the aforesaid sugar plant marketing allotments, if you so
desire, to be taken into consideration along with the application for renewal
of Benito <span class="SpellE">Roces</span> and such other applications as may be
filed by other interested applicants."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was a second motion for reconsideration with the grounds
alleged being insisted on anew, under date of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1961</st1:date>, the matter being extensively discussed
in a detailed communication of forty-three pages.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
With the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources standing firm in
his decision, the question was next submitted on appeal to the President of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The then Executive Secretary, the late <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>, acting by authority of the President, on August
8, 1963, informed plaintiff of his <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the
decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the previous
administration "revoking the lease contract executed in your favor and
directing the Director of Lands to reimburse you the amount already paid as
advance rental as well as the denial of your subsequent requests for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, your
appeal is dismissed for lack of merit."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next step was the court action with plaintiff as previously
indicated obtaining a favorable judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is before us on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was
set forth at the opening of this decision, we cannot uphold the decision of the
lower court.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The role incumbent upon
the judiciary in the appraisal of any administrative action, especially so of a
department secretary; has been delineated in our previous decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stressed by Justice Barrera in <span class="SpellE">Pajo</span> v. Ago:<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
"It is a well-recognized principle that purely administrative and
discretionary functions may not be interfered with by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In general, courts have no supervising power
over the proceedings and actions of the administrative departments of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is generally true with
respect to acts involving the exercise of judgment or discretion, and findings
of fact."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is only when there is a grave abuse of discretion which is
equivalent to a "capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment" or
"where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason
of passion, prejudice or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of positive
duty, or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined, or to act at all in
contemplation of law" that, as pointed out by Justice Barrera, there is a
justification for the courts setting aside the adminis­trative determination
reached.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such a principle was reiterated in almost identical language in a
recent decision penned by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus: "The Director based his decision on the evidence thus presented he
clearly acted within his jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If he had erred in appraising the evidence, the error is one of
judgment, but not an act of grave abuse of discretion annullable by writ of <i style="">certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is grave abuse of discretion only when
there is capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack
of jurisdiction, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic
manner by reason of passion, prejudice or personal hostility amounting to an
evasion of positive duty, or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined,
or to act at all in contemplation of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even the most cursory reading of the exhibits offered by the
parties in this case would fail to yield the conclusion that the actuation of
defendant Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources complained of could be
stigmatized as in any wise indicative of a public official giving vent to his
personal preferences and predilections motivated by passion, prejudice or
personal hostility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, what is
clearly revealed was the effort earnestly and sincerely made to appraise with
judicious objectivity the rights of the parties but with particular emphasis,
as should be the case, on what public welfare demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In no other way, could the exacting standard
implicit in the concept that a public office is a public trust be met.</p>

<p class="BODY">While not exactly in point, the thought expressed by the then
Justice, later Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> in <span class="SpellE">Ladrera</span> v. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
as to the responsi­bility incumbent on the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources in guarding the patrimony of the nation, commends itself for
relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Now, then,
because the Secretary has elected to abide by the law expressly requiring the
lot to be sold to the highest bidder; and because he refused to sanction what
otherwise would inflict a loss of P9,300.00 to the Government; will the courts
declare said official to have abused his discretion, and to compel him to sell
the lot at P50.00 per hectare? No, indeed that would be requiring him to donate
the land, and to squander public money or property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is authorized to <u>sell</u>; he is not
authorized to <u>donate</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowingly
to 'sell' public property at one twentieth of its price is not selling; it is
'donating', and the court will, if called upon to do so, declare such 'sale' to
be invalid, because the officer, in 'donating', has exceeded his power to
'sell'."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Necessarily then, with the paramount consideration given to public interest,
contracts with government officials are to be scrutinized with care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not sufficiently mindful of the Common
weal, they could rightfully be considered as suffering from congenital
infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parties dealing with the
government are pit on notice that the scope of discretion allowed public
officials as guardians of the community welfare is not unbounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its exercise in the ultimate analysis is
always subject to the test of conformity with the public good.</p>

<p class="BODY">The totality of the circumstances disclosed in the present
litigation is incompatible with any other assumption except that of a
conscientious effort on the part of defendant Secretary to assure that the
action taken by him in revoking the lease contract would best <span class="SpellE">subserve</span> public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There could then be no grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is this other circumstance of
weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth by the present
Chief Justice in Ramirez v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
there must be an awareness that what is being judicially reviewed in cases of
this character is to be attributed not only to "the Department of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, but, also, [to] <u>the</u> <u>President</u>
of the Philippines", an implication which follows from the fundamental
postulate that the acts of department secretaries performed in the regular
course of business are, unless they are disapproved or reprobated,
presumptively the acts of the Executive.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What further fortifies
the stand taken by defendant Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources was
the express <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> made by the Executive
secretary of a succeeding administration, acting by authority of the President,
of the decision revoking the lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the task of overturning a decision of a department head is attended
with difficulty, the burden of persuasion becomes much heavier when the
challenged action is before the judiciary encased in the armor of an explicit
presidential approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to
cast an undeserved reflection on a coordinate branch of the government to
impute to a decision reached by it after a careful study of the facts the vice
of unfairness or arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due
regard for the principle of separation of powers would caution against such a
hasty condemnation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say
that it could not happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely
to emphasize that the facts as stipulated by the parties reject such a conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lending support to such a judicial approach is the recognition
that must be paid to the constitutional command that the President exercises
control over all departments, bureaus and offices.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
As was stated by this Court through Justice Padilla: "Moreover, by virtue
of the President's power of control over all executive departments, bureaus or
offices which 'means the power of an officer to alter, modify or nullify or set
aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and
to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter,’ the President
may reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the Director of Lands and the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, precisely, a succeeding President, through his Executive
Secretary, affirmed the decision reached by a former Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, now challenged in this litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is it to be lost sight of that such presidential <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of what was done by a former Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources of a past administration reflected the utmost
fidelity to a constitutional mandate which is of the very essence of the
executive power, namely, his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not admit of doubt that the Constitution being supreme and paramount is
pre-eminently the law that under no circumstance should be disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its provisions must be complied with, its
commands followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It brooks no
evasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President then must take
care lest by inadvertence or less than full awareness of the realities of the
situation what the Constitution ordains is ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to fail in what is of the essence of
executive function, namely the enforcement of and full compliance with the law,
primarily the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the explicit declaration that all natural resources belong
to the state for the benefit of the Filipino people,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
no occupant of the Presidential office can afford to allow a decision of any of
his subordinates, including a department secretary, to stand if thereby there
is no assurance of their judicious exploitation, development or
utilization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be to fail in
his sworn duty, so fitly emphasized by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that plaintiff would not
be able, if awarded such a lease, to comply with what is expected of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely to make clear that the appraisal
made by the department head, especially one that has subsequently received the
approval of the President, as to whether or not a certain party should enjoy
such a privilege is not to be interfered with where, as is so apparent from the
facts disclosed, no grave abuse of discretion is shown.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court ought to
have reached a conclusion affirming the action taken by defendant Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proceeding from the premise, however, that plaintiff's contract was
undoubtedly a property right coming within the purview of the due process
clause of the Constitution, it was its view that plaintiff was denied
procedural due process when it was revoked.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus: "This Court believes that no less than notice and hearing under the
circumstances will satisfy due process, and <u>total</u> lack thereof as in the
case at bar is a gross illegality and abuse of discretion by an administrative
officer from which relief can be obtained upon review by this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That was not the case at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the order of revocation of July 5, 1961 by the then Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, Cesar M. <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span>,
came without plaintiff having been heard, he did present, however, a motion for
reconsider­ation on August 9, 1961 to which was aided, on August 18, 1961, a
twelve-page supporting memorandum.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon such a pleading being denied on <st1:date year="1961" day="12" month="9">September
 12, 1961</st1:date>, he filed, on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="10">October

Then, on November 26, 1962, in his appeal to the President for the reversal of
the determination made by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
the administration having changed in the meanwhile, the matter was again
elaborately discussed in a sixteen-page communication with both the facts and
what he considered to be the controlling law extensively discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">What we said in <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (Phil.), Inc. v.

comes to mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was there stated:
"In its petition for reconsideration before respondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission, petitioner did have the opportunity to make vocal its protest against
the grant of additional compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it sought and was heard on oral argument before respondent
Workmen's Compensation Commission where the opportunity to discuss such a
question was once again afforded it."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
After which came this portion of the opinion: "It cannot be truthfully
said then that it was not heard at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As this Court had occasion to state once, what is sought to be
safeguarded against is not 'lack of previous notice but the denial of
opportunity to be heard on the claim.' The due process requirement therefore
was not altogether disregarded."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor was there a failure to heed the command of substantive due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This matter was not discussed at
all in the lower court decision, but it may not be amiss to consider the
question to ascertain whether the action taken by defendant Secretary suffered
from such infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since due process
is identified with justice and fairness and thus is opposed to any governmental
actuation marked by arbitrariness or caprice, the facts of each particular
litigation are decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
need to refer anew to what did transpire in this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to cast a mist on the lens of
objective analysis to characterize the actuation of defendant Secretary as a
denial of substantive due process being more the expression of a whim rather
than the result of a careful and deliberate appraisal of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was here, to paraphrase <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, no abandonment of reason that led to sheer
oppression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing repugnant
to the fundamental concept of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the fact that the decision of the department head
complained of took place during the Garcia administration, affirmed by the
Executive Secretary, acting for the succeeding President, and such actuation
defended with zeal and vigor by the then Solicitor General of a still another
later incumbent of the Presidential office, certainly possesses a significance
that cannot be ignored or disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were purely partisan considerations that prevailed, then perhaps a
case for substantive due process could have been made out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was anything but that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What could be discerned in the challenged
revocation and its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> by another occupant of
the highest elective office was a resolute determination to act in accordance
with what would best promote public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under such circumstances, there was no deprivation of property tainted
by its failure to abide by the peremptory requirement of the due process
guarantee.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise the finding
of the lower court: "Moreover, this Court agrees with plaintiff's
contention that the order of Revocation would be tantamount to an impairment by
the government of the obligations of his contract."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a> Even
on the assumption that there was an obligation of contract which could not be
impaired by law, this portion of the decision now on appeal is likewise open to
objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is well-settled that a
law within the meaning of this constitutional provision has reference primarily
to statutes and ordinances of municipal corporations.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Executive orders issued by the President whether derived from his
constitutional powers or valid statutes may likewise be considered as such.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not cover, therefore, the exercise of the quasi-judicial power of a
department head even if affirmed by the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrative process in such a case
partakes more of an adjudicatory character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is bereft of any legislative significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It falls outside the scope of the
non-impairment clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense,
the conclusion arrived at by the lower court that the order of revocation was
tantamount to a violation of this constitutional guarantee cannot stand the
test of scrutiny.</p>
