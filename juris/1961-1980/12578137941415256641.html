				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 17, &nbsp;1961, a labor dispute arose between the several unions comprising the employees of the Government Service Insurance System &nbsp;and the latter concerning the implementation &nbsp;of a collective &nbsp;bargaining agreement entered into between them relative to salary scales which labor dispute was &nbsp;certified by &nbsp;the Executive &nbsp;Secretary to &nbsp;the Court &nbsp;of Industrial &nbsp;Relations for action. &nbsp;The validity of this certification was impugned &nbsp;by the unions on the ground that &nbsp;it was unauthorized by law. <p>&nbsp;As an outgrowth of the abovementioned labor dispute a strike was declared by the members of the &nbsp;unions against the GSIS in the &nbsp;course of which attempts &nbsp;were made by the leaders &nbsp;of the &nbsp;unions to &nbsp;negotiate with Gregorio S. Licaros in &nbsp;his capacity &nbsp;as Chairman &lt;4 &nbsp;the &nbsp;Board of Trustees of the GSIS regarding the &nbsp;settlement of their differences, but Licaros refused the proffer of negotiation. As a result, the unions filed a complaint &nbsp;for unfair labor practice &nbsp;against &nbsp;Licaros &nbsp;before the Court of &nbsp;Industrial Relations charging him with refusal to bargain with the unions as authorized by &nbsp;law. &nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the &nbsp;picketing which the members of the unions set up around the premises of the GSIS in an attempt to prevent it to perform its &nbsp;functions, Licaros, &nbsp;who at the same time was &nbsp;the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Development Bank of &nbsp;the Philippines, allowed the officials and a portion of the &nbsp;staff of the GSIS, especially its treasurer, to hold office in &nbsp;the premises of the latter bank in order that its functions will not &nbsp;be disrupted, which action &nbsp;&nbsp;prompted the members of the unions to &nbsp;likewise cause the peaceful picketing of &nbsp;the &nbsp;premises &nbsp;of the bank by &nbsp;displaying placards &nbsp;to &nbsp;inform the public &nbsp;of the labor dispute that was then going on.</p> <p>Hence , on September 27, &nbsp;1961, the &nbsp;Developement Bank of the Philippines filed an action against the several unions before the &nbsp;Court of First Instance of Manila seeking to prohibit &nbsp;the picketing of its &nbsp;premises. &nbsp;At the same time, it prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary &nbsp;injunction &nbsp;pending determination of the case on the merits. Judge &nbsp; Gregorio T. Lantin, &nbsp;who was presiding &nbsp;the court, without &nbsp;previously setting &nbsp;the petition &nbsp;for hearing, &nbsp;immediately issued the &nbsp;writ prayed for upon &nbsp;the filing on the part of the bank of a &nbsp;cash bond in the amount of P20,000.00. &nbsp;As a &nbsp;consequence, the Chief &nbsp;of &nbsp;&nbsp;Police of Manila, assisted by his agents, implemented the order by dispersing &nbsp;those &nbsp;who were &nbsp;engaged in picketing to &nbsp;the extent of arresting &nbsp;some &nbsp;of &nbsp;them &nbsp;who proved &nbsp;hostile even before &nbsp;a &nbsp;copy of the writ was actually served on the unions.</p> <p>Considering that in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction &nbsp;<i>ex parte</i> &nbsp;in &nbsp; a &nbsp;manner contrary &nbsp;to Republic &nbsp;Act 875 Judge Lantin acted without jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, the unions interposed the &nbsp;present petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction.</p> <p>This &nbsp;Court gave due course to the petition, requiring respondents &nbsp;to &nbsp;answer within 5 &nbsp;days from &nbsp;notice, but declined to issue the writ prayed for.</p> <p>In the &nbsp;meantime, the labor dispute &nbsp;that gave rise to the strike and picketing was amicably settled &nbsp;as &nbsp;a result of which the employees composing the unions &nbsp;returned to work. &nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, also, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by respondent court became moot with &nbsp;the cancellation of the cash bond put &nbsp;up by the Development Bank of the &nbsp;Philippines. &nbsp;It, &nbsp;therefore, &nbsp;appears that &nbsp;this petition has &nbsp;also become moot.</p> <p>Wherefore, petition is dismissed. &nbsp;No costs.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, &nbsp;C. &nbsp;J., &nbsp;Padilla, &nbsp;Labrador, &nbsp;Barrera, &nbsp;Paredes, Dizon, Regala</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</p> </div>
