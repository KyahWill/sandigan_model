				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These cases are all petitions for habeas corpus, the petitioners
having been arrested and detained by the military by virtue of the President's
Proclamation No. 1081, dated September 21, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset a word of clarification is in order.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not the decision of the Court in the
sense that a decision represents a consensus of the required majority of its
members not only on the judgment itself but also on the rationalization of the
issues and the conclusions arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the final result the vote is practically unanimous; this is a statement
of my individual opinion as well as a summary of the voting on the major
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why no particular Justice has
been designated to write just one opinion for the entire Court will presently
be explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">At one point during our deliberations on these cases it was
suggested that as Chief Justice I should write that opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impracticability of the suggestion
shortly became apparent for a number of reasons, only two of which need be
mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, the discussions, as
they began to touch on particular issues, revealed a lack of agreement among
the Justices as to whether some of those issues should be taken up although it
was not necessary to do so, they being merely convenient for the purpose of
ventilating vexing questions of public interest, or whether the decision should
be limited to those issues which are really material and decisive in these
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, there was no agreement
as to the manner the issues should be treated and developed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same destination would be reached, so to
speak, but through different routes and by means of different vehicles of
approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writing of separate
opinions by individual Justices was thus unavoidable, and understandably so for
still another reason, namely, that although little overt reference to it was
made at the time, the future verdict of history was very much a factor in the
thinking of the members, no other case of such transcendental significance to
the life of the nation having before confronted this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second — and this to me was the insuperable
obstacle — I was and am of the opinion, which was shared by six other Justices<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
at the time the question was voted upon, that petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> motion of December 28, 1973 to withdraw his
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(G.R. No. L-35539) should be
granted, and therefore I was in no position to set down the ruling of the Court
on each of the arguments raised by him, except indirectly, insofar as they had
been raised likewise in the other cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be explained at this point that when the Court voted on
<span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> motion to withdraw his petition he was still
under detention without charges, and continued to remain so up to the time the
separate opinions of the individual Justices were put in final form preparatory
to their promulgation on September 12, which was the last day of Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar's</span> tenure in the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Before they could be promulgated, however, a major development supervened:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
was released by the President in the morning of <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view thereof all the members of this Court except Justice Castro
agreed to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> petition on the ground
that it had become moot, with those who originally voted to grant the motion
for withdrawal citing said motion as an additional ground for such dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in the other cases, except <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. (G.R. No. L-35546), either have been
permitted to withdraw their petitions or have been released from detention
subject to certain restrictions.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, formal charges of murder,
subversion and illegal possession of firearms were lodged against him with a
Military Commission on August 11, 1973; and on the following August 23 he
challenged the jurisdiction of said Commission as well as his continued
detention by virtue of those charges in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition filed in this Court (G.R. No. L-37364).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question came up as to whether or not <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> petition for habeas corpus should be dismissed on
the ground that the case as to him should more appropriately be resolved in
this new petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the twelve Justices,
however, eight voted against such dismissal and chose to consider the case on
the merits.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> motion to withdraw his
petition I voted in favor of granting it for two reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place such withdrawal would not
emasculate the decisive and fundamental issues of public interest that demanded
to be resolved, for they were also raised in the other cases which still
remained pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, since it was
this petitioner's personal liberty that was at stake, I believed he had the
right to renounce the application for habeas corpus he initiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if that right were not absolute I still
would respect his choice to remove the case from this Court's cognizance,
regardless of the fact that I disagreed with many of his reasons for so
doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not escape a sense of
irony in this Court's turning down the plea to withdraw on the ground, so he
alleges among others, that this is no longer the Court to which he originally
applied for relief because its members have taken new oaths of office under the
1973 Constitution and then ruling adversely to him on the merits of his
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that some of the statements in the motion are an
affront to the dignity of this Court and therefore should not be allowed to
pass unanswered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any answer, however,
would not be foreclosed by allowing the withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For my part, since most of those statement s
are of a subjective character, being matters of personal belief and opinion, I
see no point in refuting them in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed my impression is that they were beamed less to this Court than to
the world outside and designed to make political capital of his personal
situation, as the publicity given to them by some segments of the foreign press
and by local underground propaganda newssheets subsequently confirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in fact from that perspective that I
deemed it proper to respond in kind, that is, from a non-judicial forum, in an
address I delivered on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="2">February 19,
 1974</st1:date> before the LAWASIA, the Philippine Bar Association and the
Philippine Lawyers' Association.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, it may be stated, is
of the opinion that a simple majority of seven votes out of twelve is legally
sufficient to make the withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span>
petition effective, on the theory that the requirement of a majority of eight
votes applies only to a decision on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, as it turned out, after petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> was released by the President on September 11 all
the members of this Court except Justice Castro were agreed that his petition
had become moot and therefore should no longer be considered on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, some of
the opinions of the individual members, particularly Justices Castro and <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, should be taken in the time setting in which
they were prepared, that is, before the order for the release of <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> was issued.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><i>The Cases.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The events which form the background of these nine petitions are
related, either briefly or in great detail, in the separate opinions filed by
the individual Justices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners
were arrested and held pursuant to General Order No. 2 of the President
(September 22, 1972), "for being participants or for having given aid and
comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in the country and
to take over the Government by force . . ."</p>

<p class="BODY">General Order No. 2 was issued by the President in the exercise
of the powers he assumed by virtue of Proclamation No. 1081 (September 21,
1972) placing the entire country <b>under martial law</b>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portions of the proclamation immediately
in point read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the <b>Philippines</b>,
by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10, Paragraph
(2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as defined in
Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in my capacity
as their Commander-in-Chief, do hereby command the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent or
suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as any act of insurrection or
rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees, orders and
regulations promulgated by me <b>personally or upon my direction.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently
detained, as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the
crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and <b>all other crimes and offenses</b>
committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in
connection therewith, for crimes against national security and the law of
nations, crimes against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority,
rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed
by public officers, and for such other crimes as will be enumerated in orders
that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any
violation of any decree, order or regulation promulgated by me personally or
promulgated upon my direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise
ordered released by me or by my duly designated representative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provision of the 1935 Constitution referred to in the
proclamation reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"the President
shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or
place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law."</p>

<blockquote>1. The first major issue raised by the parties is whether this
Court may inquire into the validity of Proclamation No. 1081. Stated more
concretely, is the existence of conditions claimed to justify the exercise of
the power to declare martial law subject to judicial inquiry?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the question political or <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> in character?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Justices <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, Fernandez, and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
hold that the question is political and therefore its determination is beyond
the jurisdiction of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reasons are given at length in the separate opinions they have respectively
signed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernandez adds that as a
member of the Convention that drafted the 1973 Constitution he believes that
"the Convention put an <i>imprimatur</i> on the proposition that the
validity of a martial law proclamation and its continuation is political and
non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> in character." </p>

<p class="BODY">Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, on the other hand,
believes that political questions are not <i>per se</i> beyond the Court's
jurisdiction, the judicial power vested in it by the Constitution being plenary
and all-embracing, but that as a matter of policy implicit in the Constitution
itself the Court should abstain from interfering with the Executive's
Proclamation, dealing as it does with national security, for which the
responsibility is vested by the charter in him alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Court should act, Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> opines, when its abstention from acting would
result in manifest and palpable transgression of the Constitution proven by
facts of judicial notice, no reception of evidence being contemplated for purposes
of such judicial action.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the postulate of non-<span class="SpellE">justiciability</span>
as discussed in those opinions involves disparate methods of approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE"><b>Esguerra</b></span>
maintains that the findings of the President on the existence of the grounds for
the declaration of martial law are final and conclusive upon the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He disagrees vehemently with the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i>vs. </i>Garcia, 42 SCRA 448, <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1971</st1:date>, and advocates a
return to <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i>vs. </i>Baker, 5 Phil. 87
(1905), and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, 91 Phil. 882 (1952). Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, for his part, holds that <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
need not be overturned, indeed does not control in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He draws a distinction between the power of
the President to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, which was
the issue in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>, and his power to proclaim
martial law, calling attention to the fact that while the Bill of Rights
prohibits suspension of the privilege except in the instances specified
therein, it places no such prohibition or qualification with respect to the
declaration of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Antonio, with whom Justices <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>,
Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> concur, finds that there is no
dispute as to the existence of a state of rebellion in the country, and on that
premise emphasizes the factor of necessity for the exercise by the President of
his power under the Constitution to declare martial law, holding that the
decision as to whether or not there is such <span class="SpellE"><i>necesssity</i></span>
is <i>wholly </i>confided to him and therefore is not subject to judicial inquiry,
his responsibility being directly to the people.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arrayed on the side of <span class="SpellE">justiciability</span>
are Justices Castro, Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
hold that the constitutional sufficiency of the proclamation may be inquired
into by the Court, and would thus apply the principle laid down in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> although that case refers to the power of the
President to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recognition of <span class="SpellE">justiciability</span>
accorded to the question in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>, it should be
emphasized, is there expressly distinguished from the power of judicial review
in ordinary civil or criminal cases, and is limited to ascertaining
"merely whether he (the President) has gone beyond the constitutional
limits of his jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested in him or to
determine the wisdom of his act." The test is not whether the President's
decision is correct but whether, in suspending the writ, he did or did not act <i>arbitrarily</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying this test, the finding by the
Justices just mentioned is that there was no arbitrariness in the President's
proclamation of martial law pursuant to the 1935 Constitution; and I concur
with them in that finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual
bases for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,
particularly in regard to the existence of a state of rebellion in the country,
had not disappeared, indeed had been exacerbated, as events shortly before said
proclamation clearly demonstrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this point the Court is practically unanimous; Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
merely <b>refrains</b> from discussing it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as my own opinion is concerned the cleavage in the Court
on the issue of <span class="SpellE">justiciability</span> is of not much more
than academic interest for purposes of arriving at a judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not unduly exercised by American
decisions on the subject written in another age and political clime, or by
theories, of foreign authors in political science.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present state of martial law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is peculiarly Filipino and fits into no traditional patterns or judicial
precedents.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place I am convinced (as are the other Justices),
without need of receiving evidence as in an ordinary adversary court
proceeding, that a state of rebellion existed in the country when Proclamation
No. 1081 was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a matter of
contemporary history within the cognizance not only of the courts but of all
observant people residing here at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many of the facts and events recited in detail in the different "<span class="SpellE">Whereases</span>" of the proclamation are of common
knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The state of rebellion
continues up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
argument that while armed hostilities go on in several provinces in <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>
there are none in other regions except in isolated pockets in <st1:place>Luzon</st1:place>,
and that therefore there is no need to maintain martial law all over the
country, ignores the sophisticated nature and ramifications of rebellion in a
modern setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not consist
simply of armed clashes between organized and identifiable groups on fields of
their own choosing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes
subversion of the most subtle kind, necessarily clandestine and operating
precisely where there is no actual fighting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Underground propaganda, through printed newssheets or rumors
disseminated in whispers; recruitment of armed and ideological adherents,
raising of funds, procurement of arms and <b>materiel</b>, fifth-column
activities including sabotage and intelligence — all these are part of the
rebellion which by their nature are usually conducted far from the battle
fronts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot be counteracted
effectively unless recognized and dealt with in that <b>context</b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, my view, which coincides with that of other members of
the Court as stated in their opinions, is that the question of validity of
Proclamation No. 1081 has been foreclosed by the transitory provision of the
1973 Constitution [Art. XVII, Sec. 3(2)] that "all proclamations, orders,
decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent
President shall be part of the law of the land and shall remain valid, legal,
binding and effective even after . . . the ratification of this Constitution
..." To be sure, there is an attempt in these cases to resuscitate the
issue of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that, however, is
behind us now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question has been
laid to rest by our decision in <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> <i>vs</i>.
Executive Secretary (L-36142, 50 SCRA 30, March 31, 1973), and of course by the
existing political realities both in the conduct of national affairs and in our
relations with other countries.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the effect of the transitory provision Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma withholds her assent to any sweeping statement
that the same in effect validated, in the constitutional sense, all "such
proclamations, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the
incumbent President." All that she concedes is that the transitory
provision merely gives them "the <i>imprimatur</i> of a law but not of a
constitutional mandate," and as such therefore "are subject to
judicial review when proper under the Constitution."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the political-or-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
question controversy — indeed, any inquiry by this Court in the present cases
into the constitutional sufficiency of the factual bases for the proclamation
of martial law — has become moot and purposeless as a consequence of the
general referendum of <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="7">July 27-28, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question propounded to the voters
was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under the (1973)
Constitution, the President, if he so desires, can continue in office beyond
1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you want President Marcos to
continue beyond 1973 and finish the reforms he initiated under Martial
Law?" The overwhelming majority of those who cast their ballots, including
citizens between 15 and 18 years, voted affirmatively on the proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question was thereby 'removed from the
area of presidential power under the Constitution and transferred to the seat
of sovereignty itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever may be
the nature of the exercise of that power by the President in the beginning —
whether or not purely political and therefore non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
— this Court is precluded from applying its judicial yardstick to the act of
the sovereign. </p>

<blockquote>2. With respect to the petitioners who have been released from
detention but have not withdrawn their petitions because they are still subject
to certain restrictions,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the ruling of the Court is that the petitions should be dismissed. The power to
detain persons even without charges for acts related to the situation which
justifies the proclamation of martial law, such as the existence of a state of
rebellion, necessarily implies the power (subject, in the opinion of the
Justices who consider <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> applicable to the same
test of arbitrariness laid down therein), to impose upon the released <b>detainees</b>
conditions or restrictions which are germane to and necessary to carry out the
purposes of the proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice
Fernando, however, "is for easing the restrictions on the right to travel
of petitioner Rodrigo" and others similarly situated and so to this extent
dissents from the ruling of the majority; while Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
believes that those restrictions do not constitute deprivation of physical
liberty within the meaning of the constitutional provision on the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It need only be added that, to my mind, implicit in a state of
martial law is the suspension of the said privilege with respect to persons
arrested or detained for acts related to the basic objective of the
proclamation, which is to suppress invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or to
safeguard public safety against imminent danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preservation of society and national
survival take precedence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
particular point, that is, that the proclamation of martial law automatically
suspends the privilege of the writ as to the persons referred to, the Court is
practically unanimous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernando,
however, says that to him that is still an open question; and Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma qualifiedly dissents from the majority in her
separate opinion, but for the reasons she discusses therein votes for the
dismissal of the petitions.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="PONENTE">ANTONIO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">These applications for writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> present for
review Proclamation No. 1081 of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
placing the country under martial law on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>, and the legality of the arrest and
detention of prisoners under the aforesaid proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues posed have confronted every
democratic government in every clime and in every age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have always recurred in times of crisis
when the nation's safety and continued existence are in peril.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Involved is the problem of harmonizing two
basic interests that lie at the foundation of every democratic constitutional
system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is contained in <span class="SpellE">Rosseau's</span> formulation, "the people's first intention
is that the State shall not perish," in other words, the right of the
State to its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second are
the civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution, which "imply the
existence of an organized system maintaining public order without which liberty
itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses...." <span class="GramE">(Cox vs. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 [1940]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitions for <i>habeas corpus</i> initially raise the
legality of the arrest and detention of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the respondents, however, plead, in
defense, the declaration of martial law and the consequent suspension of the
privilege of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the validity of Proclamation No. 1081 is the
ultimate constitutional issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hearings were held on September 26 and 29 and <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1972</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, some of the petitioners were allowed to withdraw their
petitions.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Most of the petitioners were subsequently released from custody under certain
conditions and some of them insist that their cases have not become moot as
their freedom of movement is restricted.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As of this date, only petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. (L-35546) remains in military custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1973</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
Jr. was charged before the military commission with the crimes of subversion
under the Anti-Subversion Act (Republic Act No. 1700), murder and illegal
possession of firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 23,
1973, he filed an action for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition (L-35546) with
this Court, assailing the validity of his trial before the military commission,
because the creation of military tribunals for the trial of offenses committed
by civilians is unconstitutional in the absence of a state of war or status of
belligerency; being martial law measures, they have ceased with the cessation
of the emergency; and he could not expect a fair trial because the President of
the Philippines had prejudged his case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That action is pending consideration and decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 28, 1973, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
moved to withdraw his petition (L-35539), claiming that there was delay in the
disposition of his case, and that as a consequence of the decision of this
Court in <span class="SpellE"><i>Javellana</i></span><i> vs. Executive Secretary</i>
(L-36142, March 31, 1973) and of the action of the members of this Court in
taking an oath to support the New Constitution, he has reason to believe that
he cannot "reasonably expect to get justice in this case."
Respondents oppose this motion on the ground that public interest or questions
of public importance are involved and the reasons given are factually untrue
and contemptuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> was released from military custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of his release, it was the consensus
of the majority of the Court to consider his case as moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall now proceed to discuss the issues posed by the remaining
cases.</p>

<blockquote>1. <span class="GramE">Is</span> the determination by the President
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the <i>necessity</i> for the exercise of his power to declare martial law
political, hence, final and conclusive upon the courts, or is it <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> and, therefore, his determination is subject to
review by the courts?</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Assuming <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span> to be applicable,
can it be said that the President acted arbitrarily in issuing Proclamation No.
1081?</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Assuming that the issues are <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">justiciable</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> can the Supreme
Court upon the facts of record and those judicially known to It now declare
that the necessity for martial law has already ceased?</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Under a regime of martial law, can the Court inquire into the
legal justification for the arrest and detention as well as the other
constraints upon the individual liberties of the petitioners?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the affirmative, does it have any adequate
legal basis to declare that their detention is no longer authorized by the
Constitution?</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><i>CONSTITUTION INTENDED STRONG EXECUTIVE<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The right of a government to maintain its existence is the most
pervasive aspect of sovereignty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
protect the nation's continued existence, from external as well as internal
threats, the government "is invested with all those inherent and implied
powers which, at the time of adopting the Constitution, were generally
considered to belong to every government as such, and as being essential to the
exercise of its functions" (Mr. Justice Bradley, concurring in <i>Legal
Tender Cases</i> [US] 12 Wall. 457, 554, 556, 20 <span class="SpellE">L.ed</span>.
287, 314, 315).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To attain this end,
nearly all other considerations are to be subordinated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional power to act upon this
basic principle has been recognized by all courts in every nation at different
periods and diverse circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">These powers which are to be exercised for the nation's
protection and security have been lodged by the Constitution under Article VII,
Section 10(2) thereof, on the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
who is clothed with exclusive authority to determine the occasion on which the
powers shall be called forth.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional provision expressly vesting in the President
the power to place "the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law
in case of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or imminent danger thereof when
the public safety requires it,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> is taken bodily from the Jones Law
with the difference that the President of the United States had the power to
modify or vacate the action taken by the Governor-General.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> Although the Civil Governor, under
Section 5 of the Philippine Bill of 1902, could, with the approval of the
Philippine Commission, suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
no power to proclaim martial law was specifically granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This power is not mentioned in the Federal
Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply designates the President as
commander-in-chief:</p>

<blockquote>"The President shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Army and
Navy of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and of the militia of the several states when called into actual service of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
. . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Its absence in the Federal Constitution
notwithstanding, President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War placed some
parts of the country under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He predicated the exercise of this power on his authority as
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and on the ground of extreme necessity
for the preservation of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When not expressly provided in the
Constitution, its justification, therefore, would be necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus some authoritative writers view it as
"not a part of the Constitution but is rather a power to preserve the
Constitution when constitutional methods prove inadequate to that end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the law of necessity."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>
Since the meaning of the term "martial law" is obscure, as is the
power exercisable by the Chief Executive under martial law, resort must be had
to precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the powers of the
Chief Executive under the Commander-in-Chief clause of the Federal Constitution
have been drawn not only from general and specific provisions of the
Constitution but from historical precedents of Presidential action in times of
crises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lincoln invoked his authority
under the Commander-in-Chief clause of the Federal Constitution for the series
of extraordinary measures which he took during the Civil War, such as the
calling of volunteers for military service, the augmentation of the Army and
Navy, the payment of $2 million from the <span class="SpellE">unappropriated</span>
funds in the Treasury to persons unauthorized to receive it, the closing of the
Post Office to "treasonable correspondence," the blockade of Southern
ports, the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the arrests and
detentions of persons who were represented to him as being engaged in or
contemplating "treasonable practices" — all this for the most part
was done without the least statutory authorization from Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actions of <st1:city><st1:place>Lincoln</st1:place></st1:city>
"assert for the President," according to Corwin, "an initiative
of indefinite scope and legislative in effect in meeting the domestic aspects
of a war emergency."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> The creation of public offices is
conferred by the Federal Constitution to Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During World War I, however, President
Wilson, on the basis of his power under the "Commander-in-Chief"
clause of the Federal Constitution, created "public offices," which
were copied in lavish scale by President Roosevelt in World War II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The principal canons of constitutional
interpretation are in wartime set aside," according to Corwin, "so
far as concerns both the scope of national power and the capacity of the
President to gather unto himself all the constitutionally available powers in
order the more effectively to focus them upon the task of the hour."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
The presidential power, "building on accumulated precedents has taken on
at times, under the stimulation of emergency conditions," according to two
eminent commentators, the "dimensions of executive prerogative as
described by John Locke, of a power to wit, to fill needed gaps in the law, or
even to supersede it so far as may be requisite to realize the fundamental law
of nature and government, namely, that as much <span class="GramE">as</span> may
be all the members of society are to be preserved."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the framers of the 1935 Constitution
were aware of these precedents and of the scope of the power that had been
exercised by the Presidents of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in times of grave crisis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The framers of
the Constitution "were not only idealists but also practical-minded
men." "While they abjured wars of aggression they well knew that for
the country to survive provisions for its defense had to be made."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><i>TEXTUALLY DEMONSTRABLE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT OF
ISSUE TO THE PRESIDENT<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of making the President of the Philippines simply the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces, with authority whenever it becomes
necessary to call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless
violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, the framers of the 1935 Constitution
expressly conferred upon him the exclusive power and authority to suspend the
privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the Philippines, or any
part thereof, under martial law.</p>

<blockquote>"The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it he may suspend the privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The condition which would warrant the
exercise of the power was not confined to <i>actual</i> invasion, insurrection
or rebellion, but also to <i>imminent danger thereof,</i> when the public
safety requires it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident,
therefore, that while American Presidents derived these extraordinary powers by
implication from the State's right to self-preservation, the President of the
Philippines was expressly granted by the Constitution with all the powers
necessary to protect the nation in times of grave peril.</p>

<p class="BODY">The safety and well-being of the nation required that the
President should not be hampered by lack of authority but was to be a
"strong executive who could maintain the unity of the nation with
sufficient powers and prerogatives to save the country during great crises and
dangers."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As Delegate Jose P. Laurel comprehensively explained</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> A strong executive he is
intended to be, because a strong executive we shall need, especially in the
early years of our independent, or semi-independent existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A weak executive is synonymous with a weak
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall not be a 'monarch'
or a dictator in time of profound and Octavian peace, <i>but he virtually so
becomes in an extraordinary emergency</i>; and whatever may be his position, he
bulwarks, normally, the fortifications of a strong constitutional government,
but abnormally, in extreme cases, he is suddenly ushered in as a Minerva,
full-grown and in full panoply of war, <i>to occupy the vantage ground as the
ready protector and defender of the life and honor of his nation</i>."
(Italics supplied.)<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The concentration of an amplitude of power in the hand of the
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, who is at the same
time the elected civilian Chief of State, is predicated upon the fact that it
is he who must initially shoulder the burden and deal with the emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the nature of his position he possesses
and wields the extraordinary powers of self-preservation of the democratic,
constitutional state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In times of crisis
there is indeed unification of responsibility and centralization of authority
in the Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
concentration of governmental power in a democracy faced by an emergency,"
wrote <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rossiter</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> "is a corrective to the crisis inefficiencies
inherent in the doctrine of the separation of powers. . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In normal times the separation of powers
forms a distinct obstruction to arbitrary governmental action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this same token, in abnormal times it may
form an insurmountable barrier to decisive emergency action in behalf of the
State and its independent existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are moments in the life of any government when all the powers must
work together in unanimity of purpose and action, even if this means the
temporary union of executive, legislative and judicial powers in the hands of
one man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more complete the separation
of powers in a constitutional system, the more difficult and yet the more
necessary will be their fusion in time of crisis." [<span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span>,
Constitutional Dictatorship, 288-289.]</p>

<p class="BODY">It was intended, however, that the exercise of these
extraordinary powers is for the preservation of the State, its democratic
institutions, and the permanent freedom of its citizens.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><i>RESPONSIBILITY IMPLIES BROAD AUTHORITY AND
DISCRETION<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The conditions of war, of insurrection or rebellion, or of any
other national emergency are as varied as the means required for meeting them
and it is, therefore, within the contemplation of the Constitution that the
Chief Executive, to preserve the safety of the nation on those times of
national peril, should have the broadest authority compatible with the
emergency in selecting the means and adopting the measures which in his honest
judgment are necessary for the preservation of the nation's safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The circumstances that endanger the
safety of nations are infinite," wrote Alexander Hamilton, "and for
this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to
which the care of it is committed. . .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is one of those truths which to a correct and unprejudiced mind
carries its own evidence along with it, and may be obscured, but cannot be made
plainer by argument or reasoning. . . .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The means ought to be in proportion to the end; the persons from whose
agency the attainment of any end is expected ought to possess the means by
which it is to be attained."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Mr. Madison expressed the same idea
in the following terms: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>"It is vain
to impose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worse than in vain, because it plants
in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">"Unquestionably," wrote Chief Justice Taney in <i>Luther
v. Borden</i> (7 How. 44, [1849], 12 <span class="SpellE">L.ed</span>. 600),
"a State may use its military power to put down an armed insurrection, too
strong to be controlled by the civil authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The power is essential to the existence of every government, essential
to the preservation of order and free institutions, and is as necessary to the
States of this <st1:place>Union</st1:place> as to any other government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State itself must determine what degree
of force the crisis demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the
Government of Rhode Island deemed the armed opposition so formidable, and so
ramified throughout the State, as to require the use of its military force and
the declaration of martial law, we see no ground upon which this Court can
question its authority."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <i>Prize</i> cases (17 <span class="SpellE">L.ed</span>.
476, [1863]), the Court ascribed to the President of the United States, by
virtue of his powers as Chief Executive and as Commander-in-Chief, the power
which in <i>Luther v. Borden</i> is attributed to the government as a whole, to
treat of insurrection as a state of war, and the scene of the insurrection as a
seat or theater of war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Justice Grier
in the <i>Prize</i> cases significantly stated:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Whether the President in fulfilling his duties as Commander?in-Chief,
in suppressing an insurrection, has met with such hostile resistance, and <i>a
civil war of such alarming proportions as will compel him to accord to them the
character of belligerents, is </i>a question<i> to be decided by him, and this
court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the Political Department</i>
of the government, to which this power was entrusted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'He must determine what degree of force the
crisis demands.'" (Italics supplied.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Hirabayashi</i></span><i> v. United
States</i>, where the Court upheld the curfew regulations affecting persons of
Japanese ancestry as valid military measures to prevent espionage and sabotage,
there was again <span class="SpellE">reaffirmance</span> of the view that the
Constitution has granted to the President and to Congress in the exercise of
the war powers a "wide scope for the exercise of judgment and discretion
in determining the nature and extent of the threatened danger and in the
selection of the means for resisting it."</p>

<p class="BODY">"Since the Constitution commits to the Executive and to
Congress the exercise of the war power in all the vicissitudes and conditions
of warfare, it has necessarily given them wide scope for the exercise of
judgment and discretion in determining the nature and extent of the threatened
injury or danger and in the selection of the means for resisting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> <span class="SpellE">Quirin</span>, supra (317 <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>

19, 29, 6 L <span class="GramE">ed</span> 537, 540).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where as they did here, the conditions call
for the exercise of judgment and discretion and for the choice of means by
those branches of the Government on which the Constitution has placed the
responsibility of war-making, it is not for any court to sit in review of the
wisdom of their action or substitute its judgment for theirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The actions taken must be appraised in the light of the

<p class="BODY">It is, however, insisted that even with the broad discretion
granted to the President by the Constitution in ascertaining whether or not
conditions exist for the declaration of martial law, his findings in support of
such declaration should nevertheless be subject to judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to bear in mind that <span class="GramE">We</span>
are here dealing with a plenary and exclusive power conferred upon the Chief
Executive by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power
itself is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, and under circumstances
which may be vital to the existence of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A prompt and unhesitating obedience to orders
issued in connection therewith is indispensable as every delay and obstacle to
its immediate implementation may jeopardize the public interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">By reason of his unique position as Chief Executive and as
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, it is he, more than
any other high official of the government, who has the authority and the means
of obtaining through the various facilities in the civil and military agencies
of the government under his command, information promptly and effectively, from
every quarter and corner of the state about the actual peace and order
condition of the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection
with his duty and responsibility, he is necessarily accorded the wise and
objective counsel of trained and experienced specialists on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the Court could obtain all available
information, it would lack the facility of determining whether or not the insurrection
or rebellion or the imminence thereof poses a danger to the public safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could the courts recreate a complete
picture of the emergency in the face of which the President acted, in order to
adequately judge his military action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Absent any judicially discoverable and manageable standards for
resolving judicially those questions, such a task for a court to undertake may
well-nigh be impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the President, who is responsible for the peace and security of the
nation, is necessarily compelled by the Constitution to make those
determinations and decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter
is committed to him for determination by criteria of political and military
expediency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There exists, therefore, no
standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience by reference to which his
decision can be reviewed by the courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> Indeed, those are military
decisions and in their very nature, "military decisions are not
susceptible of intelligent and judicial appraisal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not pretend to rest on evidence, but
are made on information that often would not be admissible and on assumptions
that could not be proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Information in
support of an order could not be disclosed to courts without danger that it
would reach the enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can
courts act on communications made in confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, courts can never have any real
alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the
order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> He
is necessarily constituted the judge of the existence of the exigency in the

<p class="BODY">Both reason and authority, therefore, dictate that the
determination of the <i>necessity</i> for the exercise of the power to declare
martial law is within the exclusive domain of the President and his
determination is final and conclusive upon the courts and upon all

<p class="BODY">The existing doctrine at the time of the framing and adoption of
the 1935 Constitution was that of <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i>vs</i>.
Baker (5 Phil., 87).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>It enunciated
the principle that when the Governor-General with the approval of the
Philippine Commission, under Section 5 of the Act of Congress of July, 1, 1902,
declares that a state of rebellion, insurrection or invasion exists, and by
reason thereof the public safety requires the suspension of the privileges of

Chief Executive has decided that conditions exist justifying the suspension of
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus, courts will presume that such
conditions continue to exist until the same authority</i> <i>has decided that

Taney in <i>Martin vs. Mott</i> (12 Wheat 29-31), is the sole judge of the

emergencies to exist, its action is not subject to review or liable to be

<p class="BODY"><i>The dangers and difficulties which would grow out of the
adoption of a contrary rule are clearly and ably pointed out in the <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> case</i>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"If the investigation and findings of the President, or the
Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, are not conclusive
and final as against the judicial department of the Government, then <i>every
officer</i> whose duty it is to maintain order and protect the lives and <i>property
of the people may refuse to act, and apply to the judicial department of the
Government for another investigation</i> and conclusion concerning the same
conditions, to the end that they may be protected against civil actions
resulting from illegal acts."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Owing to conditions at times, a state of insurrection,
rebellion, or invasion may arise suddenly and may jeopardize the very existence
of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose, for example, that
one of the thickly populated Governments situated near this Archipelago,
anxious to extend its power and territory, should suddenly decide to invade
these <st1:place>Islands</st1:place>, and should, without warning, appear in
one of the remote harbors with a powerful fleet and at once begin to land
troops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The governor or military
commander of the particular district or province notifies the Governor-General
by <i>telegraph of this landing of troops</i> and that the people of the
district are in collusion with such invasion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Might not the Governor-General and the Commission accept this telegram
as sufficient evidence and proof of the facts communicated and at once take
steps, even to the extent of suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, as might appear to them to be necessary to repel such
invasion?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that all men
interested in the maintenance and stability of the Government would answer this
question in the affirmative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But suppose some one, who has been Arrested in the district
upon the ground that his detention would assist in restoring order and in
repelling the invasion, applies for the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, alleging
that no invasion actually exists; may the judicial department of the Government
call the officers actually engaged in the field before it and away from their
posts of duty for the purpose of explaining and furnishing proof to it
concerning the existence or nonexistence of the facts proclaimed to exist by the
legislative and executive branches of the State?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so, then the courts may effectually tie
the hands of the executive, whose special duty it is to enforce the laws and
maintain order, until the invaders have actually accomplished their
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interpretation contended
for here by the applicants, so pregnant with detrimental results, could not
have been intended by the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> when it enacted the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is the duty of the legislative branch of the Government to
make such laws and regulations as will effectually conserve peace and good
order and protect the lives and property of the citizens of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the Governor-General to
take such steps as he deems wise and necessary for the purpose of enforcing such
laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every delay and hindrance and
obstacle which prevents a strict enforcement of laws under the conditions
mentioned necessarily tends to jeopardize public interest and the safety of the
whole people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>If the judicial
department of the Government, or any officer in the Government, has a right to
contest the orders of the President or of the Governor-General under the
conditions above supposed, before complying with such orders, then the hands of
the President or the Governor-General may be tied until the very object of the
rebels or <span class="SpellE">insurrectos</span> or invaders has been
accomplished</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is urged that
the President, or the Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine
Commission, might be mistaken as to the actual conditions; that the legislative
department — the Philippine Commission — might, by resolution, declare after
investigation, that a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion exists, and
that the public safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, when, as a matter of fact, no such conditions actually existed;
that the President, or Governor-General acting upon the authority of the
Philippine Commission, might by proclamation suspend the privilege of the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i>, without there<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>actually existing the conditions mentioned in the act of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the applicants allege in
their argument in support of their application for the writ of <i>habeas
corpus,</i> that the legislative and executive branches of the Government might
reach a wrong conclusion from their investigations of the actual conditions, or
might, through a desire to oppress and harass the people, declare that a state
of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion existed and that public safety required
the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, when
actually and in fact no such conditions did exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can not assume that the legislative and
executive branches will act or take any action based upon such motives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, it cannot be assumed that the legislative and
executive branches of the Government, with all the machinery which those
branches have at their command for examining into the conditions in any part of
the Archipelago, will fail to obtain all existing information concerning actual
conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the
executive branch of the Government to constantly inform the legislative branch
of the Government of the condition of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> as to
the prevalence of peace or disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
executive branch of the Government, through its numerous branches of the civil
and military, ramifies every portion of the Archipelago, and is enabled thereby
to obtain information from every quarter and corner of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can the judicial department of the
Government, with its very limited machinery for the purpose of investigating
general conditions, be any <span class="GramE">more sure</span> of ascertaining
the true conditions throughout the Archipelago, or in any particular districts
than the other branches of the Government?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We think not." (5 Phil., pp. 93-96.)</blockquote>

Constitutional Convention of 1934.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">This was the state of Philippine jurisprudence on the matter,
when the Constitutional Convention met on <st1:date year="1934" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1934</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be recalled that, under the Philippine Bill of 1902, the suspension of the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> by the Governor-General was
subject to the approval of the Philippine Commission (Section 5, Act of
Congress of July 1, 1902), while, under Section 21 of the Jones Law of 1916,
the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> as well as
the proclamation of martial law by the Governor-General could be modified or
vacated by the President of the United States.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the first Draft was submitted conferring the power to suspend the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> exclusively upon the President,
Delegate <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> proposed an amendment to the effect
that the National Assembly should be the organ empowered to suspend the
privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and, when not in session, the
same may be done by the President with the consent of the majority of the
Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the provisions of
the Draft, Delegate <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> argued, "the Chief
Executive would be the only authority to determine the existence of the reasons
for the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and, according to Philippine jurisprudence,
the Supreme Court would refuse to review the findings of the Executive on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he added, arrests
would be <span class="GramE">effected</span> by military men who were generally
arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would be arresting
persons connected with the rebellion, insurrection, invasion; some of them
might also be arresting other persons without any cause whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result would be that many persons might
find themselves detained when in fact they had no connection whatsoever with
the disturbances."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> Notwithstanding the brilliant
arguments of Delegate <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, the Convention voted
down the amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evident was the
clear intent of the framers of the Charter of vesting on the President the
exclusive power of suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
and the conclusive power to determine whether the exigency has arisen requiring
the suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no opposition
in the Convention to the grant on the President of the exclusive power to place
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law.</p>

a strong executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of Section 10, Paragraph 2, of Article VII of the
1935 Constitution was, therefore, adopted in the light of the Court's
interpretation in <span class="SpellE"><i>Barcelon</i></span><i> vs. Baker</i>.</p>

vs. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 30, 1952, or 17 years after the ratification of the
1935 Constitution, this Court in <i>Montenegro vs. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span></i>,
(91 Phil., 882, 887), construing the power of the President of the Philippines
under Article VII, Section 10, Paragraph 2, of the Constitution, re-affirmed
the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><i>Barcelon</i></span><i> vs. Baker,</i>
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We agree with the Solicitor
General that in the light of the view of the United States Supreme Court
through Marshall, Taney and Story quoted with approval in <span class="SpellE"><i>Barcelon</i></span><i>
vs. Baker</i> (5 Phil., 87, 99-100), the authority to decide whether the
exigency has arisen requiring suspension belongs to the President and <i>'his
decision is final and conclusive'</i> upon the courts and upon all other
persons."</p>

<p class="BODY">On Montenegro's contention that there is no state of invasion,
insurrection, rebellion or imminent danger thereof, as the "intermittent sorties
and lightning attacks by organized bands in different places are occasional,
localized and transitory," this Court explained that to the unpracticed
eye the repeated encounters between dissident elements and military troops may
seem sporadic, isolated, or casual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the officers charged with the Nation's security, analyzed the extent and
pattern of such violent clashes and arrived at the conclusion that they were
warp and woof of a general scheme to overthrow the government "<i>vi et <span class="SpellE">armis</span></i>, by force of arms." This Court then
reiterated one of the reasons why the finding of the Chief Executive that there
is "actual danger of rebellion" was accorded conclusiveness,
thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Indeed, as Justice Johnson
said in that decision, whereas the Executive branch of the Government is
enabled thru its civil and military branches to obtain information about peace
and order from every quarter and corner of the nation, the judicial department,
with its very limited machinery can not be in better position to ascertain or evaluate
the conditions prevailing in the Archipelago." (<st1:country-region><st1:place><i>Montenegro</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i>

asserted its authority to review the action taken by the State Governor of
Texas under his proclamation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Court chose not to overturn the principle expressed in <i>Moyer
vs. Peabody</i> that the question of necessity is "one strictly reserved
for executive discretion." It held that, while the declaration of <i>necessity</i>
is conclusive, the measures employed are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"It does not follow from the fact that the executive has this
range of discretion, deemed to be a necessary incident of his power to suppress
disorder that every sort of action the Governor may take, no matter how
unjustified by the exigency or subversive of private right and the jurisdiction
of the courts, otherwise available, is conclusively supported by mere executive
fiat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contrary is
well-established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What are the limits of
military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a
particular case, are judicial questions. . ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This ruling in <st1:city><st1:place><i>Sterling</i></st1:place></st1:city>
should be viewed within the context of its factual environment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At issue was the validity of the attempt of
the Governor to enforce by executive or military order the restriction on the
production of oil wells which the District Judge had restrained pending proper
judicial inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The state Governor
predicated his power under martial law, although it was conceded that "at
no time has there been any actual uprising in the territory; at no time has any
military force been exerted to put riots and mobs down." The Court
disapproved the order of the Governor as it had no relation to the suppression
of disorder but on the contrary it undermined the restraining order of the
District Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court declared that
the Governor could not bypass the processes of constitutional government by
simply declaring martial law when no <i>bona fide</i> emergency existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this case shows that the judiciary can
interfere when<i> no circumstances</i> existed which could reasonably be
interpreted as constituting an emergency, it did not necessarily resolve the
question whether the Court could interfere in the face of an <i>actual

<p class="BODY">Our attention is, however, invited to <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
<i>vs</i>. Garcia (G.R. No. L-33964 etc., December 11, 1971, 42 SCRA 448) where
this Court declared, in connection with the suspension of the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> by the President of the Philippines on August 21,
1971, that it has the authority to inquire into the existence of the factual
basis of the proclamation in order to determine the constitutional sufficiency
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this assertion of authority
is qualified by the Court's unequivocal statement that "the function of
the Court is merely to check — not to <i>supplant</i> — the Executive, or <i>to
ascertain merely whether he has gone beyond the constitutional limits </i>of
his jurisdiction,<i> not to exercise the power vested in him</i> or to
determine the wisdom of his act." And "that judicial inquiry into the
basis of the questioned proclamation can go no further than to satisfy the
Court not that the President's decision is correct and that public safety was
endangered by the rebellion and justified the suspension of the writ, but that
in suspending the writ, the President did not act <i>arbitrarily</i>."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the ascertainment of the factual basis of the suspension,
however, the Court had to rely implicitly on the findings of the Chief
Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not conduct any
independent factual inquiry for, as this Court explained in <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span>
and Montenegro, ". . . whereas the Executive branch of the Government is
enabled thru its civil and military branches to obtain information about peace
and order from every quarter and corner of the nation, the judicial department,
with its very limited machinery cannot be in a better position to ascertain or
evaluate the conditions prevailing in the Archipelago." Indeed, such
reliance on the Executive's findings would be the more compelling when the
danger posed to the public safety is one arising from Communist rebellion and
subversion.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can take judicial notice of the fact that the Communists have
refined their techniques of revolution, but the ultimate object is the same —

through well-planned and ably directed insurrection."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
Instead of insurrection, there was to be the protracted war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plan was to retreat and attack only at an
opportune time. "The major objective is the annihilation of the enemy's

</span>Modern rebellion now is a war of sabotage and harassment, of an

real such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil

allowable limits of the martial law powers of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, the limiting force of the <i>Milligan</i> case was

are open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion admitted that
the Courts <i>were open</i> but held "that the governor's declaration that
a state of insurrection existed is conclusive of that fact." Although It
found that the "Governor, without sufficient reason, but in <i>good faith</i>,
in the course of putting the insurrection down, held the plaintiff until he
thought that he could safely release him," the Court held that plaintiff
Moyer had no cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stating
that the Governor was empowered to employ the National Guard to suppress
insurrection, the Court further declared that "he may kill persons who
resist, and of course he may use the milder measure of seizing the bodies of
those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such arrests are not necessarily for
punishment, <i>but are by way of precaution, to prevent the exercise of hostile</i>
power." "So long as such arrests are made in good faith and in the
honest belief that they are needed in order to head the insurrection off, the
Governor is the <i>final judge and cannot be subjected to an action after he is
out of office on the ground that he had no reasonable ground for his belief</i>
. . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it comes to a decision by the
head of state upon a matter involving its life, <i>the ordinary rights of the

enjoyment of such rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
from this view of the nature of martial law, the power is to be exercised not

but also to prevent the recurrence of the very causes which necessitated the
declaration of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Your
Honor, I believe that when President Marcos, to cite the domestic experience,
declared that he proclaimed martial law to save the Republic and to form a New
Society, he was stating the full course which martial law must have to take in
order to achieve its rational end.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because in the particular case of the Philippine situation, I agree with
the President that it is not enough that we be able to quell the rebellion and
the lawlessness, but that we should also be able to eliminate the many ills and
evils in society which have, in the first place, bred and abetted the rebellion
and the lawlessness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I agree with you wholeheartedly, <span class="GramE">Your</span>
Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
seems, Your Honor that we are revolutionizing the traditional concept of
martial law which is commonly understood as a weapon to combat lawlessness and
rebellion through the use of the military authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If my understanding is correct, Your Honor,
martial law is essentially the substitution of military power for civilian
authorities in areas where such civilian authorities are unable to discharge
their functions due to the disturbed peace and order conditions therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But with your explanation Your Honor, it
seems that the martial law administrator, even if he has in the meantime
succeeded in quelling the immediate threats to the security of the state, could
take measures no longer in the form of military operations but essentially and
principally of the nature of ameliorative social action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor is correct when he said that we are
abandoning the narrow, traditional and classic concept of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we are abandoning the same only to
humanize it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Your Honor will recall
that the old concept of martial law is that the law of the camp is the law of
the land, which we are not ready to accept; and President Marcos, aware as he
is, that the Filipino people will not countenance any suppressive and unjust
action, rightly seeks not only to immediately quell and break the back of the
rebel elements but to form a New Society, to create a new atmosphere which will
not be a natural habitat of discontent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, the concept of martial law, as now being practiced, is
not only to restore peace and order in the streets and in the towns but to
remedy the social and political environments in such a way that discontent will
not once more be renewed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE ORTIZ (R.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can feel from the discussion, Mr. Chairman,
that we are having difficulty in trying to ascertain the scope and limitations
of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, Mr.
Chairman, it is constitutionally impossible for us to place in this great
document, in black and white, the limits and the extent of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are framing a Constitution and not a
statute; and unlike a statute, a Constitution must limit itself to providing basic
concepts and policies without going into details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard from some of the Delegates here
their concern that we might be, by this provision and the interpretations being
given to it, departing from the traditional concept of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concepts are mere concepts, Mr. Chairman; but
concepts, like principles, must be tested by their application to existing
conditions, whether those concepts are contained in statutes or in a
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Referring specifically to
the exercise of this power by President Marcos, doubts have been expressed in
some quarters, whether in declaring martial law, he could exercise legislative
and judicial powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would want to
emphasize that the circumstances which provoked the President in declaring
martial law may not be quantified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, it is completely different from a case of invasion where the threat to
national security comes from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The martial law declared by the President was occasioned by the acts of
rebellion, subversion, lawlessness and chaos that are widespread in the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their origin, therefore, is
internal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no threat from
without, but only from within.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these
acts of lawlessness, rebellion, and subversion are mere manifestations of more
serious upheavals that beset the deepest core of our social order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we shall limit and constrict martial law
to its traditional concept, in the sense that the military will be merely
called upon to discharge civilian functions in areas where the civil
functionaries are not in a position to perform their normal duties or, better
still, to quell lawlessness and restore peace and order, then martial law would
be a mere temporary palliative and we shall helpless if bound by the old maxim
that martial law is the public law of military necessity, that necessity calls
it forth, that necessity justifies its existence, and necessity measures the
extent and degrees to which it may be employed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My point here, Your Honor, is that beyond martial necessity lies the
graver problem of solving the maladies which, in the first place, brought about
the conditions which precipitated the exercise of his martial powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the President, by the exercise of his
martial authority, will be limited to merely taking a military measure to quell
the rebellion and eliminating lawlessness in the country and leave him with no
means or authority to effect the needed social and economic reforms to create
an enduring condition of peace and order, then we shall have failed in
providing in this Constitution the basic philosophy of martial law which, I am
sure, we are embodying in it for the great purpose of preserving the
State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say that the preservation of
the State is not limited merely to eliminating the threats that immediately
confront it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than that, the measure
to preserve the State must go deeper into the root causes of the social
disorder that endanger the general safety.</blockquote>

GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution is not set
aside, but the operation of some of its provisions must, of necessity, be
restricted, if not suspended, because their continuance is inconsistent with
the proclamation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance,
some civil liberties will have to be suspended upon the proclamation of martial
law, not because we do not value them, but simply because it is impossible to
implement these civil liberties hand-in-hand with the effective and successful
exercise and implementation of martial powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are certain individual rights which must be restricted and
curtailed because their exercise and enjoyment would negate the implementation
of martial authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preservation
of the State and its Constitution stands paramount over certain individual
rights and freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it were, the
Constitution provides martial law as its weapon for survival, and when the
occasion arises, when such is at stake, prudence requires that certain
individual rights must have to be sacrificed temporarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed, the destruction of the
Constitution would mean the destruction of all the rights that flow from it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that case, Your Honor, I take it that when martial law is proclaimed,
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus </i>is<i> ipso facto</i> suspended
and, therefore, if you are apprehended and detained by the military
authorities, more so, when your apprehension and detention were for an offense
against the security of the State, then you cannot invoke the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and ask the courts to order your temporary
release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, like some other individual rights, must have to yield to the
greater need of preserving the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, we have to make a choice between two values, and I say that in
times of great peril, when the very safety of the whole nation and this
Constitution is at stake, we have to elect for the greater one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as I have said, individual rights assume
meaning and importance only when their exercise could be guaranteed by the
State, and such guaranty cannot definitely be had unless the State is in a
position to assert and enforce its authority.</blockquote>

powers as Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When martial

strictly executive in character, but nonetheless necessary and incident to the
assumption of martial law authority to the end that the State may be safe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
not at all questioning the constitutionality of the President's assumption of
powers which are not strictly <span class="GramE">executive</span> in

when martial law is declared, the President can exercise certain judicial and
legislative powers which are essential to or which have to do with the quelling
of rebellion, insurrection, imminent danger thereof, or meeting an
invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What appears disturbing to me,
and which I want Your Honor to convince me further, is the exercise and
assumption by the President or by the Prime Minister of powers, either
legislative or judicial in character, which have nothing to do with the
conditions of rebellion, insurrection, invasion or imminent danger
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more specific, <span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor, and to cite to you an example, I have in mind
the decree issued by the President proclaiming a nationwide land reform or

matter, has nothing to do with invasion, insurrection, rebellion or imminent
danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My point, Your Honor, is
that this measure basically has nothing to do with the restoration of peace and
order or the quelling of rebellion or insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could we validly say that the President's
assumption of such powers is justified by the proclamation of martial law?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city> <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place>
GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I have repeatedly
stated, Your Honor, we have now to abandon the traditional concept of martial
law as it is understood in some foreign textbooks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to look at martial law not as an
immutable principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, we must
view it in the light of our contemporary experience and not in isolation
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quelling of rebellion or
lawlessness or, in other words, the restoration of peace and order may
admittedly be said to be the immediate objective of martial law, but that is to
beg the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For how could there
really be an enduring peace and order if the very causes which spawned the
conditions which necessitated the exercise of martial powers are not remedied?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You cite as an example the decree on land
reform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor will have to admit
that one of the major causes of social unrest among the peasantry in our
society is the deplorable treatment society has given to our peasants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as the 1930's, the peasants have
been agitating for agrarian reforms to the extent that during the time of
President <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> they almost succeeded in
overthrowing the government by force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were we to adopt the traditional concept of martial law, we would be
confined to merely putting down one peasant uprising after another, leaving
unsolved the maladies that in the main brought forth those uprisings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we are really to establish an enduring
condition of peace and order and assure through the ages the stability of our Constitution
and the Republic, I say that martial law, being the ultimate weapon of survival
provided for in the Constitution, must penetrate deeper and seek to alleviate
and cure the ills and the seething furies deep in the bowels of the social
structure. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In a very real sense,
therefore, there is a profound relationship between the exercise by the martial
law administrator of legislative and judicial powers and the ultimate objective
of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I may add that in
the ultimate analysis, the only known limitation to martial law powers is the
convenience of the martial law administrator and the judgment and verdict of
the people and, of course, the verdict of history itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE LEVISTE (O):<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor, just for purposes of discussion, may I know from
you whether there has been an occasion in this country where any past President
had made use of his martial law power?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am glad that you asked that question, Your Honor, because it seems
that we are of the impression that since its incorporation into the 1935
Constitution, the martial law provision has never been availed of by any
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I recall, Your Honor, that
during the Japanese occupation, President Laurel had occasion to declare
martial law, and I recall that when President Laurel declared martial law, he
also assumed legislative and judicial powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We must, of course, realize that during the time of President Laurel,
the threats to national security which precipitated the declaration came from
the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The threats, therefore,
were not internal in origin and character as those which prompted President
Marcos to issue his historic proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, in case — as what happened during the time of President Laurel — the
declaration of martial law necessitated the exercise of legislative powers by
the martial law administrator, I say that greater necessity calls forth the
exercise of that power when the threats to national security are posed not by
invaders but by the rebellious and seditious elements, both of the left and
right, from within.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say that because
every rebellion, whether in this country or in other foreign countries, is
usually the product of social unrest and dissatisfaction with the established
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebellions or the acts of
rebellion are usually preceded by long suffering of those who ultimately choose
to rise in arms against the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A rebellion is not born overnight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the result of an accumulation of social sufferings on the part of
the rebels until they can no longer stand those sufferings to the point that,
like a volcano, it must sooner erupt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this context, the stamping out of rebellion must not be the main and only
objective of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The martial
law administrator should, nay, must, take steps to remedy the crises that lie
behind the rebellious movement, even if in the process, he should exercise
legislative and judicial powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
what benefit would it be after having put down a rebellion through the exercise
of martial power if another rebellion is again in the offing because the root
causes which propelled the movement are ever present?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One might succeed in capturing the rebel
leaders and their followers, imprison them for life or, better still, kill them
in the field, but someday new leaders will pick up the torch and the tattered
banners and lead another movement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Great
causes of every human undertaking do not usually die with the men behind those
causes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless the root causes are
themselves eliminated, there will be a resurgence of another rebellion and,
logically, the endless and vicious exercise of martial law authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This reminds me of the wise words of an old
man in our town:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That if you are going
to clear your field of weeds and grasses, you should not merely cut them, but
dig them out.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><i>POLITICAL QUESTION<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">We have adverted to one fact that our jurisprudence attests
abundantly to the existence of a continuing Communist rebellion and subversion,
and on this point there can hardly be any dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The narrow question, therefore, presented for
resolution is whether the determination by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the <i>necessity</i> for the exercise of his constitutional power to declare
martial law is subject to judicial review.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In resolving the question, <span class="GramE">We</span> re-affirm the
view that the determination of the <i>necessity</i> for the exercise of the
power to declare martial law is within the exclusive domain of the President,
and his determination is final and conclusive upon the courts and upon all
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion necessarily
results from the fact that the very nature of the executive decision is
political, not judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision as
to whether or not there is <i>necessity for the exercise of the power is wholly
confided by our Constitution to the Chief Executive</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For such decision, he is directly responsible
to the people for whose welfare he is obliged to act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the nature of the responsibility
reposed upon him, it is essential that he be accorded freedom of action
demanded by the exigency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power is
to be exercised upon sudden emergencies and under circumstances vital to the
existence of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue is
committed to him for determination by criteria of political and military
expediency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not pretended to rest
on evidence but on information which may not be acceptable in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, therefore, no standards
ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which
his decision can be judicially reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, his decision is of a kind for which the judiciary has <span class="GramE">neither the aptitude, facilities nor responsibility to undertake</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are unwilling to give our assent to
expressions of opinion which, although not intended, tends to cripple the
constitutional powers of the government in dealing promptly and effectively
with the danger to the public safety posed by the rebellion and Communist
subversion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the Court is without power to shape measures for
dealing with the problems of society, much less with the suppression of
rebellion or Communist subversion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
nature of judicial power is largely negative, and it is essential that the
opportunity of the Chief Executive for well-directed positive action in dealing
with the problem be preserved, if the Government is to serve the best interests
of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, as a consequence
of the general referendum of July 27-28, 1973, where 18,052,016 citizens voted
overwhelmingly for the continuance of President Marcos in office beyond 1973 to
enable him to finish the reforms he had instituted under martial law, the
question of the legality of the proclamation of martial law, and its
continuance, had undoubtedly been removed from judicial intervention.</p>

valid and constitutional, the arrest and detention of petitioners, pursuant to
General Order No. 2 dated September 22, 1972 of the President, as amended by
General Order No. 2-A, dated September 26, 1972, may not now be assailed as

Order No. 2 directed the Secretary of National Defense to arrest "individuals

inimical or injurious to our people, the government and our national

<p class="BODY">It should be important to note that as a consequence of the
proclamation of martial law, the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
has been impliedly suspended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Authoritative writers on the subject view the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus as an incident, but an important incident of a declaration of martial

<blockquote>"The suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is not, in

the essence of martial law is the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">General Order No. 2 was issued to
implement the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> provisions of the

<p class="BODY">By the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, the judiciary is precluded from interfering with the orders of the
Executive by inquiring into the legality of the detention of persons involved
in the rebellion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arrest and detention of persons reasonably believed to be
engaged in, or connected with, the insurgency are predicated upon the principle
that in time of public disorder it is the right and duty of all citizens
especially the officer entrusted with the enforcement of the law to employ such
force as may be necessary to preserve the peace and restrain those who may be
committing felonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Encroachments upon
personal liberty, as well as upon private property on those occasions are
justified by the necessity of preserving order and the greater interests of the
political community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief
Executive, upon whom is reposed the duty to preserve the nation in those times
of national peril, has correspondingly the right to exercise broad authority
and discretion compatible with the emergency in selecting the means and
adopting the measures which, in his honest judgment, are necessary for the
preservation of the nation's safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
case of rebellion or insurrection, the Chief Executive may "use the milder
measure of seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of
restoring peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such arrests are not
necessarily for punishment but are by way of precaution, to prevent the
exercise of hostile power." <span class="GramE">(<i>Moyer v. Peabody,</i>
212 U.S. 78, 84-85 [1909] 53 L. ed. 411.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The justification for the preventive detention of individuals is
that in a crisis such as invasion or domestic insurrection "the danger to
the security of nation and its institutions is so great that the government
must take measures that temporarily deprive citizens of certain rights in order
to ensure the survival of the political structure that protects those and other
rights during ordinary times." <span class="GramE">(<i>Developments

<p class="BODY">In <i>Moyer v. </i><st1:city><st1:place><i>Peabody</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>,
supra</i>, the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> upheld the detention of a labor
leader whose mere presence in the area of a violent labor dispute was deemed
likely to incite further disturbances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"So long as such arrests are made in good faith," said the
erudite Justice Holmes, "and in the honest belief that they are made in
order to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and can not
be subjected to an action after he is out of office, on the ground that he had
no reasonable ground for his belief."</p>

<p class="BODY">During World War II, persons of Japanese ancestry were evacuated
from their homes in the West Coast and interned in the interior until the
loyalty of each individual could be established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><i>Korematsu</i></span><i>
v. United States</i> (323 U.S. 214 [244]), the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> upheld the exclusion of these persons
on the ground that among them a substantial number were likely to be disloyal
and that, therefore, the presence of the entire group created the risk of
sabotage and espionage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the
Court avoided deciding the constitutionality of the detention that followed the
evacuation, its separation of the issue of exclusion from that of detention was
artificial, since the separate orders were part of a single over-all
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasoning behind its
approval of exclusion of persons of Japanese ancestry would seem to apply with
equal force to the detention despite the greater restrictions of movement that
the latter entailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <st1:place>Middle
 East</st1:place>, military authorities of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have detained suspected Arab terrorists without trial (<span class="SpellE">Dershowitz</span>,<i>
Terrorism and Preventive Detention:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Case of Israel</i>, 50 Commentaries, Dec. 1970 at 78).</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the most effective countermeasures adopted by governments
in <st1:place>Southeast Asia</st1:place> to prevent the growth of Communist
power has been the arrest and detention without trial of key united front
leaders at suitable times.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The preventive detention of persons reasonably believed to be
involved in the Communist rebellion and subversion has long been recognized by
all democratic governments as a necessary emergency measure for restoring
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Because of the difficulty
in piercing the secrecy of tightly knit subversive organizations in order to
determine which individuals are <b>responsible</b> for the violence,
governments have occasionally responded to emergencies marked by the threat or
reality of sabotage or terrorism by detaining persons on the ground that they
are dangerous and will probably engage in such actions."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
(L-35546) has already been charged with the violation of the Anti-Subversion
Act (L-37364) and therefore his detention is reasonably related to the quelling
of the rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
the other petitioners have been released but their movements are subject to
certain restrictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restrictions
on the freedom of movement of these petitioners, as a condition for their
release, are, however, required by considerations of national security.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> In
the absence of war or rebellion, the right to travel within the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may be considered constitutionally protected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even under such circumstances that freedom is not absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Areas ravaged by floods, fire and pestilence
can be quarantined, as unlimited travel to those areas may directly and
materially interfere with the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the area
affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During a rebellion or
insurrection the authority of the commander to issue and enforce police
regulations in the area of the rebellion or insurrection is well
recognized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such regulations may involve
the limitation of the right of assembly, the right to keep arms, and
restrictions on freedom of movement of civilians.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>
Undoubtedly, measures conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency and
directly related to the quelling of the disorder fall within the discretion of
the President, in the exercise of his authority to suppress the rebellion and
restore public order.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no basis, therefore, for concluding that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> continued detention and the restrictions imposed
on the movements of the other petitioners who were released, are arbitrary.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><i>C O N C L U S I O N<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">We realize the transcendental importance of these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beyond the question of deprivation of liberty
of petitioners is the necessity of laying at rest any doubt on the validity of
the institutional changes made to bring the country out of an era of rebellion,
near political anarchy and economic stagnation and to establish the foundation
of a truly democratic government and a just and compassionate society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as a respected delegate of two
Constitutional <span class="SpellE">Coventions</span> observed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The introduction of martial law has
been a necessary recourse to restore order and steer the country safely though
a severe economic and social crisis."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> The exercise of these extraordinary
powers not only to restore civil order thru military force but also to effect
urgently needed reforms in order to root out the causes of the rebellion and
Communist subversion may indeed <span class="GramE">be</span> an experiment in
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it was necessary if the
national democratic institution was to survive in competition with the more
revolutionary types of government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"National democratic constitutionalism, ancient though its origin
may be," observed Dr. C.F. Strong,<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> "is still in an experimental
stage and if it is to survive in competition with more revolutionary types of
government, we must be prepared to adapt to ever-changing conditions of modern
existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic purpose of a
political institution is, after all, the same wherever it appears:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to secure social peace and progress,
safeguard individual rights, and promote national well-­being."</p>

<p class="BODY">These adaptations and innovations were resorted to in order to
realize the social values that constitute the professed goals of the democratic
polity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an attempt to make the
political institution serve as an effective instrument of economic and social
development.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The need of the times was
for a more effective mode of decision-making and policy-formulation to enable
the nation to keep pace with the revolutionary changes that were inexorably
reshaping Philippine Society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
government, observed the then Delegate Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
a Member of the Sub-Committee of Seven of the Sponsorship Committee of the 1934
Constitutional Convention, "is a practical science, not a theory, and a
government can be successful only if in its structure due consideration is
given to the habits, the customs, the character and, as McKinley said, to the
idiosyncrasies of the people."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

in the same article, provides us with a definition of Mao's strategy
revolutionary warfare, the strategy of people's war which comprises the
following six major elements:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span class="GramE">"(1) <i>Leadership by a revolutionary communist party</i>
which will properly apply Marxism-Leninism in analyzing the class character of
a colonial or <span class="SpellE">semicolonial</span> country, and which can
formulate correct policy to wage a protracted war against imperialism,
feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.</span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">"(2) <i>Correct
utilization of the united front policy</i> to build the broadest possible
national united front to ensure the fullest mobilization of the basic masses as
well as the unity of all the forces that can be united, in an effort to take
over the leadership of the national revolution and establish the revolution on
an alliance of, first, the workers and peasants and, second, an alliance of the
working peoples with the bourgeoisie and other non-working people.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">"(3) <i>Reliance
on the peasantry and the establishment of rural bases</i>, because in agrarian
and '<span class="SpellE">semifeudal</span>' societies the peasants are the great
majority of the population; 'subjected to threefold oppression and exploitation
by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism' they will provide most of
the human and material resources for the revolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In essence, the revolution is a peasant
revolution led by the communist party:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'to rely on the peasants, build rural base areas and use the countryside
to encircle and finally capture the cities — such was the way to victory in the
Chinese revolution.'</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">"(4) <i>Creation
of a communist party-led army of a new type</i>, for a 'universal truth of
Marxism-Leninism' is that 'without a people's army the people have nothing.' A
new type of communist party-led army in which 'politics is the commander' must
be formed, one which focuses on instilling in the minds of the population a
'proletarian revolutionary consciousness and <span class="SpellE">courrage</span>'
and which actively seeks the 'support and backing of the masses.'</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">"(5) <i>Use
of the strategy and tactics of the people's war</i> as interpreted by Mao <span class="SpellE">Tse-tung</span>, in a protracted armed struggle to annihilate the
enemy and take over state power, based on the support of a mobilized mass
population and the use of guerrilla warfare, and ultimately mobile and even
positional warfare as the revolution progresses."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">"(6)<i>
Adherence to a policy of self-reliance</i>, because 'revolution or people's war
in any country is the business of the masses in that country and should be
carried out primarily by their own efforts; and there is no other way.'" <span class="GramE">(Peter Van Ness, <i>Revolution and Chinese Foreign Policy</i>, pp.

<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref37" name="_ftn37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> During the Civil War in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the writ of habeas corpus was
suspended and many thousands of persons suspected of disloyalty to the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
were interned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(J. Randall &amp; D.
Donald, <span class="GramE"><i>The</i></span><i> Civil War and Reconstruction,</i>
301 [1961].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that the
Habeas Corpus Act of 1863 of the United States required that lists of political
prisoners be furnished to the judges of the federal courts; limited the
duration of detention to one session of the grand jury, at the end of which
courts were to order the release of those prisoners who had not been indicted
for a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, during the Civil
War the Habeas Corpus Act was virtually ignored by President Lincoln, and the
arrest, confinement, and release of prisoners continued as if it had not been
passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">[Lee], Randall

<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref38" name="_ftn38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> There are three reasons advanced why this was found
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"First, the evidence to
satisfy the requirements of legal procedure will blow the cover of police
agents who have penetrated Communist open-front organizations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the possibility of prosecution
assumes that participation in Communist conspiratorial activities is a legal
offence, which it is not in most countries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Third, to wait for the Communist activist to engage in overtly illegal
action, for example, riots and other sorts of violence before <span class="GramE">prosecution,</span> will give them a political advantage which few
governments of the new states of <st1:place>Asia</st1:place> can afford.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For by then the political situation would
have deteriorated to a state of acute instability, which in turn would probably
have caused economic decline due to loss of confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should political instability become endemic,
serious doubts will creep into men's minds as to who would emerge the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can make the problem of control of
subversion, for which public confidence and co-operation are important, a very
acute one.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">"The power of arrest and
detention without trial is, therefore, a necessary weapon in the fight against
Communists in the newly established Asian states.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, of the utmost importance that
the highest standards of conduct the on the part of the secret police are
maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should checks, in the
form of review committees consisting of lawyers and professional men, on the
actions of the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These checks
should be real and not perfunctory measures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing would be more <span class="SpellE">favourable</span> to the growth
of Communist influence than extensive and indiscriminate use of the powers of
detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For this
will generally cause widespread resentment against the authorities which the Communist
underground can use to stoke the fires of revolution.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, it is important that police action
is limited to really worthwhile targets — the thinkers and the planners, the
able propagandists and the organization men.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ninety-nine per cent of those who engage in Communist open-front
activities are not worth detaining, not even the second echelon activists and
the musclemen on whom the Communists depend to discipline their followers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are the expendables and can be replaced
without much difficulty, unlike the thinker and the plotter, and their
detention serves no purpose beyond creating unnecessary disaffection among
their families." (<span class="SpellE">Goh</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to my mind very unfortunate that, for reasons I cannot
comprehend or do not deem convincing, the majority of the Court has agreed that
no main opinion be prepared for the decision in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Honestly, I feel that the grounds given by
the Chief Justice do not justify a deviation from the regular practice of a
main opinion being prepared by one Justice even when the members of the Court
are not all agreed as to the grounds of the judgment as long as at least a
substantial number of Justices concur in the basic ones and there are enough
other Justices concurring in the result to form the required majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not see such varying substantial
disparity in the views of the members of the Court regarding the different
issues here as to call for a summarization like the one that was done, with
controversial consequences, in Javellana.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(a)</span></span></a> Actually, the summarization made
by the Chief Justice does not in my opinion portray accurately the spectrum of
our views, if one is to assay the doctrinal value of this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The divergences stated are I think more
apparent than real.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, it is my considered view that a historical decision
like this, one likely to be <i>sui generis</i>, at the same time that it is of
utmost transcendental importance because it revolves around the proper
construction of the constitutional provisions securing individual rights as
they may be affected by those empowering the Government to defend itself
against the threat of internal and external aggression, as these are actually
operating in the setting of the official proclamation of the Executive that
rebellion endangering public safety actually exists, deserves better treatment
from the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, I believe that
our point of seeming variance respecting the questions, before us could have
been threshed out, if only enough effort in that direction had been exerted by
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trouble is that from the very
beginning many members of the Court, myself included, announced our desire to
have our views recorded for history, hence, individualization rather than
consensus became the order of the day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In consequence, the convenient solution was forged that as long as there
would be enough votes to support a legally binding, judgment, here need not be
any opinion of the Court, everyone could give his own views and the Chief
Justice would just try to analyze the opinions of those who would care to
prepare one and then make a certification, of the final result of the voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only at the last minute that, at my
suggestion, supported by Justice Castro, the Chief's prepared certification was
modified to assume the form of a judgment, thereby giving this decision a
better semblance of respectability.</p>

<p class="BODY">As will be seen, this separate opinion of concurrence is not due
to any irreconcilable conflict of conviction between me and any other member of
the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, at the early
stages of our efforts to decide these cases, but after the Court had more or
less already arrived at a consensus as to the result, I was made to understand
that I could prepare the opinion for the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, however, for one reason or another, some of our colleagues
felt that it is unnecessary to touch on certain matters contained in the draft
I had submitted, incomplete and unedited as it was, hence, the plan was
abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My explanation that a
decision of this import should be addressed in part to the fixture and should
attempt to answer, as best we can, not only the questions raised by the parties
but also the relevant ones that we are certain are bothering many of our
countrymen, not to speak of those who are interested in the correct juridical
implications of the unusual political developments being witnessed in the
Philippines these days, failed to persuade them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still feel very strongly, however, the need
for articulating the thoughts that will enable the whole world to visualize and
comprehend the exact length, breadth and depth of the juridical foundations of
the current constitutional order and thus be better positioned to render its
verdict thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following then is the draft of the opinion I prepared for the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel I need not adjust it to
give it the tenor of an individual opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Something inside me dictates that I should let it stand as I had
originally prepared it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am emboldened
to do this by the conviction that actually, when properly analyzed, it will be
realized that whatever differences there might be in the various opinions we
are submitting individually, such differences lie only in the distinctive
methods of approach we have each prepared to adopt rather than in any basically
substantial and irreconcilable disagreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If we had only striven a little more, I am confident, we could have even
found a common mode of approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
referring, of course, only to those of Us who sincerely feel the urgency of
resolving the fundamental issues herein, regardless of purely technical and
strained reasons there might be to apparently justify an attitude of
indifference, if not concealed antagonism, to the need for authoritative
judicial clarification of the juridical aspects of the New Society in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner Diokno was released by order of the President, "under existing
rules and regulations." The Court has, therefore, resolved that his
particular case has become moot and academic, but this development has not
affected the issues insofar as the other petitioners, particularly Senator
Aquino, are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And inasmuch as
the principal arguments of petitioner Diokno, although presented only in the
pleadings filed on his behalf, apply with more or less equal force to the other
petitioners, I feel that my reference to and discussion of said arguments in my
draft may well be preserved, if only to maintain the purported
comprehensiveness of my treatment of all the important aspects of these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding any further, however, I would like to explain
why I am saying we have no basic disagreements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Except for Justices Makasiar and Esguerra who consider the
recitals in the Proclamation to be absolutely conclusive upon the courts and
for Justice Teehankee who considers it unnecessary to express any opinion on
the matter at this point, the rest or eight of us have actually inquired into
the constitutional sufficiency of the Proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where we have differed is only as to the
extent and basis of the inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without
committing themselves expressly as to whether the issue is justiciable or
otherwise, the Chief Justice and Justice Castro unmistakably appear to have
actually conducted an inquiry which as far as I can see is based on facts which
are uncontradicted in the record plus additional facts of judicial notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No independent evidence has been considered,
nor is any reference made to the evidence on which the President had
acted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their part, Justices Antonio,
Fernandez and Aquino are of the view that the Proclamation is not subject to
inquiry by the courts, but assuming it is, they are of the conviction that the
record amply supports the reasonableness, or lack of arbitrariness, of the
President's action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, in arriving
at this latter conclusion, they have relied exclusively on the same factual
bases utilized by the Chief Justice and Justice Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justices Fernando and Muñoz Palma
categorically hold that the issue is justiciable and, on that premise, they
made their own inquiry, but with no other basis than the same undisputed facts
in the record and facts of judicial notice from which the others have drawn
their conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For myself, I am just
making it very clear that the inquiry which the Constitution contemplates for
the determination of the constitutional sufficiency of a proclamation of
martial law by the President should not go beyond facts of judicial notice and
those that may be stated in the proclamation, if these are by their very nature
capable of unquestionable demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, eight of us virtually hold that the Executive's
Proclamation is not absolutely conclusive — but it is not to be interfered with
whenever it accords with facts undisputed in the record as well as those of
judicial notice or capable of unquestionable demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is obvious that although we are
split between upholding justiciability or non-justiciability, those who believe
in the latter have nonetheless conducted an inquiry, while those who adhere to
the former theory, insisting on following Lansang, have limited their inquiry
to the uncontroverted facts and facts of judicial notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the truth is that no one has asked
for inquiry into the evidence before the President which is what the real
import of justiciability means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
final analysis, none of us has gone beyond what in my humble opinion the
Constitution permits in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, while a declaration of martial law is not absolutely conclusive,
the Court's inquiry into its constitutional sufficiency may not, contrary to
what is implied in Lansang, involve the reception of evidence to be weighed
against those on which the President has acted, nor may it extend to the
investigation of what evidence the President had before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such inquiry must be limited to what is
undisputed in the record and to what accords or does not accord with facts of
judicial notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following now is my separate concurring opinion which as I have
said is the draft I submitted to the Court's approval:</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a cluster of petitions for habeas corpus seeking the
release of petitioners from detention, upon the main ground that, allegedly,
Proclamation 1081 issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos on September 21, 1972
placing the whole country under martial law as well as the general orders
subsequently issued also by the President by virtue of the said proclamation,
pursuant to which petitioners have been apprehended and detained, two of them
until the present, while the rest have been released conditionally, are
unconstitutional and null and void, hence their arrest and detention have no
legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in G.R. No. L-35538 are all journalist, namely,
Joaquin P. Roces, Teodoro M. Locsin, Rolando Fadul, Rosalind Galang, Go Eng
Guan, Maximo M. Soliven, Renato Constantino and Luis R. Mauricio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their petition was filed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September
 23, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Almost three hours later of the same day, the petition in G.R.
No. L-35539 was filed, with Carmen I. Diokno, as petitioner, acting on behalf
of her husband, Jose W. Diokno, a senator, who is one of those still detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two days later, early in the morning of <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1972</st1:date>, the petition of Maximo V.
Soliven, Napoleon G. Rama and Jose Mari Velez, all media men, was docketed as
G.R. No. L-35540.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last two were also
delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all the three foregoing cases, the proper writs of habeas
corpus were issued returnable not later than <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1972</st1:date>,
and hearing of the petitions was held on <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1972</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Late in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1972</st1:date>, another petition was filed on behalf of Senators Benigno
S. Aquino, Jr. and Ramon V. Mitra, Jr., and former Senator Francisco
"Soc" Rodrigo, also a TV commentator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Delegate Napoleon Rama also appears as petitioner in this case.) It was
docketed as G.R. No. L-35546.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="9">September
 26, 1972</st1:date>, a petition was filed by Voltaire Garcia II, another
delegate to the Constitutional Convention, as G.R. No. L-35547.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In these two cases the writs prayed for were also issued and the
petitions were heard together on <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="9">September
 29, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. L-35556, the petition was filed by Tan Chin Hian and
Veronica L. Yuyitung on <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="9">September 27,
 1972</st1:date>, but the same was withdrawn by the latter on <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1972</st1:date> and the former on <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1972</st1:date>, since they were
released from custody on <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September 30,
 1972</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1972</st1:date>,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court allowed the
withdrawals by resolution on <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="10">October
 11, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 2, 1972, the petition of journalists Amando Doronila,
Juan L. Mercado, Hernando J. Abaya, Ernesto Granada, Luis Beltran, Tan Chin
Hian, (already a petitioner in G. R. No. L-35556) Bren Guiao, (for whom a
subsequent petition was also filed by his wife in G. R. No. L-35571, but both
petitions on his behalf were immediately withdrawn with the approval of the
Court which was given by resolution on <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="10">October
 11, 1972</st1:date>) Ruben Cusipag, Roberto Ordoñez, Manuel Almario and Willie
Baun was filed in G.R. No. L-35567.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
these petitioners, except Juan L. Mercado, Manuel Almario and Roberto Ordoñez
withdrew their petitions and the Court allowed the withdrawals by resolutions
of October 3 and 11, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">And on <st1:date year="1972" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1972</st1:date>,
Ernesto Rondon, also a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and a radio
commentator, filed his petition in G.R. No. L-35573.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in all these last four cases, G.R. Nos. L-35556, 35567,
35571 and 35573, the corresponding writs were issued and a<i> </i>joint hearing
of the petitions was held <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10">October 6,
 1972</st1:date>, except as to the petitioners who had as of then announced the

resolution of <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1972</st1:date>,
and later, on <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1972</st1:date>,
an 88-page reply to the memorandum of respondents, with annexes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a separate Manifestation of Compliance and
Submission filed simultaneously with their reply, petitioners stressed that:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That undersigned counsel for Petitioners did
not ask for any extension of the period within which to file the Reply

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>any further delay would only diminish
whatever time is left — more than a month's time — within which this Court can
deliberate on and decide these petitions, having in mind some irreversible
events which may plunge this nation into an entirely new constitutional order,
namely, the approval of the draft of the proposed Constitution by the
Constitutional Convention and the 'plebiscite' scheduled on January 15, 1973;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the proposed Constitution, if 'ratified',
might prejudice these petitions, in view of the following transitory provision:</p>

<p class="2Q">'All proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts
promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President shall be part of the
law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding, and effective even
after the lifting of martial law or the ratification of this Constitution,
unless modified, revoked, or superseded by subsequent proclamations, decrees,
instructions, or other acts of the incumbent President, or unless expressly and
explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article XVII, sec. 3, par. 2 of the proposed
Constitution).</p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the fact that they were arrested
and detained allegedly in keeping with the existing Constitution, it is only
humane and just that these petitions . . . to be accorded preference under Rule
22, section 1 of the Rules of Court . . . be disposed of while there is still
time left, in accordance with the present Constitution and not in accordance
with a new constitutional order being ushered in, under the aegis of a martial
rule, the constitutionality and validity of which is the very point at issue in
the instant petitions;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since, according to the unanimous view of
the authorities, as cited in their Memorandum, the overriding purpose of
martial law is . . . and cannot go beyond . . . the preservation of the <i>constitutional
status quo</i>, and not to alter it or hasten its alteration, it would be
extremely unjust and inhuman, to say the least, to allow these petitions for
the great writ of liberty to be imperiled, by virtue of a new Constitution . .
. 'submission' and 'ratification' of which are being pressed under martial law
. . . that would purportedly ratify all Executive edicts issued and acts done
under said regime . . . something that has never been done as far as is known
in the entire history of the Anglo-American legal system;" (pp. 414­-416,
Rollo, L-35539.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it may be stated that as of October 11, 1972,
the following petitioners had already withdrawn:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amando Doronila, Hernando J. Abaya, Ernesto
Granada, Luis Beltran, Bren Guiao, Ruben Cusipag, Willie Baun, Tan Chin Hian

Carmen Diokno, Napoleon G. Rama, Jose Mari Velez, Benigno S. Aquino, Ramon V.
Mitra, Jr., Francisco S. Rodrigo, Juan L. Mercado, Roberto Ordonez, Manuel
Almario and Ernesto Rondon, but only Senators Diokno and Aquino are still in
confinement, the rest having been released under conditions hereinafter to be
discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of petitioner Garcia
in G.R. No. L-35547 is deemed abated on account of his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over the opposition of these remaining petitioners, respondents
counsel was given several extensions of their period to file their memorandum,
and it was not until <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1973</st1:date>
that they were able to file their reply of 35 pages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previously, their memorandum of 77 pages was
filed on <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the cases were declared submitted for
decision only on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1973</st1:date>,
per resolution of even date, only to be reopened later, as will be stated anon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, practically the same counsel for petitioners in
these cases engaged the government lawyers in another and separate
transcendental judicial tussle of two stages relative to the New
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1972</st1:date>, the first of the so-called
Plebiscite Cases (G.R. No. L-35925, Charito Planas <i>vs</i>. Comelec, G. R.
No. L-35929, Pablo C. Sanidad <i>vs</i>. Comelec, G. R. No. L-35940, Gerardo

Comelec) was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases took
most of the time of the Court until <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1973</st1:date>, when they were declared moot and academic because of the
issuance of Proclamation 1102 on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1973</st1:date>, but on <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1973</st1:date>, as a sequel to the Plebiscite Cases, Josue Javellana
filed Case No. G. R. No. L-36142 against the Executive Secretary and the
Secretaries of National Defense, Justice and Finance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This started the second series of cases known
as the Ratification Cases, namely, said G. R. No. L-36142 and G. R. No.
L-36164, Vidal Tan <i>vs</i>. The Executive Secretary et al., G.R. No. L-­36165,
Gerardo Roxas et al. <i>vs</i>. Alejandro Melchor etc. et al., G. R. No.
L-36236, Eddie B. Monteclaro <i>vs</i>. The Executive Secretary, and G. R. No.
L-36283, Napoleon V. Dilag <i>vs</i>. The Honorable Executive Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main thrust of these petitions was that
the New Constitution had not been validly ratified, hence the Old Constitution
continued in force and, therefore, whatever provisions the New Constitution
might contain tending to validate the proclamations, orders, decrees, and acts
of the incumbent President which are being relied upon for the apprehension and
detention of petitioners, have no legal effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, the advent of a new constitution naturally entailed the
consequence that any question as to the legality of the continued detention of
petitioners or of any restraint of their liberties may not be resolved without
taking into account in one way or another the pertinent provisions of the new
charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the resolution of
these two series of cases became a prejudicial matter which the Court had to
resolved first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until <st1:date year="1973" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1973</st1:date> that they were decided
adversely to the petitioners therein and it was only on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1973</st1:date> that entry of final judgment was
made therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">From <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1973</st1:date>,
the membership of the Court was depleted to nine, in view of the retirement,
effective on said date, of then Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With its nine remaining members, doubts were
expressed as to whether or not the Court could act on constitutional matters of
the nature and magnitude of those raised in these cases, the required quorum
for the resolution of issues of unconstitutionality under the New Constitution
being ten members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 2(2),
Article IX, Constitution of the Philippines of 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescinding from this point, it is a fact
that even if it is not required expressly by the Constitution, by the Court's
own policy which the Constitution authorizes it to adopt, all cases involving
constitutional questions are heard <i>en banc</i> in which the quorum and at
the same time the binding vote is of eight Justices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With only nine members out of a possible
membership of fifteen, it was not exactly fair for all concerned that the Court
should act, particularly in a case which in truth does not involve only those
who are actual parties therein but the whole people as well as the Government
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the Court, even as it went on informally
discussing these cases from time to time, preferred to wait for the appointment
and qualification of new members, which took place only on October 29, 1973,
when Justices Estanislao Fernandez, Cecilia Muñoz Palma and Ramon Aquino joined
the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, subsequent to the resolution of <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1973</st1:date>, declaring these cases
submitted for decision, or, more particularly on <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1973</st1:date>, counsel for petitioner Carmen I. Diokno in
G.R. No. L-35539 filed a 99-page Supplemental Petition and Motion for Immediate
Release which the Court had to refer to the respondents, on whose behalf, the
Solicitor General filed an answer on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 14,
1973, counsel for petitioner Diokno filed a motion asking that the said
petition and motion be set for hearing, which the Court could not do, in view
precisely of the question of quorum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a matter of fact, in the related case of Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. vs. Military
Commission No. 2, et al., G.R. No. L-37364, further reference to which will be
made later, a preliminary hearing had to be held by the Court on <st1:date year="1973" day="24" month="8">Sunday, August 24, 1973</st1:date>, on the sole
question of whether or not with its membership of nine then, the Court could
act on issues of constitutionality of the acts of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it may be mentioned incidentally that thru several
repeated manifestations and motions, Counsel Francis E. Garchitorena of
petitioner Diokno invited the attention of the Court not only to alleged denial
to his client of "the essential access of and freedom to confer and
communicate with counsel" but also to alleged deplorable subhuman
conditions surrounding his detention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in relation to said manifestations and motions, on February 19,
1973, said petitioner, Diokno, together with petitioner Benigno S. Aquino and
joined by their common counsel, Senator Lorenzo M. Tañada, filed with this
Court a petition for mandamus praying that respondents be commanded "to
permit petitioner Tañada to visit and confer freely and actively with
petitioners Diokno and Aquino at reasonable hours pursuant to the provisions of
RA 857 and RA 1083 and in pursuance of such decision, (to direct said
respondents) (1) to clear the conference room of petitioners of all
representatives of the Armed Forces and all unwanted third persons, and
prohibit their presence; (2) to remove or cause the removal of all listening
devices and other similar electronic equipment from the conference room of
petitioners, with the further direction that no such instruments be hereafter
installed, and (3) to desist from the practice of examining (a) the notes taken
by petitioner Tañada of his conferences with petitioners Diokno and Aquino; and
(b) such other legal documents as petitioner Tañada may bring with him for
discussion with said petitioners." (G. R. No. L-36315).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For obvious reasons, said petition will be
resolved in a separate decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may
be stated here, however, that in said G. R. No. L-­36315, in attention to the
complaint made by Senator Tañada in his Reply dated April 2, 1973, that
Mesdames Diokno and Aquino were not being allowed to visit their husbands, and,
worse, their very whereabouts were not being made known to them, on April 6,
1973, after hearing the explanations of counsel for therein respondents, the
Court issued the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon humanitarian considerations, the Court RESOLVED
unanimously to grant, pending further action by this Court, that portion of the
prayer in petitioners' 'Supplement and/or Amendment to Petition' filed on April
6, 1973 that the wives and minor children of petitioners Diokno and Aquino be
allowed to visit them, subject to such precautions as respondents may deem
necessary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have taken pains to recite all the circumstances surrounding
the progress of these cases from their inception in order to correct the
impression, conveyed by the pleadings of petitioner Diokno, that their
disposition has been unnecessarily, if not deliberately, delayed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot yield to anyone in being
concerned that individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the fundamental
law of the land are duly protected and safeguarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fully cognizant of how important not
only to the petitioners but also to the maintenance of the rule of law is the
issue of legality of the continued constraints on the freedoms of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under ordinary circumstances, it does not
really take the Court much time to determine whether a deprivation of personal
liberty is legal or illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, aside
from the unusual procedural setbacks related above, it just happens that the
basic issues to resolve here do not affect only the individual rights of
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the importance of
these cases transcends the interest of those who, like petitioners, have come
to the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, what is directly
involved here is the issue of the legality of the existing government
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, We have to act with
utmost care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, in a sense, the
legality of the Court's own existence is also involved here, and We do not want
anyone to even suspect We have hurried precipitately to uphold Ourselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to these considerations, it must be borne in mind
that there are thousands of other cases in the Court needing its continued
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With its clogged docket, the
Court, could ill afford to give petitioners any preference that would entail
corresponding injustice to other litigants before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, under the New Constitution, the administrative
jurisdiction over all lower courts, including the Court of Appeals, has been
transferred from the Department of Justice to the Supreme Court, and because
that Department refrained from attending to any administrative function over
the courts since January 17, 1973, on April 18, 1973, after the Ratification
Cases became final, We found in Our hands a vast accumulation of administrative
matters which had to be acted upon without further delay, if the smooth and
orderly functioning of the courts had to be maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, of course, the Court has to continuously
attend to its new administrative work from day to day, what with all kinds of complaints
and charges being filed daily against judges, clerks of courts and other
officers and employees of the different courts all over the country, which the
Court <i>en banc</i> has to tackle It should not be surprising at all that a
great portion of our sessions <i>en banc</i> has to be devoted to the consideration
and disposition of such administrative matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, in this same connection account must also be taken
of the fact that the transfer of the administrative functions of the Department
to the Court naturally entailed problems and difficulties which consumed Our
time, if only because some of the personnel had to acquaint themselves with the
new functions entrusted to them, while corresponding adjustments had to be made
in the duties and functions of the personnel affected by the transfer.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">PRELIMINARY ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, before proceeding to the discussion and resolution of the
issues in the pending petitions, two preliminary matters call for disposition,
namely, first, the motion of petitioner Jose W. Diokno, thru counsel Senator
Tañada, to be allowed to withdraw his basic petition and second, the objection
of petitioner, Francisco "Soc" Rodrigo, to the Court's considering
his petition as moot and academic as a consequence of his having been released
from his place of confinement in Fort Bonifacio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Related to the latter is the express
manifestation of the other petitioners:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Joaquin P. Roces, Teodoro M. Locsin, Sr., Rolando Fadul, Rosalind
Galang, Go Eng Guan, Maximo V. Soliven, Renato Constantino, Luis R. Mauricio,
Napoleon G. Rama, Jose Mari Velez, Ramon. V. Mitra, Jr., Juan L. Mercardo,
Roberto Ordoñez, Manuel Almario and Ernesto Rondon, to the effect that they
remain as petitioners, notwithstanding their having been released (under the
same conditions as those imposed on petitioner Rodrigo), thereby implying that
they are not withdrawing, as, in fact, they have not withdrawn their petitions
and would wish them resolved on their merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Manifestation of counsel for petitioners dated March 15, 1974.)</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent petitioner Diokno's motion to withdraw, only seven members
of the Court, namely, Chief Justice Makalintal, and Justices Zaldivar,
Fernando, Teehankee, Muñoz Palma, Aquino and the writer of this opinion, voted
to grant the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said number being
short of the eight votes required for binding action of the Court <i>en banc</i>
even in an incident, pursuant to Section 11 of Rule 56, the said motion is
denied, without prejudice to the right of each member of the Court to render
his individual opinion in regard to said motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the reasons vigorously advanced by petitioner Diokno in
his motion to withdraw is that he cannot submit his case to the Supreme Court
as it is presently constituted, because it is different from the one in which
he filed his petition, and that, furthermore, he is invoking, not the present
or New Constitution of the Philippines the incumbent justices have now sworn to
protect and defend but the Constitution of 1935<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
under which they were serving before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, in the "Manifestation of Compliance and Submission"
filed by his counsel as early as December 1, 1973, a similar feeling was
already indicated, as may be gathered from the portions thereof quoted earlier
in this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Had petitioner reiterated and insisted on the position asserted
by him in said manifestation shortly after the ratification of the New
Constitution on January 17, 1973 or even later, after the decision of this
Court in the Ratification Cases became final on April 17, 1973, perhaps, there
could have been some kind of justification for Our then and there declaring his
petition moot and academic, considering his personal attitude of refusing to
recognize the passing out of the 1935 Constitution and of the Supreme Court
under it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the fact is that as late
as June 29, 1973, more than six months after the ratification of the New
Constitution and more than two months after this Court had declared that
"there is no more judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being
considered as in force and effect", petitioner Diokno, thru counsel
Tañada, filed a "Supplemental Petition and Motion for Immediate
Release" wherein nary a word may be found suggesting the point that both
the Constitution he is invoking and the Court he has submitted his petition to
have already passed into inexistence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, he insisted in this last motion that "an order be issued (by
this Court) directing respondents to immediately file charges against him if
they have evidence supporting the same." Be it noted, in this connection,
that by resolution of the Court of June 1, 1973, it had already implemented the
provisions on the Judiciary of the New Constitution and had constituted itself
with nine members into the first Division, thereby making it unmistakably clear
that it was already operating as the Supreme Court under the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact now capitalized by petitioner that
the Justices took the oath only on October 29, 1973 is of no significance, the
truth being that neither the Justices continuation in office after the New
Constitution took effect nor the validity or propriety of the Court’s
resolution of June 1, 1973 just mentioned were questioned by him before.
Accordingly, the allegation in his motion to withdraw relative to the New
Constitution and the present Supreme Court appear to be obvious afterthoughts
intended only to lend color to his refusal to have the issue of alleged
illegality of his detention duly resolved, realizing perchance the untenability
thereof and the inevitability of the denial of his petition, albeit none of
this will ever be admitted, as may be gathered from his manifestation that he
would not want to have anything to do with any ruling of the Court adverse to
his pretensions. Just the same, the new oaths of the Justices and the
applicability hereto of the Old and the New Constitution will be discussed in
another part of this opinion, if only to satisfy the curiosity of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the other petitioners have not joined the subject
withdrawal motion, it might just as well be stated, for whatever relevant
purpose it may serve, that with particular reference to petitioner Rodrigo, as
late as November 27, 1973, after three new justices were added to the
membership of the Court in partial obedience to the mandate of the New
Constitution increasing its total membership to fifteen, and after the Court
had, by resolution of November 15, 1973, already constituted itself into two
divisions of six Justices each, said petitioner filed a Manifestation "for
the purpose of showing that, insofar as (he) herein petitioner is concerned,
his petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> is not moot and academic." Notably,
this manifestation deals specifically with the matter of his "conditional
release" as being still a ground for <i>habeas corpus</i> but does not
even suggest the fundamental change of circumstances relied upon in petitioner
Diokno's motion to withdraw. On the contrary, said manifestation indicates
unconditional submission of said petitioner to the jurisdiction of this Court
as presently constituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of similar
tenor is the manifestation of counsel for the remaining petitioners in these
cases dated <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it appears quite clearly that
petitioners should be deemed as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court as it is presently constituted in order that it may resolve their
petitions for <i>habeas corpus</i> even in the light of the provisions of the
New Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the submission of these petitioners that their release
under the foregoing conditions is not absolute, hence their present cases
before the Court have not become moot and academic and should not be dismissed
without consideration of the merits thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They claim that in truth they have nut been freed, because actually,
what has been done to them is only to enlarge or expand the area of their
confinement in order to include the whole Greater Manila area instead of being
limited by the boundaries of the army camps wherein they were previously
detained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They say that although they
are allowed to go elsewhere, they can do so only if expressly and specifically
permitted by the army authorities, and this is nothing new, since they could
also go out of the camps before with proper passes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that they never accepted the
above conditions voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, it is their position that they are in actual fact being still so
detained and restrained of their liberty against their will as to entitle them
in law to the remedy of <i>habeas corpus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in this particular submittal regarding the reach of
<i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We readily agree
that the fundamental law of the land does not countenance the diminution or
restriction of their individual freedoms of any person in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one in
this country may suffer, against his will, any kind or degree of constraint
upon his right to go to any place not prohibited by law, without being entitled
to this great writ of liberty, for it has not been designed only against
illegal and involuntary detention in jails, prisons and concentration camps,
but for all forms and degrees of restraint, without authority of law or the
consent of the person concerned, upon his freedom to move freely, irrespective
of whether the area within which he is small or large, as long as it is not
co-extensive with that which may be freely reached by anybody else, given the
desire and the means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than half a
century ago in 1919, this Court already drew the broad and all-encompassing
scope of <i>habeas corpus</i> in these unequivocal words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A prime specification of an application
for a writ of <i>habeas corpus </i>is restraint of liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essential object and purpose of the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i> is to inquire into all manners of involuntary restraint
as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such
restraint is illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any restraint
which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6a</span></span></a> There is no reason at all at this
time, hopefully there will never be any in the future, to detract a whit from
this noble attitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, the
conditions under which petitioners have been released fall short of restoring
to them the freedom to which they are constitutionally entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a showing that the imposition of said
conditions is authorized by law can stand in the way of an order that they be
immediately and completely withdrawn by the proper authorities so that the
petitioners may again be free men as we are.</p>

<p class="BODY">And so, We mime to the basic question in these cases:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are petitioners being detained or otherwise
restrained of liberty, evidently against their will, without authority of law
and due process?</p>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, on the basis of carefully evaluated and verified
information, it is definitely established that lawless elements who are moved
by a common or similar ideological conviction, design, strategy and goal and
enjoying the active moral and material support of a foreign power and being
guided and directed by intensely devoted, well trained, determined and ruthless
groups of men and seeking refuge under the protection of our constitutional
liberties to promote and attain their ends, have entered into a conspiracy and
have in fact joined and banded their resources and forces together for the
prime purpose of, and in fact they have been and are actually staging,
undertaking and waging an armed insurrection and rebellion against the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines in order to forcibly seize
political and state power in this country, overthrow the duly constituted
Government, and supplant our existing political, social, economic and legal
order with an entirely new one whose form of government, whose system of laws,
whose conception of God and religion, whose notion of individual rights and family
relations, and whose political, social, economic, legal and moral precepts are
based on the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, these lawless elements, acting in concert through
seemingly innocent and harmless, although actually destructive, front
organizations which have been infiltrated or deliberately formed by them, have
continuously and systematically strengthened and broadened their memberships
through sustained and careful recruiting and enlistment of new adherents from among
our peasantry, laborers, professionals, intellectuals, students, and mass media
personnel, and through such sustained and careful recruitment and enlistment
have succeeded in spreading and expanding their control and influence over
almost every segment and level of our society throughout the land in their
ceaseless effort to erode and weaken the political, social, economic, legal and
moral foundations of our existing Government, and to influence, manipulate and
move peasant, labor, student and terroristic organizations under their
influence or control to commit, as in fact they have committed and still are
committing, acts of violence, depredations, sabotage and injuries against our
duly constituted authorities, against the members of our law enforcement agencies,
and worst of all, against the peaceful members of our society;</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, in the fanatical pursuit of their conspiracy and
widespread acts of violence, depredations, sabotage and injuries against our
people, and in order to provide the essential instrument to direct and carry
out their criminal design and unlawful activities, and to achieve their
ultimate sinister objectives, these lawless elements have in fact organized,
established and are now maintaining a Central Committee, composed of young and
dedicated radical students and intellectuals, which is charged with guiding and
directing the armed struggle and propaganda assaults against our duly
constituted Government, and this Central Committee is now imposing its will and
asserting its sham authority on certain segments of our population, especially
in the rural areas, through varied means of subterfuge, deceit, coercion,
threats, intimidations, machinations, treachery, violence and other modes of
terror, and has been and is illegally exacting financial and other forms of
tributes from our people to raise funds and material resources to support its
insurrectionary and propaganda activities against our duly constituted
Government and against our peace-loving people;</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, in order to carry out, as in fact they have carried out,
their premeditated plan to stage, undertake and wage a full scale armed
insurrection and rebellion in this country, these lawless elements have
organized, established and are now maintaining a well trained, well armed and highly
indoctrinated and greatly expanded insurrectionary force, popularly known as
the 'New People's Army,' which has since vigorously pursued and still is
vigorously pursuing a relentless and ruthless armed struggle against our duly
constituted Government and whose unmitigated forays, raids, ambuscades,
assaults and reign of terror and acts of lawlessness in the rural areas and in
our urban centers brought about the treacherous and cold-blooded assassination
of innocent civilians, military personnel of the Government and local public
officials in many parts of the country, notably in the Cagayan Valley, in
Central Luzon, in the Southern Tagalog Region, in the Bicol Area, in the
Visayas and in Mindanao, and whose daring and wanton guerrilla activities have generated
and sown fear and panic among our people, have created a climate of chaos and
disorder, produced a state of political, social, psychological, and economic
instability in our land, and have inflicted great suffering and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>irreparable injury to persons and property in
our society;</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREAS, these lawless elements, their cadres, fellow-travellers,
friends, sympathizers and supporters have for many years up to the present time
been mounting sustained, massive and destructive propaganda assaults against our
duly constituted Government its instrumentalities, agencies and officials, and
also against our social, political, economic and religious institutions,
through the publications, broadcasts and disseminations of deliberately slanted
and overly exaggerated news stories and news commentaries as well as false,
vile, foul and scurrilous statements, utterances, writings and pictures through
the press-radio-television media and through leaflets, college campus
newspapers and some newspapers published and still being published by these
lawless elements, notably the 'Ang Bayan,' 'Pulang Bandila' and the 'Ang
Komunista,' all of which are clearly well-conceived, intended and calculated to
malign and discredit our duly constituted Government, its instrumentalities, agencies
and officials before our people, making it appear to the people that our
government has become so weak and so impotent to perform and discharge its
functions and responsibilities in our society and to our people, and thus
undermine and destroy the faith and loyalty and allegiance of our people in and
alienate<span style="">&nbsp; </span>their support for their duly
constituted Government, its instrumentalities, agencies and officials, and
thereby gradually erode and weaken as in fact they had so eroded and weakened
the will of our people to sustain and defend our Government and our democratic
way of life;</blockquote>

duly constituted Government and against our people, and having committed and
are still committing acts of armed insurrection and rebellion consisting of
armed raids, forays, sorties, ambushes, wanton acts of murders, spoilage,
plunder, looting, arsons, destruction of public and private buildings, and
attacks against innocent and defenseless civilian lives and property, all of
which activities have seriously endangered and continue to endanger public
order and safety and the security of the nation, and acting with cunning and
manifest precision and deliberation and without regard to the health, safety

L-34265, and L-34339, as a consequence of the suspension of the privilege of
the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> by me as President of the Philippines in my
Proclamation No. 889, dated August 21, 1971, as amended, has found that in
truth and in fact there exists an actual insurrection and rebellion in the
country by a sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow
the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is what the Supreme
Court said in its decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1971</st1:date>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'. . . our jurisprudence attests abundantly to the Communist
activities in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
especially in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, from the late
twenties to the early thirties, then aimed principally at incitement to
sedition or rebellion, as the immediate objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the establishment of the Commonwealth of
the Philippines, the movement seemed to have waned notably; but, the outbreak
of World War II in the Pacific and the miseries, the devastation and havoc, and
the proliferation of unlicensed firearms concomitant with the military
occupation of the Philippines and its subsequent liberation, brought about, in
the late forties, a resurgence of the Communist threat, with such vigor as to
be able to organize and operate in Central Luzon an army — called HUKBALAHAP,
during the occupation, and renamed Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB) after
liberation — which clashed several times with the Armed Forces of the
Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted then President
Quirino to issue Proclamation No. 210, dated <st1:date year="1950" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1950</st1:date>, suspending the privilege of the writ of
<i>habeas corpus</i> the validity of which was upheld in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>

were apprehended in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently accused and convicted of the
crime of rebellion, they served their respective sentences.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The fifties saw a comparative lull in Communist activities,
insofar as peace and order were concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still, on June 20, 1957, Republic Act No. 1700, otherwise known as the
Anti-Subversion Act, was approved, upon the grounds stated in the very preamble
of said statute — that</p>

<p class="3Q">'. . . the Communist Party of the Philippines, although purportedly
a political party, is in fact an organized conspiracy to overthrow the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines, not only by force and violence
but also by deceit, subversion and other illegal means, for the purpose of
establishing in the Philippines a totalitarian regime subject to alien
domination and control;</p>

<p class="3Q">‘. . . the continued existence and activities of the Communist
Party of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
constitutes a clear, present and grave danger to the security of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
and</p>

<p class="3Q">'. . . in the face of the organized, systematic and persistent
subversion, national in scope but international in direction, posed by the
Communist Party of the Philippines and its activities, there is urgent need for
special legislation to cope with this continuing menace to the freedom and
security of the country. . .'</p>

<p class="2Q">"In the language of the Report on <st1:place>Central Luzon</st1:place>,
submitted, on <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1971</st1:date>,
by the Senate Ad Hoc Committee of Seven — copy of which Report was filed in
these case by the petitioners herein —</p>

<p class="3Q">'The years following 1963 saw the successive emergence in the
country of several mass organizations, notably the Lapiang Manggagawa (now the
Socialist Party of the Philippines) among the workers, the Malayang Samahan ng
mga Magsasaka (MASAKA) among the peasantry; the Kabataang Makabayan (KM) among
the youth/students; and the Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN)
among the intellectuals/professionals, the PKP has exerted all-out effort to
infiltrate, influence and utilize these organizations in promoting its radical
brand of nationalism.'</p>

<p class="2Q">"Meanwhile, the Communist leaders in the Philippines had been
split into two (2) groups, one of which — composed mainly of young radicals,
constituting the Maoist faction — reorganized the Communist Party of the
Philippines early in 1969 and established a New People's Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This faction adheres to the Maoist concept of
the 'Protracted People's War' or 'War of National Liberation.' Its 'Programme
for a People's Democratic Revolution' states, <i>inter</i> <i>alia:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="3Q">'The Communist Party of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is determined to implement its general programme for a people's democratic
revolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All Filipino communists are
ready to sacrifice their lives for the worthy cause of achieving the new type
of democracy, of building a new <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
that is genuinely and completely independent, democratic, united, just and
prosperous . . .</p>

<p class="3Q">'The central task of any revolutionary movement is to seize
political power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Communist Party of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
assumes this task at a time that both the international and national situation
are favorable, to taking the road of armed revolution . . .'</p>

<p class="2Q">'In the year 1969, the NPA had — according to the records of the
Department of National Defense — conducted raids, resorted to kidnappings and
taken part in other violent incidents numbering over 230, in which it inflicted
404 casualties, and, in turn, suffered 243 losses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1970, its record of violent incidents was
about the same, but the NPA casualties more than doubled.</p>

<p class="2Q">'At any rate, two (2) facts are undeniable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) all Communists, whether they belong to
the traditional group or to the Maoist faction, believe that force and violence
are indispensable to the attainment of their main and ultimate objective, and
act in accordance with such belief, although they disagree on the means to be
used at a given time and in a particular place; and (b) there is a New People's
Army, other, of course, than the Armed Forces of the Republic and antagonistic
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such New People's Army is per
se proof of the existence of a rebellion especially considering that its
establishment was announced publicly by the reorganized CPP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such announcement is in the nature of a
public challenge to the duly constituted authorities and may be likened to a
declaration of war, sufficient to establish a war status or a condition of
belligerency, even before the actual commencement of hostilities.</p>

<p class="2Q">'We entertain, therefore, no doubts about the existence of a
sizeable group of men who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the
Government and have thus been and still are engage in rebellion against the
Government of the Philippines.'</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, these lawless elements have to a considerable extent
succeeded in impeding our duly constituted authorities from performing their functions
and discharging their duties and responsibilities in accordance with our laws
and our Constitution to the great damage, prejudice and detriment of the people
and the nation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it is evident that there is throughout the land a
state of anarchy and lawlessness, chaos and disorder, turmoil and destruction
of a magnitude equivalent to an actual war between the forces of our duly
constituted Government and the New People's Army and their satellite
organizations because of the unmitigated forays, raids, ambuscades, assaults,
violence, murders, assassinations, acts of terror, deceits, coercions, threats,
intimidations, treachery, machinations, arsons, plunders and depredations
committed and being committed by the aforesaid lawless elements who have

<p class="2Q">'. . . the Executive had information and reports — subsequently
confirmed, in many respects, by the above-mentioned Report of the Senate Ad Hoc
Committee of Seven — to the effect that the Communist Party of the Philippines
does not merely adhere to Lenin's idea of a swift armed uprising; that it has,
also, adopted Ho Chi Minh's terrorist tactics and resorted to the assassination
of uncooperative local officials; that, in line with this policy, the
insurgents have killed 5 mayors, 20 barrio captains and 3 chiefs of police;
that there were fourteen (14) meaningful bombing incidents in the Greater
Manila Area in 1970; that the Constitutional Convention Hall was bombed on June
12, 1971, that, soon after the Plaza Miranda incident, the NAWASA main pipe at
the Quezon City-San Juan boundary, was bombed; that this was followed closely
by the bombing of the Manila City Hall, the COMELEC Building, the Congress
Building and the MERALCO sub-station at Cubao, Quezon City; and that the
respective residences of Senator Jose J. Roy and Congressman Eduardo Cojuangco
were, likewise, bombed, as were the MERALCO main office premises, along Ortigas
Avenue, and the Doctor's Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Building, in Caloocan City.</p>

<p class="2Q">'. . . the reorganized Communist Party of the Philippines has,
moreover, adopted Mao's concept of protracted people's war, aimed at the
paralyzation of the will to resist of the Government, of the political,
economic and intellectual leadership, and of the people themselves; that
conformably to such concept, the Party has placed special emphasis upon a most
extensive and intensive program of subversion by the establishment of front
organizations in urban centers, the organization of armed city partisans and
the infiltration in student groups, labor unions, and farmer and professional
groups; that the CPP has managed to infiltrate or establish and control nine
(9) major labor organizations; that it has exploited the youth movement and
succeeded in making Communist fronts of eleven (11) major student or youth
organizations; that there are, accordingly, about thirty (30) mass
organizations actively advancing the CPP interests, among which are the
Malayang Samahan ng Magsasaka (MASAKA), the Kabataang Makabayan (KM), the
Movement for the Advancement of Nationalism (MAN), the Samahang Demokratiko ng
Kabataan (SDK), the Samahang Molave (SM), and the Malayang Pagkakaisa ng
Kabataang Pilipino (MPKP); that, as of August, 1971, the KM had two hundred
forty-five (245) operational chapters throughout the Philippines of which
seventy-three were in the Greater Manila Area, sixty (60) in Northern Luzon,
forty-nine (49) in Central Luzon, forty-two (42) in the Visayas and twenty-one
(21) in Mindanao and Sulu; that in 1970, the Party had recorded two hundred
fifty-eight (258) major demonstrations, of which about thirty-three (33) ended
in violence, resulting in fifteen (15) killed and over five hundred (500)
injured; that most of these actions were organized, coordinated or led by the
aforementioned front organizations; that the violent demonstrations were
generally instigated by a small, but well-trained group of armed agitators;
that the number of demonstrations heretofore staged in 1971 has already
exceeded those of 1970; and that twenty-four (24) of these demonstrations were
violent, and resulted in the death of fifteen (15) persons and the injury of
many more.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Subsequent events . . . have also proven . . . the threat to
public safety posed by the New People's Army.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it appears that, since August 21, 1971, it had in Northern Luzon
six (6) encounters and staged one (1) raid, in consequence of which seven (7)
soldiers lost their lives and two (2) others were wounded, whereas the
insurgents suffered five (5) casualties; that on August 26, 1971, a well-armed
group of NPA, trained by defector Lt. Victor Corpus, attacked the very command
post of TF LAWIN in Isabela, destroying two (2) helicopters and one (1) plane,
and wounding one (1) soldier; that the NPA had in Central Luzon a total of four
(4) encounters, with two (2) killed and three (3) wounded on the side of the
Government, one (1) BSDU killed and three (3) KM-SDK leader, an unidentified
dissident, and Commander Panchito leader of the dissident group were killed;
that on August 26, 1971, there was an encounter in the barrio of San Pedro,
Iriga City, Camarines Sur, between the PC and the NPA, in which a PC and two
(2) KM members were killed; that the current disturbances in Cotabato and the
Lanao provinces have been rendered more complex by the involvement of the
CPP/NPA, for, in mid-1971, a KM group, headed by Jovencio Esparagoza, contacted
the Higaonan tribes, in their settlement in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental, and
offered them books, pamphlets and brochures of Mao Tse Tung, as well as
conducted teach-ins in the reservation; that Esparagoza was reportedly killed
on September 22, 1971, in an operation of the PC in said reservation; and that
there are now two (2) NPA cadres in Mindanao.</p>

<p class="2Q">'It should, also be noted that adherents of the CPP and its front
organizations are, according to intelligence findings, definitely capable of
preparing powerful explosives out of locally available materials; that the bomb
used in the Constitutional Convention Hall was a 'Claymore' mine, a powerful
explosive device used by the U.S. Army, believed to have been one of many
pilfered from the Subic Naval Base a few days before; that the President had
received intelligence information to the effect that there was a July-August
Plan involving a wave of assassinations, kidnappings, terrorism and mass
destruction of property and that an extraordinary occurrence would signal the
beginning of said event; that the rather serious condition of peace and order
in Mindanao, particularly in Cotabato and Lanao, demanded the presence therein
of forces sufficient to cope with the situation; that a sizeable part of our
armed forces discharges other functions, and that the expansion of the CPP
activities from Central Luzon to other parts of the country, particularly
Manila and its suburbs, the Cagayan Valley, Ifugao, Zambales, Laguna, Quezon
and the Bicol Region, required that the rest of our armed forced be spread thin
over a wide area.'</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">The particular case of</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify;">petitioner
Aquino</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards petitioner Aquino, it appears from his allegations in
his petition and supplemental petition for prohibition in G. R. No. L-37364,
already referred to earlier, (1) that on August 11, 1973, six criminal charges,
for illegal possession of firearms, etc., murder and violation of RA 1700 or
the Anti-Subersion Act, were filed against him with Military Commission No. 2, created
under General Order Nos. 8, 12 and 39, (2) that on August 28, 1973, the
President created, thru Administrative Order No. 355, a special committee to
undertake the preliminary investigation or reinvestigation of said charges, and
(3) that he questions the legality of his prosecution in a military commission
instead of in a regular civilian court as well as the creation of the special
committee, not only because of alleged invalidity of Proclamation 1081 and
General Order No. 2 and the orders authorizing the creation of military
commissions but also because Administrative Order No. 355 constitutes allegedly
a denial of the equal protection of the laws to him and to the others affected
thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the procedural standpoint, these developments did not warrant
the filing of a separate petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
supplemental petition in G. R. No. L-35546, wherein he is one of the
petitioners, would have sufficed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
inasmuch as petitioner Aquino has chosen to file an independent special civil
action for prohibition in said G.R. No. L-37364 without withdrawing his
petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> in G. R. No. L-35546, We wish to make it
clear that in this decision, the Court is going to resolve, for purposes of the
<i>habeas corpus</i> petition of said petitioner, only the issues he has raised
that are common with those of the rest of the petitioners in all these cases,
thereby leaving for resolution in G.R. No. L-37364 all the issues that are
peculiar only to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
insofar as petitioner Aquino is concerned, the Court will resolve in this
decision the question of legality of his detention by virtue of Proclamation
1081 and General Order No. 2, such that in G. R. No. L-37364, what will be
resolved will be only the constitutional issues related to the filing of charges
against him with Military Commission No. 2, premised already on whatever will
be the Court's resolution in the instant cases regarding Proclamation 1081 and
General Order No. 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the other petitioners, none of them stands
charged with any offense before any court or military commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they all contend that they have not
committed any act for which they can be held criminally liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going back to the facts, it may be mentioned, at this juncture,
that on the day Proclamation 1081 was signed, the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was actually holding a special session scheduled to end on <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been in uninterrupted session since
its regular opening in January, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its regular session was adjourned on May 18, 1972, followed by three
special sessions of thirty days each,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> from May 19 to June 22, June 23 to
July 27 and July 28 to August 31, and one special session of twenty days, from
September 1 to September 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter
of fact, petitioner Aquino was in a conference of a joint committee of the
Senate and the House of Representatives when he was arrested in one of the
rooms of the Hilton Hotel in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must also be stilted at this point that on November 30, 1972,
the Constitutional Convention of 1971, which convened on June 1, 1971 and had
been in continuous session since then, approved a New Constitution; that on
January 17, 1973, Proclamation 1102 was issued proclaiming the ratification
thereof; and that in the Ratification Cases aforementioned, the Supreme Court
rendered on March 31, 1973, a judgment holding that "there is no further
judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being considered in force and
effect." Among the pertinent provisions of the New Constitution is Section

<p class="OTHERHEADING">THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY">First of all, petitioners challenge the factual premises and
constitutional sufficiency of Proclamation 1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Invoking the Constitution of 1935 under which
it was issued, they vigorously maintain that "while there may be rebellion
in some remote places, as in Isabela, there is no basis for the nationwide
imposition of martial law, since:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) no
large scale rebellion or insurrection exists in the Philippines; (b) public
safety does not require it, inasmuch as no department of the civil government —
is shown to have been unable to open or function because of or due to, the
activities of the lawless elements described in the Proclamation; (c) the
Executive has given the nation to understand — and there exists no evidence to
the contrary — that the armed forces can handle the situation without
'utilizing the extraordinary powers of the President etc;' and (d) problem in
the Greater Manila Area . . . where petitioners were seized and arrested was, a
the time martial law was proclaimed, plain lawlessness and criminality."
(pp. 69-70, Petitioners' Memorandum).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
his supplemental petition, petitioner Diokno individually posits that
especially these days, with the improved conditions of peace and order, there
is no more constitutional justification for the continuance of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioners
question not only the constitutional sufficiency both in fact and in law of the
proclamation but also the legality of their detention and constraints,
independently of any finding of validity of the proclamation, while in his
supplemental petition petitioner Diokno individually submits that the Court
should declare that it has already become illegal to continue the present
martial law regime because the emergency for which it was proclaimed, if it
ever existed, has already ceased,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as
attested by various public and official declarations of no less than the
President himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
respondents would want the Court to lay its hands off the instant petitions,
claiming that under General Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A, aforequoted, the President
has ordered that the Judiciary shall not try and decide cases "involving
the validity, legality or constitutionality" of Proclamation 1081 and any
order, decree or acts issued or done pursuant to said Proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend most vehemently that this Court
has no jurisdiction to inquire into the factual bases of the proclamation, any
question as to the propriety or constitutional sufficiency of its issuance
being, according to them, political and nonjusticiable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point out, in this connection, that in
the above-mentioned referendum of January 10-15, 1973 and more so in that of
July 27-28, 1973; the sovereign people impressed their seal of approval on the
continuation of martial law for as long as the President may deem it wise to
maintain the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on the assumption
the Court can make an inquiry into the factual bases of the Proclamation, they
claim there was more than sufficient justification for its issuance, in the
light of the criterion of arbitrariness sanctioned by Us in Lansang <i>vs</i>.
Garcia, 42 SCRA 448.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents further
maintain that it is only by another official proclamation by the President, not
by a judicial declaration, that martial law may be lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, in their answer of July 26,
1973 to petitioner Diokno's supplemental petition, respondents contend that the
express provisions of the above-quoted transitory provision of the New
Constitution, have made indubitable that Proclamation 1081 as well as all the
impugned General Orders are constitutional and valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the fundamental questions presented for the Court's
resolution are:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

related to the propriety or constitutional sufficiency of the issuance of the

people and the political departments of the government to determine?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And viewed from existing jurisprudence in the
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
is not the doctrine laid down by this Court in Lansang <i>vs</i>. Garcia,
supra, applicable to these cases?</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Even assuming Lansang to be applicable,
and on the basis of the criterion of arbitrariness sanctioned therein, can it

proclamation was constitutionally issued, may not the Supreme Court declare
upon the facts of record and those judicially known to it now that the
necessity for martial law originally found by the President to exist has
already ceased so us to make further continuance of the present martial law
regime unconstitutional?</span></p>

placing of the country under martial law is constitutional until the President
himself declares otherwise, is there any legal justification for the arrest and
detention as well as the other constraints upon the individual liberties of the
petitioners, and, in the affirmative, does such justification continue up to
the present, almost two years from the time of their apprehension, there being
no criminal charges of any kind against them nor any warrants of arrest for
their apprehension duly issued pursuant to the procedure prescribed by law?</span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Finally, can there still be any
doubt regarding the constitutionality of the issuance of Proclamation 1081 and
all the other proclamations and orders, decrees, instructions and acts of the
President issued or done by him pursuant to said Proclamation, considering that
by the terms of Section 3 (2) of Article XVII of the Constitution of the
Philippines of 1973, "all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions and
acts promulgated, issued or done by the incumbent President shall be part of
the law of the land, and shall remain valid, legal, binding and effective"
until revoked or superseded by the incumbent President himself or by the
regular National Assembly established under the same Constitution?</span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top: 15pt;">THE ISSUE OF JURISDICTION</p>

<p class="BODY">By its very nature, the issue of jurisdiction vigorously urged by
the Solicitor General calls for prior resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, whenever the authority of the Court to
act is seriously challenged, it should not proceed any further until that
authority is clearly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it
goes without saying that such authority may be found only in the existing laws
and/or the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">For a moment, however, there was a feeling among some members of
the Court that the import of the transitory provisions of the New Constitution
referred to in the fifth question above has made the issue of jurisdiction
posed by the respondents of secondary importance, if not entirely academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until, upon further reflection, a consensus
emerged that for Us to declare that the transitory provision invoked has
rendered moot and academic any controversy as to the legality of the impugned
acts of the President is to assume that the issue is justiciable, thereby by
passing the very issue of jurisdiction We are asked to resolve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel that while perhaps, such reliance on
the transitory provision referred to may legally suffice to dispose of the
cases at bar, it cannot answer persistent queries regarding the powers of the
Supreme Court in a martial law situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would still leave unsettled a host of controversies related to the
continued exercise of extraordinary powers by the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, such assumption of justiciability
would leave the Court open to successive petitions asking that martial law be
lifted, without Our having resolved first the correctness of such
assumption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, nothing short of a
categorical and definite ruling of this Court is imperative regarding the
pretended non-justiciability of the issues herein, if the people are to know,
as they must, whether the present governmental order has legitimate
constitutional foundations or it is supported by nothing more than naked force
and self-created stilts to keep it above the murky waters of
unconstitutionality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is but
proper that We tackle first the questions about the authority of the Court to
entertain and decide these cases before discussing the materiality and effects
of the transitory provision relied upon by respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, it is not alone the matter of jurisdiction
that We should decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beyond the purely
legal issues placed before Us by the parties, more fundamental problems are
involved in these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
all-important matters which a historical decision like this cannot ignore on
the pretext that Our duty in the premises is exclusively judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether all the members of the Court like it
or not, the Court has to play its indispensable and decisive role in resolving
the problems confronting our people in the critical circumstances in which they
find themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, we cannot
dissociate ourselves from them, for we are Filipinos who must share the common
fate to which the denouement of the current situation will consign our
nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The priority issue before Us is
whether We will subject the assailed acts of the President to judicial scrutiny
as to its factual bases or We will defer to his findings predicated on evidence
which are in the very nature of things officially available only to him, but in
either case, our people must know that Our decision has democratic foundations
and conforms with the great principles for which our nation exists.</p>

<p class="BODY">The New Constitution itself is in a large sense a product of the
political convulsion now shaking precariously the unity of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, that those presently in
authority had a hand in one way or another in its formulation, approval and
ratification can hardly be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
justify, therefore, the restraint upon the liberties of petitioners through an
exclusive reliance on the mandates of the new charter, albeit logically and
technically tenable, may not suffice to keep our people united in the faith
that there is genuine democracy in the existing order and that the rule of law
still prevails in our land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow the
disturbing thought may keep lingering with some, if not with many, of our
countrymen that by predicating Our decision on the basis alone of what the New
Constitution ordains, We are in effect allowing those presently in authority
the dubious privilege of legalizing their acts and exculpating themselves from
their supposed constitutional transgressions through a device which might yet
have been of their own furtive making.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, We should not be as naive as to ignore that in troublous
times like the present, simplistic solutions, however solidly based, of
constitutional controversies likely to have grave political consequences would
not sound cogent enough unless they ring in complete harmony with the tune set
by the founders of our nation when they solemnly consecrated it to the ideology
they considered best conducive to the contentment and prosperity of all our
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the commitment of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the ideals of democracy and freedom is ever evident and indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is writ in the martyrdom of our
revolutionary forbears when they violently overthrew the yoke of Spanish
despotism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an indelible part of
the history of our passionate and zealous observance of democratic principles
and practices during the more than four decades that <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is reaffirmed in bright
crimson in the blood and the lives of the countless Filipinos who fought and
died in order that our country may not be subjugated under the militarism and
totalitarianism of the Japanese then, who were even enticing us with the idea
of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And today, that our people are showing considerable disposition to
suffer the imposition of martial law can only be explained by their belief that
it is the last recourse to save themselves from the inroads of ideologies
antithetic to those they cherish and uphold.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, the eyes of all the peoples of the world on both sides of
the bamboo and iron curtains are focused and what has been happening in our
country since <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial law in any country has such awesome
implications that any nation under it is naturally an interesting study subject
for the rest of mankind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who
consider themselves to be our ideological allies must be keeping apprehensive
watch on how steadfastly we shall remain living and cherishing our common
fundamental political tenets and ways of life, whereas those of the opposite
ideology must be eagerly anticipating how soon we will join them in the
conviction that, after all, real progress and development cannot be achieved
without giving up individual freedom and liberty and unless there is
concentration of power in the exercise of government authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true the Philippines continues to enjoy
recognition of all the states with whom it had diplomatic relations before
martial law was proclaimed, but it is not difficult to imagine that as soon as
it has become definite or anyway apparent to those concerned that the
Philippines has ceased to adhere to the immutable concepts of freedom and
democracy enshrined in its own fundamental law, corresponding reactions would
manifest themselves in the treatment that will be given us by these states.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our chosen form of government, the Supreme Court is the
department that most authoritatively speaks the language of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, how the present
martial law and the constraints upon the liberties of petitioners can be
justified under our Constitution which provides for a republican democratic
government will be read by the whole world in the considerations of this
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From them they will know
whither we are going as a nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
importantly, by the same token, history and the future generations of Filipinos
will render their own judgment on all of us who by the will of Divine
Providence have to play our respective roles in this epochal chapter of our
national life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this decision,
everyone concerned will determine how truly or otherwise, the Philippines of
today is keeping faith with the fundamental precepts of democracy and liberty
to which the nation has been irrevocably committed by our heroes and martyrs
since its birth.</p>

<p class="BODY">And we should not gloss over the fact that petitioners have come
to this Court for the protection of their rights under the provisions of the
Old Charter that have remained unaltered by the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not be fair to them, if the
provisions invoked by them still mean what they had always meant before, to
determine the fate of their petitions on the basis merely of a transitory
provision whose consistency with democratic principles they vigorously
challenge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this delicate period of our national life, when faith in each
other and unity among all of the component elements of our people are indispensable,
We cannot treat the attitude and feelings of the petitioners, especially
Senator Diokno<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> who is still
under detention without formal charges, with apathy and indifferent
unconcern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their pleadings evince quite
distinctly an apprehensive, nay a fast dwindling faith in the capacity of this
Court to render them justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bluntly
put, their pose is that the justice they seek may be found only in the correct
construction of the 1935 Constitution, and they make no secret of their fears
that because the incumbent members of the Court have taken an oath to defend
and protect the New Constitution, their hopes of due protection under the Bill
of Rights of the Old Charter may fall on deaf ears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Diokno, in particular, with the
undisguised concurrence of his chief counsel, former Senator Tañada
despairingly bewails that although they are "convinced beyond any nagging
doubt that (they are) on the side of right and reason and law and justice,
(they are) equally convinced that (they) cannot reasonably expect either right
or reason, law or justice, to prevail in (these) case(s)."</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, We do not feel bound to soothe the subjective
despondency nor to cool down the infuriated feelings of litigants and lawyers
by means other than the sheer objectiveness and demonstrated technical accuracy
of our decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the peculiar
milieu of these cases, however, it is perhaps best that We do not spare any
effort to make everyone see that in discharging the grave responsibility
incumbent upon Us in the best light that God has given Us to see it, We have
explored every angle the parties have indicated and that We have exhausted all
jurisprudential resources within our command before arriving at our conclusions
and rendering our verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a way, it
could indeed be part of the nobility that should never be lost in any court of
justice that no party before it is left sulking with the thought that he lost
because not all his important arguments in which he sincerely believes have
been duly considered or weighed in the balance.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, of course, petitioners' emotional misgivings are manifestly
baseless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is too evident for anyone
to ignore that the provisions of the Old Constitution petitioners are invoking
remain unaltered in the New Constitution and that when it comes to the basic
precepts underlying the main portions of both fundamental laws, there is no
disparity, much less any antagonism between them, for in truth, they are the
same identical tenets to which our country, our government and our people have always
been ineradicably committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar,
therefore, as said provisions and their underlying principles are concerned,
the new oath taken by the members of the Court must be understood, not in the
disturbing sense petitioners take them, but rather as a continuing guarantee of
the Justices' unswerving fealty and steadfast adherence to the self-same tenets
and ideals of democracy and liberty embodied in the oaths of loyalty they took
with reference to the 1935 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to what is obviously the erroneous impression of
petitioner Diokno, the fundamental reason that impelled the members of the
Court to take the new oaths that are causing him unwarranted agony was
precisely to regain their independence from the Executive, inasmuch as the
transitory provisions of the 1973 Constitution had, as a matter of course,
subjected the judiciary to the usual rules attendant in the reorganization of
governments under a new charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Sections 9 and 10 of Article XVII, "incumbent members of the Judiciary may
continue in office until they reach the age of seventy years, unless sooner
replaced" by the President, but "all officials whose appointments are
by this Constitution vested in the (President) shall vacate their offices upon
the appointment and qualification of their successors." In other words,
under said provisions, the Justices ceased to be permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that is precisely why our new oaths
containing the phrase "na pinagpapatuloy sa panunungkulan", which
petitioner Diokno uncharitably ridicules ignoring its real import, was prepared
by the Secretary of Justice in consultation with the Court, and not by the
President or any other subordinate in the Executive office, purposely to make
sure that the oath taking ceremony which was to be presided by the President
himself would connote and signify that thereby, in fact and in contemplation of
law, the President has already exercised the power conferred upon him by the
aforequoted transitory constitutional provisions to replace anyone of us with a
successor at anytime.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no Presidential edict at all for the Justices to take
such an oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President informed the
Court that he was determined to restore the permanence of the respective
tenures of its members, but there was a feeling that to extend new appointments
to them as successors to themselves would sound somehow absurd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, in a conference among the President,
the Secretary of Justice and all the Justices, a mutually acceptable
construction of the pertinent transitory provision was adopted to the effect
that an official public announcement was to be made that the incumbent Justices
would be continued in their respective offices without any new appointment, but
they would take a fittingly worded oath the text of which was to be prepared in
consultation between the Secretary of Justice and the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by that oath taking, all the members of
the Court, other than the Chief Justice and the three new Associate Justices,
who because of their new appointments are not affected by the transitory
provisions, are now equally permanent with them in their constitutional
tenures, as officially and publicly announced by the President himself on that
occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the
reorganization of the Supreme Court contemplated in the transitory provisions
referred to, which, incidentally was also a feature of the transitory
provisions of the 1935 Constitution, albeit, limited then expressly to one
year, (Section 4, Article XVI) has already been accomplished, and all the
Justices are now unreachably beyond the presidential prerogative either
explicit or implicit in the terms of the new transitory provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, in these faith and spirit and with this
understanding, supported with prayers for guidance of Divine Providence, that
We have deliberated and voted on the issues in these cases — certainly, without
any claim of monopoly of wisdom and patriotism and of loyalty to all that is
sacred to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Filipino people.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the Governments insistent posture that the
Supreme Court should abstain from inquiring into the constitutional sufficiency
of Proclamation 1081 is predicated on two fundamental grounds, namely, (1) that
under General Order No. 3, as amended by General Order No. 3-A, "the
Judiciary (which includes the Supreme Court) shall continue to function in
accordance with its present organization and personnel, and shall try and
decide in accordance with existing laws all criminal and civil cases, except
the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1. Those involving the
validity, legality or constitutionality of Proclamation 1081 dated September
21, 1972 or of any decree, order or acts issued, promulgated or performed by
(the President) or by (his) duly designated representative pursuant
thereto," and (2) the questions involved in these cases are political and
non-justiciable and, therefore, outside the domain of judicial inquiry.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">A</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">GENERAL ORDERS NOS. 3 AND 3-A
HAVE CEASED TO BE OPERATIVE INSOFAR AS THEY ENJOIN THE JUDICIARY OF
JURISDICTION OVER CASES INVOLVING THE VALIDITY OF THE PROCLAMATIONS, ORDERS OR
ACTS OF THE PRESIDENT.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first ground thus invoked by the respondents, it is not
without importance to note that the Solicitor General relies barely on the
provisions of the general orders cited without elaborating as to how the
Supreme Court can be bound thereby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the totality of the judicial power is vested in the
Court by no less than the Constitution, both the Old and the New, the absence
of any independent showing of how the President may by his own fiat
constitutionally declare or order otherwise is certainly significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that the Solicitor General
considered it more prudent to tone down any possible frontal clash with the
Court, but as We see it, the simplistic tenor of the Solicitor General's
defense must be due to the fact too well known to require any evidential proof
that by the President's own acts, publicized here and abroad, he had made it
plainly understood that General Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A are no longer operative
insofar as they were intended to divest the Judiciary of jurisdiction to pass
on the validity, legality or constitutionality of his acts under the aegis of
martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, according to the
President, it was upon his instructions given as early as <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1972</st1:date>, soon after the filing of the
present petitions, that the Solicitor General submitted his return and answer
to the writs We have issued herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is a matter of public knowledge that the President's repeated avowal of the
Government's submission to the Court is being proudly acclaimed as the
distinctive characteristic of the so-called "martial law — Philippine
style", since such attitude endows it with the democratic flavor so
dismally absent in the martial law prevailing in other countries of the world.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, even if it were to be assumed at this juncture that
by virtue of the transitory provision of the New Constitution making all orders
of the incumbent President part of the law of the land, General Orders Nos. 3
and 3-A are valid, the position of the respondents on the present issue of
jurisdiction based on said orders has been rendered untenable by the very acts
of the President, which in the words of the same transitory provision have
"modified, revoked or superseded" them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in this connection, it is important to
note that the transitory provision just referred to textually says that the
acts of the incumbent President shall "remain valid, legal, binding and
effective . . . unless modified, revoked or superseded by subsequent proclamations,
orders, decrees, instructions or other acts of the incumbent President, or
unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National
Assembly", thereby implying that the modificatory or revocatory acts of
the President need not be as express and explicit as in the case of the
National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, when
it comes to acts of the President, mere demonstrated inconsistency of his
posterior acts with earlier ones would be enough for implied modification or
revocation to be effective, even if no statement is made by him to such effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rationalizing his attitude in regard to the Supreme Court during
martial law, President Marcos has the following to say in his book entitled
"Notes on the New Society of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>":</p>

<blockquote>"Our martial law is unique in that it is based on the
supremacy of the civilian authority over the military and on complete
submission to the decision of the Supreme Court, and most important of all, the
people. . . ." (p. 103)</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, upon the approval by the Constitutional Convention of a
new Constitution, I organized the barangays or village councils or citizens
assemblies in the barrios (a barrio is the smallest political unit in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I directed the new Constitution to be
submitted to the barangays or citizens assemblies in a formal plebiscite from <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10 to 15, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barangays voted almost unanimously to
ratify the Constitution, continue with martial law and with the reforms of the
New Society.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This action was questioned in a petition filed before our Supreme
Court in the cases entitled Javellana <i>vs</i>. Executive Secretary et al,
G.R. No. L-36143, 36164, 36165, 36236 and 36283.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue raised was whether I had the power
to call a plebiscite; whether I could proclaim the ratification of the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In raising this issue, the
petitioners (who, incidentally, were Liberals or political opposition leaders)
raised the fundamental issue of the power of the President under a proclamation
of martial law to issue decrees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Inasmuch as the issues in turn raised the question of the
legitimacy of the entire Government and also to meet the insistent suggestion
that, in the event of an adverse decision, I proclaim a revolutionary
government, I decided to submit to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as I
had done in the Lansang <i>vs</i>. Garcia case (already quoted) in 1971 when
almost the same parties in interest questioned my powers as President to
suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Refer to pp. 13-17.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>This would, at the same time, calm the fears of every cynic who had
any misgivings about my intentions and claimed that I was ready to set up a
dictatorship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For who is the dictator
who would submit himself to a higher body like the Supreme Court on the question
of the constitutionality or validity of his actions?" (pp. 103-104.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It will be noted that I had submitted myself to the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in all cases questioning my authority in 1971
in the case of Lansang <i>vs</i>. Garcia on the question of the suspension of
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, and in the case just cited
on the proclamation of martial law as well as the other related cases."
(pp. 105-106.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Nothing could be more indicative, than
these words of the President himself, of his resolute intent to render General
Orders Nos. 3 and 3-A inoperative insofar as the Supreme Court's jurisdiction
over cases involving the validity, legality or constitutionality of his acts
are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, the tenor and
purpose of the said general orders are standard in martial law proclamations,
and the President's attitude is more of an exception to the general
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, with this
development, petitioners have no reason to charge that there is a
"disrobing" of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even as the President unequivocally reaffirms, over and above
martial law, his respect for the Supreme Court's constitutionally assigned role
as the guardian of the Constitution and as the final authority as to its
correct interpretation and construction, it is entirely up to the Court to
determine and define its own constitutional prerogatives <i>vis-a-vis</i> the
Proclamation and the existing martial law situation, given the reasons for the
declaration and its avowed objectives.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">B</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">MAY THE SUPREME COURT INQUIRE
INTO THE FACTUAL BASES OF THE ISSUANCE OF PROCLAMATION 1081 TO DETERMINE ITS
CONSTITUTIONAL SUFFICIENCY?</p>

<p class="BODY">The second ground vigorously urged by the Solicitor General is
more fundamental, since, prescinding from the force of the general orders just
discussed, it strikes at the very core of the judicial power vested in the
Court by the people thru the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is claimed that insofar as the instant petitions impugn the issuance
of Proclamation 1081 as having been issued by the President in excess of his
constitutional authority, they raise a political question not subject to
inquiry by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with
reference to the plea of the petitioners that their arrest, detention and other
restraints, without any charges or warrants duly issued by the proper judge,
constitute clear violations of their rights guaranteed by the fundamental law,
the stand of the respondents is that the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> has been suspended automatically in consequence of the imposition of
martial law, the propriety of which is left by the Constitution to the
exclusive discretion of the President, such that for the proper exercise of
that discretion he is accountable only to the sovereign people, either directly
at the polls or thru their representatives by impeachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Never before has the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
been confronted with a problem of such transcendental consequences and
implications as the present one entails.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is here an exertion of extreme state power involving the
proclaimed assumption of the totality of government authority by the Executive,
predicated on his own declaration that a state of rebellion assuming "the
magnitude of an actual state of war against our people and the Republic of the
Philippines" exists (22nd whereas of Proclamation 1081) and that "the
public order and safety and the security of this nation demand that immediate,
swift, decisive and effective action be taken to protect and insure the peace,
order and security of the country and its population and to maintain the
authority of the government." (19th whereas, id.) Upon the other hand,
petitioners deny the factual bases of the Proclamation and insist that it is
incumbent upon the Court, in the name of democracy, liberty and the Constitution,
to inquire into the veracity thereof and to declare, upon finding them to be
untrue, that the Proclamation is unconstitutional and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents counter, however, that the very
nature of the Proclamation demands that the Court should refrain from making
any such inquiry, considering that, as already stated, the discretion as to
whether or not martial law should be imposed is lodged by the Constitution in
the President exclusively.</p>

<p class="BODY">As We enter upon the extremely delicate task of resolving the
grave issues thus thrust upon Us, We are immediately encountered by absolute
verities to guide Us all the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first and most important of them is that the Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> is
the supreme law of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means
among other things that all the powers of the government and of all its
officials from the President down to the lowest emanate from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of them may exercise any power unless it
can be traced thereto either textually or by natural and logical implication.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second is that is settled that the Judiciary provisions of
the Constitution point to the Supreme Court<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>as
the ultimate arbiter of all conflicts as to what the Constitution or any part
thereof means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the other
Departments may adopt their own construction thereof, when such construction is
challenged by the proper party in an appropriate case wherein a decision would
be impossible without determining the correct construction, the Supreme Court's
word on the matter controls.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third is that in the same way that the Supreme Court is the
designated guardian of the Constitution, the President is the specifically
assigned protector of the safety, tranquility and territorial integrity of the
nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This responsibility of the
President is his alone and may not be shared by any other Department.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth is that, to the end just stated, the Constitution
expressly provides that "in case of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or
imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he (the Executive)
— "may (as a last resort) . . . place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law".<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fifth is that in the same manner that the Executive power
conferred upon the Executive by the Constitution is complete, total and
unlimited, so also, the judicial power vested in the Supreme Court and the
inferior courts, is the very whole of that power, without any limitation or
qualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sixth is that although the Bill of Rights in the Constitution
strictly ordains that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property without due process of law",<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> even this basic guarantee of
protection readily reveals that the Constitution's concern for individual
rights and liberties is not entirely above that for the national interests,
since the deprivation it enjoins is only that which is without due process of
law, and laws are always enacted in the national interest or to promote and
safeguard the general welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, it is understood that the law thus passed, whether procedural or substantive,
must afford the party concerned the basic elements of justice, such as the
right to be heard, confrontation, and counsel, <i>inter alia</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">And the seventh is that whereas the Bill of Rights of the 1935
Constitution explicity enjoins that "(T)he privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion, when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same
may be suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension
shall exist",<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> there is no similar injunction
whether expressed or implied against the declaration of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">From these incontrovertible postulates, it results, first of all,
that the main question before Us is not in reality one of jurisdiction, for
there can be no conceivable controversy, especially one involving a conflict as
to the correct construction of the Constitution, that is not contemplated to be
within the judicial authority of the courts to hear and decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judicial power of the courts being
unlimited and unqualified, it extends over all situations that call for the
ascertainment and protection of the rights of any party allegedly violated,
even when the alleged violator is the highest official of the land or the
government itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore,
evident that the Court's jurisdiction to take cognizance of and to decide the
instant petitions on their merits is beyond challenge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, however, it must be borne in mind that in the
form of government envisaged by the framers of the Constitution and adopted by
our people, the Court's indisputable and plenary authority to decide does not
necessarily impose upon it the duty to interpose its fiat as the only means of
settling the conflicting claims of the parties before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is ingrained in the distribution of powers
in the fundamental law that hand in hand with the vesting of the judicial power
upon the Court, the Constitution has coevally conferred upon it the discretion
to determine, in consideration of the constitutional prerogatives granted to
the other Departments, when to refrain from imposing judicial solutions and
instead defer to the judgment of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is in the very nature of republican governments that certain matters
are left in the residual power of the people themselves to resolve, either
directly at the polls or thru their elected representatives in the political
Departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And these
reserved matters are easily distinguishable by their very nature, when one
studiously considers the basic functions and responsibilities entrusted by the
charter to each of the great Departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To cite an obvious example, the protection,
defense and preservation of the state against internal or external aggression
threatening its very existence is far from being within the ambit of judicial
responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distinct role then
of the Supreme Court of being the final arbiter in the determination of
constitutional controversies does not have to be asserted in such contemplated
situations, thereby to give way to the ultimate prerogative of the people
articulated thru suffrage or thru the acts of their political representatives
they have elected for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, these fundamental considerations are the ones that lie at
the base of what is known in American constitutional law as the political
question doctrine, which in that jurisdiction is unquestionably deemed to be
part and parcel of the rule of law, exactly like its apparently more attractive
or popular opposite, judicial activism, which is the fullest exertion of
judicial power, upon the theory that unless the courts intervene injustice
might prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been invoked and
applied by this Court in varied forms and modes of projection in several
momentous instances in the past;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> and it is the main support of the
stand of the Solicitor General on the issue of jurisdiction in the cases at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also referred to as the
doctrine of judicial self-restraint or abstention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the nomenclatures themselves imply,
activism and self-restraint are both subjective attitudes, not inherent
imperatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice of alternatives
in any particular eventuality is naturally dictated by what in the Court's
considered opinion is what the Constitution envisions should be done in order
to accomplish the objectives of government and of nationhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And perhaps it may be added here to avoid
confusion of concepts, that We are not losing sight of the traditional approach
based on the doctrine of separation of powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In truth, We perceive that even under such mode of rationalization, the
existence of power is secondary, respect for the acts of a co-ordinate,
co-equal and co-independent Department being the general rule, particularly
when the issue is not encroachment of delimited areas of functions but alleged
abuse of a Department's own basic prerogatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the final analysis, therefore, We need not indulge in any
further discussion as to whether or not the Court has jurisdiction over the
merits of the instant petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
definite that it has.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the real
question before Us is whether or not the Court should act on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, do We have here that
appropriate occasion for activism on the part of the Court, or, do the
imperatives of the situation demand, in the light of the reservations in the fundamental
law just discussed, that We defer to the political decision of the
Executive?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After mature deliberation,
and taking all relevant circumstances into account, We are convinced that the
Court should abstain in regard to what is in all probability the most important
issue raised in them, namely, whether or not the Court should inquire into the
constitutional sufficiency of Proclamation 1081 by receiving evidence tending
to belie the factual premises thereof. It is Our considered view that under the
Constitution, the discretion to determine ultimately whether or not the
Philippines or any part thereof should be placed under martial law and for how
long is lodged exclusively in the Executive, and for this reason, it is best
that We defer to his judgment as regards the existence of the grounds therefor,
since, after all, it is not expected that the Supreme Court should share with
him the delicate constitutional responsibility of defending the safety,
security, tranquility and territorial integrity of the nation in the face of a
rebellion or invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
abdication of judicial power, much less a violation of Our oaths "to
support and defend the Constitution"; rather, this is deference to an act
of the Executive which, in Our well-considered view, the Constitution
contemplates the Court should refrain from reviewing or interfering with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To Our mind, the following considerations, <i>inter
alia</i>, impel no other conclusion:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">1</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been said that martial law has no generally accepted
definition, much less a precise meaning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as We see it, no matter how variously it has been described, a
common element is plainly recognizable in whatever has been said about it — it
does not involve executive power alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To be more exact, martial law is state power which involves the totality
of government authority, irrespective of the Department or official by whom it
is administered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because, as
admitted by all, martial law is every government's substitute for the established
governmental machinery rendered inoperative by the emergency that brings it
forth, in order to maintain whatever legal and social order is possible during
the period of emergency, while the government is engaged in battle with the
enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, with the breakdown of
the regular government authority or the inability of the usual offices and
officials to perform their functions without endangering the safety of all
concerned, anarchy and chaos are bound to prevail and protection of life and
property would be nil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse,
the confusion and disorder would detract the defense efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indispensable therefore that some kind
of government must go on, and martial law appears to be the logical
alternative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, from the point of
view of safeguarding the people against possible governmental abuses, it is not
the declaration of martial law and who actually administers it that is of
supreme importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone has of
necessity to be in command as surrogate of the whole embattled government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is what is actually done by the administrator
affecting individual rights and liberties that must pass constitutional
standards, even as these are correspondingly adjusted to suit the necessities
of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is not to say
that redress of constitutional offenses would immediately and necessarily be
available, for even the procedure for securing redress, its form and time must
depend on what such necessities will permit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Viewed in depth, this is all that can be visualized as contemplated in
the supposedly fundamental principle invoked by petitioners to the effect that
necessity and necessity alone is the justification and the measure of the
powers that may be exercised under martial law.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">2</p>

<p class="BODY">In countries where there is no constitutional provision
sanctioning the imposition of martial law, the power to declare or proclaim the
same is nevertheless conceded to be the most vital inherent prerogative of the
state because it is axiomatic that the right of the state to defend itself
against disintegration or subjugation by another cannot be less than an
individual's natural right of self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The resulting repression or restraint of individual rights is therefore
justified as the natural contribution that the individual owes to the state, so
that the government under which he lives may survive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, such subordination to the general
interest is supposed to be temporary, coincident only with the requirements of
the emergency.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, under the general practice in those countries,
it is considered as nothing but logical that the declaration or proclamation
should be made by the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it
is that none of the cases cited by petitioners, including those of Hearon <i>vs</i>.
Calus, 183, S.E. 24 and Allen <i>vs</i>. Oklahoma City, 52 Pac. Rep. 2nd
Series, pp. 1054-1059, may be deemed as a binding precedent sustaining
definitely that it is in the power of the courts to declare an Executive's
proclamation or declaration of martial law in case of rebellion or insurrection
to be unconstitutional and unauthorized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our own research has not yielded any jurisprudence upholding the
contention of petitioners on this point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is clear and incontrovertible from all the cases cited by both
parties is that the power of the Executive to proclaim martial law in case of
rebellion has never been challenged, not to say outlawed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has always been assumed, even if the
extent of the authority that may be exercised under it has been subjected to
the applicable provision of the constitution, with some courts holding that the
enforceability of the fundamental law within the area of the martial law regime
is unqualified, and the others maintaining that such enforceability must be
commensurate with the demands of the emergency situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there is actually no
authoritative jurisprudential rule for Us to follow in respect to the specific
question of whether or not the Executive's determination of the necessity to
impose martial law during a rebellion is reviewable by the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If We have to go via the precedential route,
the most that We can find is that the legality of an Executive's exercise of
the power to proclaim martial law has never been passed upon by any court in a
categorical manner so as to leave no room for doubt or speculation.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">3<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not have to resort to assumptions
regarding any inherent power of the government to proclaim a state of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is an implied inherent
prerogative of the government in other countries is explicitly conferred by our
people to the government in unequivocal terms in the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly in this connection, it is to
the Executive that the authority is specifically granted "in cases of
invasion, insurrection or rebellion, when public safety requires it", to
"place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under Martial Law".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To be sure, petitioners admit that much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But they insist on trying to show that the factual premises of the
Proclamation are not entirely true and are, in any event, constitutionally
insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They urge the Court to
pass on the merits of this particular proposition of fact and of law in their
petitions and to order thereafter the nullification and setting aside thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe the Court should interfere.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent constitutional provision is explicit and unequivocal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President shall be commander-in-chief of
all armed forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it, he may suspend the privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law." (Section 10(2), Article VII, 1935
Constitution.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Prime
Minister shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of any part thereof under martial law." (Section 12, Article IX, 1973
Constitution.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Except for the reference to the Prime Minister in the New
Constitution instead of to the President as in the Old, the wording of the
provision has remained unaltered <i>ipssissimis verbis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Accordingly, the two Constitutions cannot
vary in meaning; they should be construed and applied in the light of exactly
the same considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this sense
at least, petitioners' invocation of the 1935 Constitution has not been
rendered academic by the enforcement of the new charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purposes of these cases, We will in
the main consider their arguments as if there has been no Javellana decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, since in those countries where martial law is an
extra-constitutional concept, the Executive's proclamation thereof, as observed
above, has never been considered as offensive to the fundamental law, whether
written or unwritten, and, in fact, not even challenged, what reason can there
be that here in the Philippines, wherein the Constitution directly and definitely
commits the power to the Executive, another rule should obtain?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are we Filipinos so incapable of electing an
Executive we can trust not to unceremoniously cast aside his constitutionally
worded oath solemnly and emphatically imposing upon him the duty "to
defend and protect the Constitution"?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or is the Court to be persuaded by possible partisan prejudice or the
subjective rationalization informing personal ambitions?</p>

<p class="BODY">Reserving for further discussion the effect of Lansang upon the
compelling force of the opinions in Barcelon <i>vs</i>. Baker, 5 Phil. 87 and
Montenegro <i>vs</i>. Castaneda, 91 Phil. 862, relative to the issue at hand,
We cannot lightly disregard the ponderous reasons discussed in said opinions
supporting the view that the Executive's choice of means in dealing with a
rebellion should be conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Barcelon, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Thus the question is squarely presented whether or not the
judicial department of the Government may investigate the facts upon which the
legislative and executive branches of the Government acted in providing for the
suspension and in actually suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus in said provinces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Has the
Governor-General, with the consent of the Commission, the right to suspend the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If so, did the Governor-General suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
in the Provinces of Cavite and Batangas in accordance with such authority?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A paragraph of section 5 of the act of Congress of <st1:date year="1902" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1902</st1:date>, provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not
be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the
public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be
suspended by the President, or by the Governor-General with the approval of the
Philippine Commission, whenever during such period the necessity for such
suspension shall exist.'</p>

<blockquote>This provision of the act of Congress is the only provision giving
the Governor-General and the Philippine Commission authority to suspend the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No question has been raised with reference to the authority of Congress
to confer this authority upon the President or the Governor-General of these <st1:place>Islands</st1:place>,
with the approval of the Philippine Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This provision of the act of Congress makes two conditions
necessary in order that the President or the Governor-General with the approval
of the Philippine Commission may suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus. </i>They are as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When there exists rebellion, insurrection, or
invasion; and</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When public safety may require it.</p>

<blockquote>In other words, in order that the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> may be suspended, there must exist rebellion, insurrection, or
invasion, and the public safety must require it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is admitted, but the question is,
Who shall determine whether there exists a state of rebellion, insurrection, or
invasion, and that by reason thereof the public safety requires the suspension
of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been argued and admitted that the Governor-General, with the
approval of the Philippine Commission, has discretion, when insurrection,
rebellion, or invasion actually exist, to decide whether the public safety
requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>;
but the fact whether insurrection, rebellion, or invasion does actually exist
is an open question, which the judicial department of the Government may
inquire into and that the conclusions of the legislative and executive
departments (the Philippine Commission and the Governor-General) of the
Government are not conclusive upon that question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, it is contended that the judicial department of the
Government may consider an application for the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
even though the privileges of the same have been suspended, in the manner
provided by law, for the purposes of taking proof upon the question whether
there actually exists a state of insurrection, rebellion, or invasion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The applicants here admit that if a state of rebellion,
insurrection, or invasion exists, and the public safety is in danger, then the
President, or Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission,
may suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Inasmuch as the President, or Governor-General with the approval of
the Philippine Commission, can suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> only under the conditions mentioned in the said statute, it becomes
their duty to make an investigation of the existing conditions in the
Archipelago, or any part thereof, to ascertain whether there actually exists a
state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, and that the public safety
requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this investigation is concluded, the
President, or the Governor-General with the consent of the Philippine
Commission, declares that there exist these conditions, and that the public
safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
can the judicial department of the Government investigate the same facts and
declare that no such conditions exist?</blockquote>

<blockquote>The act of Congress, above quoted, wisely provides for the
investigation by two departments of the Government — the legislative and
executive — of the existing conditions, and joint action by the two before the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> can be suspended in these <st1:place>Islands</st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the investigation and findings of the President, or the
Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, are not
conclusive and final as against the judicial department of the Government, then
every officer whose duty it is to maintain order and protect the lives and
property of the people may refuse to act, and apply to the judicial department of
the Government for another investigation and conclusion concerning the same
conditions, to the end that they may be protected against civil actions
resulting from illegal acts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Owing to conditions at times, a state of insurrection, rebellion,
or invasion may arise suddenly and may jeopardize the very existence of the
State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose, for example, that one of
the thickly populated Governments situated near this Archipelago, anxious to
extend its power and territory, should suddenly decide to invade these <st1:place>Islands</st1:place>,
and should, without warning, appear in one of the remote harbors with a
powerful fleet and at once begin to land troops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The governor or military commander of the
particular district or province notifies the Governor-General by telegraph of
this landing of troops and that the people of the district are in collusion
with such invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Might not the
Governor-General and the Commission accept this telegram as sufficient evidence
and proof of the facts communicated and at once take steps, even to the extent
of suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, as might
appear to them to be necessary to repel such invasion?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that all men interested in the
maintenance and stability of the Government would answer this question in the
affirmative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But suppose someone, who has been arrested in the district upon the
ground that his detention would assist in restoring order and in repelling the
invasion, applies for the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, alleging that no
invasion actually exists; may the judicial department of the Government call
the officers actually engaged in the field before it and away from their posts
of duty for the purpose of explaining and furnishing proof to it concerning the
existence or non-existence of the facts proclaimed to exist by the legislative
and executive branches of the State?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
so, then the courts may effectually tie the hands of the executive, whose
special duty it is to enforce the laws and maintain order, until the invaders have
actually accomplished their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
interpretation contended for here by the applicants, so pregnant with
detrimental results, could not have been intended by the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> when it enacted the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is the duty of the legislative branch of the Government to make such
laws and regulations as will effectually conserve peace and good order and
protect the lives and property of the citizens of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the Governor-General to
take such steps as he deems wise and necessary for the purpose of enforcing
such laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every delay and hindrance and
obstacle which prevents a strict enforcement of laws under the conditions
mentioned necessarily tends to jeopardize public interests and the safety of
the whole people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the judicial
department of the Government, or any officer in the Government, has a right to
contest the orders of the President or of the Governor-General under the
conditions above supposed, before complying with such orders, then the hands of
the President or the Governor-General may be tied until the very object of the
rebels or insurrectos or invaders has been accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is urged that the President, or the
Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, might be
mistaken as to the actual conditions; that the legislative department — the
Philippine Commission — might, by resolution, declare after investigation, that
a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion exists, and that the public
safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
when, as a matter of fact, no such conditions actually existed; that the
President, or Governor-General acting upon the authority of the Philippine
Commission, might by proclamation suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> without there actually existing the conditions mentioned in the act
of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
applicants allege in their argument in support of their application for the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, that the legislative and executive branches of
the Government might reach a wrong conclusion from their investigations of the
actual conditions, or might, through a desire to oppress and harass the people,
declare that a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion existed and that
public safety required the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> when actually and in fact no such conditions did exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can not assume that the legislative and
executive branches will act or take any action based upon such motives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover it can not be assumed that the legislative and executive
branches of the Government, with all the machinery which those branches have at
their command for examining into the conditions in any part of the Archipelago,
will fail to obtain all existing information concerning actual conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the executive branch of the
Government to constantly inform the legislative branch of the Government of the
condition of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> as to the prevalence of peace or
disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The executive branch of the
Government, through its numerous branches of the civil and military, ramifies
every portion of the Archipelago, and is enabled thereby to obtain information
from every quarter and corner of the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Can the judicial department of the Government, with its very limited
machinery for the purpose of investigating general conditions, be any more sure
of ascertaining the true conditions throughout the Archipelago, or in any
particular district, than the other branches of the Government?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think not." (At p. 91-96.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same general question presented here was presented to the
Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the case of Martin <i>vs</i>. Mott, in January, 1821.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An act of Congress of 1795 provided —</blockquote>

in answering this question, said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The power thus confided by Congress to the President is,
doubtless, of a very high and delicate nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A free people are naturally jealous of the exercise of military power;
and the power to call the militia into actual service is certainly felt to be
one of no ordinary magnitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is
not a power which can be executed without corresponding responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, in its terms, a limited power,
confined to cases of actual invasion, or of imminent danger of invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it be a limited power, the question
arises, By whom is the exigency to be adjudged of and decided?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the President the sole and exclusive judge
whether the exigency has arisen, or is it to be considered as an open question,
upon which every officer to whom the orders of the President are addressed, may
decide for himself, and equally open to be contested by every militiaman who
shall refuse to obey the orders of the President?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are all of the opinion that the authority
to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the President
and his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think that this construction necessarily
results from the nature of the power itself and from the manifest object
contemplated by the act of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
power itself is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, upon great occasions
of state and under circumstances which may be vital to the existence of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.
. . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a superior officer has a right
to contest the orders of the President, upon his own doubts as to the exigency
having arisen, it must be equally the right of every inferior officer and
soldier . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a course would be
subversive of all discipline and expose the best disposed officer to the
chances of erroneous litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, in many instances, the evidence upon which the President might
decide that there is imminent danger of invasion might be of a nature not
constituting strict technical proof, or the disclosure of the evidence might
reveal important secrets of state which the public interest and even safety
might imperiously demand to be kept in concealment.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Whenever the statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to
be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule
of construction that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge
of the existence of those facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
the present case we are all of opinion, that such is the true construction of
the act of 1795.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no answer that
such power may be abused, for there is no power which is not susceptible of
abuse.' (Martin <i>vs</i>. Mott, 12 Wheat., 19 (25 U.S); Vanderheyden <i>vs</i>.

<blockquote>But it may be argued by those who contend for the contrary
doctrine, to wit, that the acts of the Governor-General, with the approval of
the Philippine Commission, are not conclusive upon the courts and that none of
the foregoing citations are exactly in point, that none of these cases or
authors treat of a case exactly like the one presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are fortunate, however, in being able to
cite, in answer to that contention, the case of Henry William Boyle, where
exactly the same question was presented to the supreme court of the State of <st1:state><st1:place>Idaho</st1:place></st1:state>,
which the applicants present here and where the courts held the doctrine of the
cases applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Boyle, he
had been arrested after the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus had been
suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He applied for a writ of <i>habeas</i>
<i>corpus</i> to the supreme court of <st1:state><st1:place>Idaho</st1:place></st1:state>,
alleging, among other things, in his application:</blockquote>

<blockquote>First. That 'no insurrection, riot, or rebellion now exists in <st1:place><st1:placename>Shoshone</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>County</st1:placetype></st1:place>;' and</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second. That 'the Governor has no authority to proclaim martial law
or suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>In reply to this contention on the part of the applicant, Boyle,
the court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Counsel have argued ably and ingeniously upon the question as to
whether the authority to suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> rests with
the legislative and executive powers of the Government, but, from our views of
this case, that question cuts no figure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are of the opinion that whenever, for the purpose of putting down
insurrection or rebellion, the exigencies of the case demand it, with the
successful accomplishment of this end in view, it is entirely competent for the
executive or for the military officer in command, if there be such, either to
suspend the writ or disregard it if issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The statutes of this State (Idaho) make it the duty of the governor,
whenever such a state or condition exists as the proclamation of the governor
shows does exist in Shoshone County, to proclaim such locality in a state of
insurrection and to call in the aid of the military of the State or of the
Federal Government to suppress such insurrection and reestablish permanently
the ascendancy of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be
an absurdity to say that the action of the executive, under such circumstances,
may be negative and set at naught by the judiciary or that the action of the
executive may be interfered with or impugned by the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the courts are to be made a sanctuary, a
seat of refuge whereunto malefactors may fall for protection from punishment
justly due for the commission of crime they will soon cease to be that
palladium of the rights of the citizen so ably described by counsel.</p>

<p class="2Q">'On application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the truth of
recitals of alleged facts in a proclamation issued by the governor proclaiming
a certain county to be in a state of insurrection and rebellion will not be
inquired into or reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action of
the governor in declaring Shoshone County to be in state of insurrection and
rebellion, and his action in calling to his aid the military forces of the
United States for the purpose of restoring good order and the supremacy of the
law, has the effect to put in force, to a limited extent, martial law in said county.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action is not in violation of the
Constitution, but in harmony with it, being necessary for the preservation of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such case the Government
may, like an individual acting in self-defense, take those steps necessary to
preserve its existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If hundreds of
men can assemble themselves and destroy property and kill and injure citizens,
thus defeating the ends of government, and the Government is unable to take all
lawful and necessary steps to restore law and maintain order, the State will
then be impotent if not entirely destroyed, and anarchy placed in its stead.</p>

<p class="2Q">'It having been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the governor,
after some six or seven years of experience, that the execution of the laws in
Shoshone County through the ordinary and established means and methods was
rendered practicably impossible, it became his duty to adopt the means
prescribed by the statute for establishing in said county the supremacy of the
law and insuring the punishment of those by whose unlawful and criminal acts
such a condition of things has been brought about; and it is not the province
of the courts to interfere, delay, or place obstructions in the path of duty
prescribed by law for the executive, but rather to render him all the aid and
assistance in their power, in his efforts to bring about the consummation most
devoutly prayed for by every good, law-abiding citizen in the State.' (In re
Boyle, 45 L.R.A., 1899, 832.);.)" (At pp. 99-104.)</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">These observations are followed on pages
104 to 115 by a compilation of decided cases centrally holding that
"whenever the Constitution or a statute gives a discretionary power to any
person, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, such
person is to be considered the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of
those facts." For the sake of brevity, We shall not quote the discussion
anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are confident there can be
no dissent insofar as the general proposition stated is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, in the unanimous decision of this Court in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
these views are totally adopted in a very brief passage thus:</p>

<blockquote>"B.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his second
proposition appellant insists there is no state of invasion, insurrection,
rebellion or imminent danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'There are' he admits 'intermittent sorties and lightning attacks by
organized bands in different places'; but, he argues, 'such sorties are
occasional, localized and transitory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the proclamation speaks no more than of overt acts of insurrection
and rebellion, not of cases of invasion, insurrection or rebellion or imminent
danger thereof.' On this subject is noted that the President concluded from the
facts recited in the proclamation, and others connected therewith, that 'there
is actual danger of rebellion which may extend throughout the country.' Such
official declaration implying much more than imminent danger of rebellion amply
justifies the suspension of the writ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To the petitioner's unpracticed eye the repeated encounters between
dissident elements and military troops may seem sporadic, isolated, or
casual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the officers charged with
the Nation's security, analyzed the extent and pattern of such violent clashes
and arrived at the conclusion that they are warp and woof of a general scheme
to overthrow this government <i>vi et armis</i>, by force and arms.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And we agree with the Solicitor General that in the light of the
views of the United States Supreme Court thru Marshall, Taney and Story quoted
with approval in Barcelon <i>vs</i>. Baker (5 Phil., 87, pp. 98 and 100) the
authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen requiring suspension
belongs to the President and 'his decision is final and conclusive' upon the
courts and upon all other persons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed as Justice Johnson said in that decision, whereas the
Executive branch of the Government is enabled thru its civil and military
branches to obtain information about peace and order from every quarter and
corner of the nation, the judicial department, with its very limited machinery
can not be in better position to ascertain or evaluate the conditions
prevailing in the Archipelago." (At pp. 886-887.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There are actually many more judicial precedents and opinions of
knowledgeable and authoritative text writers, that can be copied here,
maintaining with inexorable logic why the Executive is incomparably best
equipped and prepared to cope with internal and external aggression and that,
indeed, the protection of the country against such contingencies is his sole
responsibility not supposed to be shared by the Judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the proposition appears to Us so plain
and ineluctable that to summon all of them to Our assistance could only open Us
to the suspicion that the Philippine Supreme Court has to depend on borrowed
thinking to resolve the most critical issues between individual rights, on the
one hand, and state power exerted as a matter of self-defense against rebellion
and subversion imperiling the country's own survival, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Empathically, We don't have to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank God We have enough native genius and
indigenous means and resources to cope with the most delicate problems of
statehood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let others listen to and
abide by the platitudinous and elegantly phrased dicta in Milligan, supra,
Duncan and White,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> they who are in and of the
wealthiest and mightiest power in the world, that only actual military combat
and related operations can justify martial law, but We, who are in and of a
small and weak developing nation, let us hearken and follow the home-spun
advice of our barrio folks cautioning everyone thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Kung ang bahay mo ay pawid at
kawayan, pagdilim ng ulap at lumalakas na ang hangin, magsara ka na ng bintana
at suhayan mo and iyong bahay." (When your house is made of nipa and
bamboo, and you see the clouds darkening and the winds start blowing, it is
time for you to close your windows and strengthen the support of your house.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This could explain why under the
Constitution, martial law can be declared not only in case of actual rebellion,
but even only when there is imminent danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that is why the open court rule
established in Milligan and reiterated in <st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city>
and White is not controlling in this jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, inasmuch as our people have included in the Constitution
an express commitment of the power to the President, why do We have to resort
to the pronouncements of other courts of other countries wherein said power is
only implied?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of what other
courts believe their Executive may do in emergencies, our task is not to
slavishly adopt what those courts have said, for there is no evidence that such
was the intent of our constitutional fathers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, We should determine for Ourselves what is best for our own
circumstances in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
even if We have to give due consideration to the experience other peoples have
gone through under more or less similar crises in the past.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, regardless of their weight insofar as the
suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is concerned,
We consider the reasons given in the above-quoted opinions in Barcelon and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of particular relevance when it comes to the imposition of martial law.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">- 4 -</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be that the existence or non-existence or imminence of a
rebellion of the magnitude that would justify the imposition of martial law is
an objective fact capable of judicial notice, for a rebellion that is not of
general knowledge to the public cannot conceivably be dangerous to public
safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But precisely because it is
capable of judicial notice, no inquiry is needed to determine the propriety of
the Executive's action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, while the existence of a rebellion may be widely known,
its real extent and the dangers it may actually pose to the public safety are
not always easily perceptible to the unpracticed eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present day practices of rebellion,
its inseparable subversion aspect has proven to be more effective and important
than "the rising (of persons) publicly and taking arms against the
Government" by which the Revised Penal Code characterizes rebellion as a
crime under its sanction (Art. 134, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subversion is such a covert kind of
anti-government activity that it is very difficult even for army intelligence
to determine its exact area of influence and effect, not to mention the details
of its forces and resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
subversion, the rebels can extend their field of action unnoticed even up to
the highest levels of the government, where no one can always be certain of the
political complexion of the man next to him, and this does not exclude the
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arms, ammunitions and all kinds
of war equipment travel and are transferred in deep secrecy to strategic
locations, which can be one's neighborhood without him having any idea of what
is going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are so many insidious
ways in which subversives act, in fact too many to enumerate, but the point
that immediately suggests itself is that they are mostly incapable of being
proven in court, so how are We to make a judicial inquiry about them that can
satisfy our judicial conscience?</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution definitely commits it to the Executive to determine
the factual bases and to forthwith act as promptly as possible to meet the
emergencies of rebellion and invasion which may be crucial to the life of the
nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must do this with unwavering
conviction, or any hesitancy or indecision on his part will surely detract from
the needed precision in his choice of the means he would employ to repel the
aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apprehension that his
decision might be held by the Supreme Court to be a transgression of the fundamental
law he has sworn to "defend and preserve" would deter him from acting
when precisely it is most urgent and critical that he should act, since the
enemy is about to strike the mortal blow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Different men can honestly and reasonably vary in assessing the
evidentiary value of the same circumstance, and the prospect of being
considered as a constitutional felon rather than a saviour of the country
should the Justices disagree with him, would put the Executive in an unenviable
predicament, certainly unwise and imprudent for any Constitution to contemplate
he should be in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what is worse is
that the Court is not equipped in any way with the means to adequately
appreciate the insidious practices of subversion, not to say that it cannot do
it with more or at least equal accuracy as the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Court would then be acting
already with considerable hindsight considerations which can imperceptibly
influence its judgment in overriding the Executive's finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than ever before, when rebellion was purely a surface
action, and viewing the matter from all angles, it appears ineludible that the
Court should refrain from interfering with the Executive's delicate
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the sacred rights
of individuals enshrined in the Bill of Rights and the other constitutional
processes ever valuable to the people, but which admittedly cannot, by the way,
be more important than the very survival of the nation, are not necessarily
swept away by a state of martial law, for, as already pointed out earlier, the
validity of the Proclamation is one thing, the administration of the government
under it is something else that has to be done with the closest adherence to
the fundamental law that the obvious necessities of the situation will
permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We see it, it is in this
sense that the Constitution is the supreme law equally in times of peace and of
war and for all classes of men, if We must refer again to petitioners' reliance
on Milligan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, let us
not overlook, in connection with this favorite authority of petitioners, that
the Federal Supreme Court's postulation therein, that it was "happily
proved by the result of the great effort to throw off (the) just
authority" of the United States during the Civil War that the constitution
of that country contains within itself all that is necessary for its
preservation, is not factually accurate, for all the world knows that if the
American Union survived the ordeal of possible disintegration and is the great
nation that she is today, it was not because President Lincoln confined himself
strictly to the powers vested in the presidency by the constitution, but
because he was wise enough to resort to inherent extra constitutional state
prerogatives, exercisable by the Executive alone, which President Marcos did
not have to do, considering that our Constitution expressly confers upon him
the authority to utilize such state power in defense of the nation.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">— 5 —</p>

<p class="BODY">The historical development of the powers of the Philippine
Executive unmistakably points to the same direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Practically all the constitutions that came
into being during the revolutionary period before the turn of the last century,
of which the Malolos Constitution is typical, either entrusted executive power
to a commission or made the Executive largely dependent on the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Americans ended their military
occupation, after subduing the Aguinaldo forces of independence, they had their
own version of governmental powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the Philippine Bill of 1902, nothing was mentioned about martial law, and the
power of the Governor General to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> was conditioned on, among other things, the concurrence of the
Philippine Commission of which, notably, the Governor General was the
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When in 1905, the Governor General
suspended the Privilege in the provinces of <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>
and Batangas, the case of Barcelon <i>vs</i>. Baker, supra, arose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the dissent of Justice Willard who
invoked Milligan, the Supreme Court held that the proclamation ordering such
suspension was not reviewable by the Judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">With a little touch of irony, in 1916, when the United States
Congress, with the avowed intent of granting greater political autonomy to the
Philippines, enacted the Jones Law, it removed the need for legislative
concurrence in regards to the suspension of the Privilege, because the
legislature was to be in Filipino hands, and in addition to preserving such
power of suspension, granted the Governor-General the sole authority to declare
martial law, subject only to revocation by the President of the United
States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without forgetting that at that
time, the Governor-General being then an American, those powers served as
weapons of the colonizer to consolidate its hold on the subject people, such
plenitude of power in the Executive was to appear later to the Filipino leaders
as something that should be adopted in our fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was that in the Constitutional
Convention of 1934, the first the Philippines ever held in peace time, the
delegates, drawing heavily from the experience of the country during the
autonomous period of the Jones Law, and perchance persuaded in no small measure
by the personality of President Manuel L. Quezon, lost no time in adopting the
concept of a strong executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their decision
was studied and deliberate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it
is the unanimous observation of all students of our Constitution, that under
it, we have in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the strongest executive in the world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fully aware of this feature and appearing rather elated by the apparent
success of the delegates to reconcile the possible evils of dictatorship with
the need of an executive who "will not only know how to govern, but will
actually govern", President Claro M. Recto of the Convention remarked in
his valedictory address adjourning the Assembly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"During the debate on the Executive Power it was the almost
unanimous opinion that we had invested the Executive with rather extraordinary
prerogatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is much truth in
this assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is because we
cannot be insensible to the events that are transpiring around us, events
which, when all is said and done, are nothing but history repeating
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, we have seen how
dictatorships, whether black or red, capitalistic or proletarian, fascistic or
communistic, ancient or modern, have served as the last refuge of peoples when
their parliaments fail and they are already powerless to save themselves from
misgovernment and chaos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Learning our
lesson from the truth of history, and determined to spare our people the evils
of dictatorship and anarchy, we have thought it prudent to establish an
executive power which, subject to the fiscalization of the Assembly, and of
public opinion, will not only know how to govern, but will actually govern,
with a firm and steady hand, unembarrassed by vexations, interferences by other
departments, or by unholy alliances with this and that social group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, possessed with the necessary gifts of
honesty and competence, this Executive will be able to give his people an orderly
and progressive government, without need of usurping or abdicating powers, and
cunning subterfuges will not avail to extenuate his failures before the bar of
public opinion." ("The Philippine Constitution — Sources, Making,
Meaning, and Application" published by the Philippine Lawyers' Association,
p. 540.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of particular relevance to the present discussion is the fact
that when an attempt was made by a few delegates led by Delegate Salvador
Araneta of Manila to subject the Executive's power to suspend the privilege of
the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to concurrence or review by the National
Assembly and the Supreme Court, the effort did not prosper, thereby strongly
indicating, if it did not make it indubitably definite, that the intent of the
framers of the fundamental law is that the Executive should be the sole judge
of the circumstances warranting the exercise of the power thus granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the only evidence of any
thinking within the convention advocating the revocation of the Barcelon
doctrine of which together with Milligan, they were or ought to have been
aware, what with the best known lawyers in the Philippines in their midst,
collapsed with the rejection of the Araneta proposal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was in the light of this historical development of the
Executive Power that in 1951, the Supreme Court decided unanimously the case of
Montenegro <i>vs</i>. Castañeda, supra, reiterating the doctrine of
conclusiveness of the Executive's findings in the Barcelon case.</p>

<p class="BODY">For all that it may be worthy of mention here, if only because
practically the same Filipino minds, led by President Jose P. Laurel, were
largely responsible for its formulation, the Constitution of the Second
Philippine Republic born under aegis of the Japanese occupation of the
Philippines during the Second World War, provided also for a strong executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, President Laurel himself had
the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>"The fundamental reason and necessity for the creation of a
political center of gravity under the Republic is that, in any form of
government — and this is especially true in an emergency, in a national crisis
— there must be a man responsible for the security of the state, there must be
a man with adequate powers, to face any given situation and meet the problems
of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be no shifting
of responsibility; there must be no evasion of responsibility; and if a
government is to be a real government and a scientific government there must be
no two centers of gravity but one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2
O.G. [J.M.A.], 873 [1943].)" (The Philippine Presidency by Irene R.
Cortes, p. 14.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing is a logical follow-up of what <st1:city><st1:place>Laurel</st1:place></st1:city>
had said in the 1934 Convention thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x A strong executive he is intended to be, because a
strong executive we shall need, especially in the early years of our
independent, or semi-independent existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A weak executive is synonymous with a weak government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall not be a 'monarch' or a dictator in
time of profound and Octavian peace, <i>but he virtually so becomes in an
extraordinary emergency</i>; and whatever may be his position, he bulwarks,
normally, the fortifications of a strong constitutional government, but
abnormally, in extreme cases, he is suddenly ushered in as a Minerva,
full-grown and in full panoply of war, <i>to occupy the vantage ground as the
ready protector and defender of the life and honor of his nation." </i>(Italics
supplied.) (The Philippine Constitution, published by the Phil. Lawyers
Association, Vol. I, 1969 Ed., p. 183.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it is not surprising at all that without changing one word
in the provision granting to the Executive the power to cope with the
emergencies under discussion, the 1971 Convention fortified thru related
provisions in the transitory portion of the Constitution the applicability of
the Barcelon and Montenegro concepts of the Executive's power, as applied to
the imposition of martial law, thereby weakening <i>pro</i> <i>tanto as </i>will
be seen in the following pages, the impact of Our Lansang doctrine, for the
purposes of the precise issue now before Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it may be pointed out that the power granted to
the Executive to place the country or any part thereof under martial law is
independent of the legislative grant to him of emergency powers authorized
under the following provision of the 1935 Constitution:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In times of
war or other national emergency, the Congress may by law authorize the
President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may
prescribe, to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out a declared national
policy." (Art VI, sec. 26, 1935 Constitution.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision is copied verbatim in the 1973 Charter except for
the reference to the Prime Minister instead of to the President and the
addition of the following sentence indicating more emphatically the temporary
nature of the delegation:</p>

<blockquote>"Unless sooner withdrawn by resolution of the National
Assembly, such powers shall cease upon its next adjournment." (Section 15,
Article VIII, 1973 Constitution of the Philippines.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The point that immediately surges to the mind upon a reading of
this provision is that in times of war or other national emergency it is
definitely to the Executive that the people thru the fundamental law entrust
the running of the government, either by delegation of the legislative power to
him thru an express enactment of the Legislature to that effect or by direct
authorization from the Constitution itself to utilize all the powers of
government should he find it necessary to place the country or any part thereof
under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additional evidence
of such clear intent is the fact that in the course of the deliberations in the
Constitutional Convention of 1934 of the proposal to incorporate the above
provision in the charter, Delegate Wenceslao Vinzons of Camarines Norte moved
to delete the same for fear that the concentration of powers in one man may
facilitate the emergence of a dictatorship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said in part:</p>

<blockquote>"The power to promulgate rules and regulations in times of
emergency or war is not recognized in any constitution except, perhaps, the
Constitution of Denmark, which provides that in case of special urgency the
King may, when the Reichstag is not in session, issue laws of temporary
application. Such laws, however, shall not be contrary to the Constitution, and
they shall be submitted to the Reichstag in its next session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, even in a kingdom like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Denmark</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the powers of the King are limited in times of emergency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the Constitution we are drafting now, there is
absolutely no limit except when the National Assembly specifies at the
inception of the grant of power.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I want to warn, Mr. President, of a future condition in our
Republic when we shall no longer be under the tutelage of any foreign power,
when we shall have to work for our own destiny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I want to say that I am not very positive in stating here that we shall
have a dictatorship because the structure of the government that we are
creating permits its establishment, but the power to promulgate rules and
regulations will give rise to a strong man who may, in a desire to gratify his
personal ambitions, seize the reins of government." (Page 391, Volume
Five, The Philippine Constitution, Its Origins, Making, Meaning, and
Application, a publication of the Philippine Lawyers Association, 1972.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Despite such eloquent warning, the
assembly voted down his motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now contended that instead of declaring martial law,
President Marcos should have sought from Congress the approval of an emergency
powers act similar to Commonwealth Acts 600 and 671 passed respectively on
August 19, 1940, long before the Japanese invasion, and December 16, 1941, when
the Nippon Army was already on its way to Manila from Lingayen and other
landing points in the North.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, Congress was not unaware of the worsening
conditions of peace and order and of, at least, evident insurgency, what with
the numerous easily verifiable reports of open rebellious activities in
different parts of the country and the series of rallies and demonstrations,
often bloody, in Manila itself and other centers of population, including those
that reached not only the portals but even the session hall of the legislature,
but the legislators seemed not to be sufficiently alarmed or they either were
indifferent or did not know what to do under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of taking immediate measures to
alleviate the conditions denounced and decried by the rebels and the activists,
they debated and argued long on palliatives without coming out with anything
substantial, much less satisfactory in the eyes of those who were seditiously
shouting for reforms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, in
the face of the inability of Congress to meet the situation, and prompted by
his appraisal of a critical situation that urgently called for immediate
action, the only alternative open to the President was to resort to the other
constitutional source of extraordinary powers, the Constitution itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that Commonwealth Act 671 granted the
President practically all the powers of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence
of war between the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and other countries of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>,
which involves the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
makes it necessary to invest the President with extraordinary powers in order
to meet the resulting emergency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to
the provisions of Article VI, section 16, of the Constitution, the President is
hereby authorized, during the existence of the emergency, to promulgate such
rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out the national policy
declared in section 1 hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
he is, among other things, empowered (a) to transfer the seat of the Government
or any of its subdivisions, branches, departments, offices, agencies or
instrumentalities; (b) to reorganize the Government of the Commonwealth
including the determination of the order of precedence of the heads of the
Executive Departments; (c) to create new subdivisions, branches, departments,
offices, agencies or instrumentalities of government and to abolish any of
those already existing; (d) to continue in force laws and appropriations which
would lapse or otherwise become inoperative, and to modify or suspend the
operation or application of those of an administrative character; (e) to impose
new taxes or to increase, reduce, suspend, or abolish those in existence; (f)
to raise funds through the issuance of bonds or otherwise, and authorize the
expenditure of the proceeds thereof; (g) to authorize the National, provincial,
city or municipal governments to incur in overdrafts for purposes that he may
approve; (h) to declare the suspension of the collection of credits or the
payment of debts; and (i) to exercise such other powers as he may deem
necessary to enable the Government to fulfill its responsibilities and to
maintain and enforce its authority.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall as soon as practicable upon the convening of the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
report thereto all the rules and regulations promulgated by him under the
powers herein granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This act shall
take effect upon its approval, and the rules and regulations promulgated
hereunder shall be in force and effect until the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall otherwise provide."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">From this extensive grant of immense
powers, it may be deduced that the difference between martial law and the
delegation of legislative power could be just a matter of procedure in that the
investment of authority in the former is by the Constitution while in the
latter it is by the Legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
resulting constitutional situation is the same in both — government by the
Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be said that even the
primacy of military assistance in the discharge of government responsibilities
would be covered by the exercise of the delegated authority from Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is most important, however, is that the Constitution does
not prohibit the declaration of martial law just because of the authority given
to the Legislative to invest the Executive with extraordinary powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be supposed that in the face of
the inability or refusal of the Legislature to act, the people should be left helpless
and without a government to cope with the emergency of an internal or external
aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less is it logical to
maintain that it is the Supreme Court that is called upon to decide what
measures should be taken in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the fundamental law looks to the Executive to make the choice of
the means not only to repel the aggression but, as a necessary consequence, to
undertake such curative measures and reforms as are immediately available and
feasible to prevent the recurrence of the causes of the emergency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are capitalizing on the pronouncements of this Court
in Lansang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel, however, that such
excessive reliance is not altogether well placed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The exact import of the Lansang doctrine is that it is within the
constitutional prerogative of the Supreme Court to inquire into the veracity of
the factual bases recited by the Executive in a proclamation ordering the
suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, for the
purpose of determining whether or not the Executive acted arbitrarily in
concluding from the evidence before him that there was indeed a rebellion and
that public necessity, as contemplated in the Constitution, required such
suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, We held
therein that the issue of legality or illegality of a proclamation suspending
the Privilege is a justiciable one, in regard to which the Court could make
independent findings based on the evidence on which the President himself
acted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, however, no real
hearing was held for the purpose in<i> </i>that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What might perhaps be considered as such a
hearing was what took place on October 28 and 29, 1971, when, because of the
willingness expressed by the respondents therein to impart to the Court
classified information relevant to the cases, subject to appropriate security
measures, the Court met behind closed doors, and in the presence of three
attorneys representing the petitioners therein and the Solicitor General, it
was briefed by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and other ranking
military officials on said classified information, after which the parties were
granted time to file their respective memoranda of observations on the matters
revealed in the briefing, which they did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See 42 SCRA, at pp. 466-467).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the present cases there has been no such hearing, not even a briefing wherein
petitioners were represented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is
gravely doubtful whether any move in that direction would prosper, considering
there are not enough members of the Court, who believe in the juridical relevance
thereof, to constitute the required majority for a binding action to order such
a hearing or even just a similar briefing as before.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, the important point is that Lansang case
referred to the extent of the powers of the Court in regard to a proclamation
suspending the Privilege whereas what is before Us now is a proclamation
imposing martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the
powers of the Executive involved in the two proclamations are not of the same
constitutional level and the prerogatives of the Court relative to <i>habeas
corpus</i> are distinct from those in the perspective of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, it is too evident to admit of dispute that the
aforequoted constitutional provision touching on the three powers of the
Executive, the calling of the armed forces, the suspension of the privilege and
the imposition of martial law contemplates varying and ascending degrees of
lawlessness and public disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
it is true that textually any of the three courses of action mentioned may be
taken by the Executive on the occasion of an invasion, insurrection or
rebellion, the degree of resulting repression of individual rights under each
of them varies so substantially that it cannot be doubted that the constitution
contemplates that the determination as to which of them should be taken should
depend on the degree of gravity of the prevailing situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is the actual magnitude of
the rebellion to be suppressed and the degree and extent of danger to public
safety resulting therefrom that determines whether it should be the first, the
second or the third that should be taken, in order that there may be a direct
proportion between the degree of gravity of the crisis and the restraint of
individual rights and liberties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the situation is not very serious but is nevertheless beyond the control of the
regular peace authorities of the place affected, then the armed forces can be
called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the conditions
deteriorate in such a way as to involve a considerable segment of the population,
thereby making it difficult to maintain order and to differentiate the loyal
from the disloyal among the people, without detaining some of them, either
preventively or for their delivery to the proper authorities after the
emergency or as soon as it eases, then the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> may also be suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the moment the situation assumes very serious proportions, to the extent that
there is a breakdown of the regular government machinery either because the
officials cannot physically function or their functioning would endanger public
safety, martial law may be imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is thus a marked gradation of the circumstances constituting
rebellion and danger to public safety in the provision, and it is to be
supposed that the measure to be adopted by the Executive should be that which
the situation demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The calling of the armed forces is done by the Executive in his
capacity as Commander-in-Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
power thus exercised is purely executive and does not cause any disturbance in
the constitutional order in the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of suspension of the Privilege, individual rights guaranteed
by the Bill of Rights are restrained, but otherwise the regular constitutional
machinery and the powers and functions of the different officials of the
government, including the courts, remain unaffected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the suspension of the Privilege,
although premised on the demand of public safety, need not be necessarily
predicated on the requirements of national security as should be the case with
martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the power exercised
in suspension is executive power and nothing more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when martial law is proclaimed, there is,
as already observed earlier, a surrogation of the regular government machinery
by the constitutionally designated administrator with the aid of the
military.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is exercised in this
instance is not executive power alone but state power which involves the
totality of government authority, but without an actual military takeover, if
only because the civilian President remains at the head.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it is very important to note that whereas the
Bill of Rights explicitly prohibits the suspension of the Privilege of the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i> except under the detailed circumstances prescribed
therein, including the limitations as to the time and place when and where it
may stay suspended, there is no similar injunction in regard to the imposition
of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
grant of the power to declare martial law in the Executive portion of the
Constitution is not countered, unlike in the case of <i>habeas corpus</i>, by a
prohibition in the Bill of Rights, the sanctuary of individual liberties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Invoking Lansang, petitioners argue that if an order of
suspension of the Privilege which involves less repression of constitutional
processes than martial law is reviewable by the courts, with more reason should
the imposition of martial law, whose effect upon the constitutional rights and
processes is more pervasive, be subject to a judicial test of constitutionality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewing it from the angle of individual
rights, the argument sounds plausible, but when it is considered that the
framers of the Bill of Rights never bothered to put the same or any similar
brakes to the imposition of martial law as that which they placed in regard to
suspension, it can be readily seen that because of the gravity of the crisis
predicating the extreme remedy of martial law, the constitution itself makes
the invocation of individual rights subordinate to the national interest involved
in the defense of the state against the internal aggression that confronts
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this consideration, it follows
that whatever standard of constitutionality was established by the Court in
Lansang relative to Suspension is not necessarily the measure of the powers the
Court can exercise over the Executive's proclamation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Constitution purposely and with good
reason differentiates, the Court may not equate.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, We do not believe this is the proper occasion for
the Court to alter or modify what We said in Lansang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that We say here is that Lansang does not
reach the martial law powers of the Executive, if only because that case
involved exclusively the question of legality of the detention, during the
Suspension, of some individuals, the petitioners therein, whereas here We are
dealing with the deprivation of liberty of petitioners as a direct consequence
of martial law, and in effect the real question before Us now is the legality
of the martial law regime itself, which, as already demonstrated, occupies a
different, level in the constitutional order of Executive power, specially when
considered from the point of view of the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if We must refer to the considerations of the Court in
formulating Lansang, We cannot disregard the impact of contemporary
constitutional developments related thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitutional Convention of 1971 had barely started its relevant
deliberations when Lansang was decided.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be assumed that the delegates were well informed about its
import.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, they must have focused
their attention thereto when martial law was proclaimed in September of 1972,
if only because some of the delegates were apprehended and detained and had
forthwith filed the petitions now pending before Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates knew or ought to have known
that under the existing Constitution, the Bill of Rights made no mention of the
possible imposition of martial law in the section prohibiting the suspension of
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of seeing to it that in the charter
they were drafting the prohibition as to <i>habeas corpus</i> should be
extended to the declaration of martial law, in order to make the contingency
thereof as difficult as in the case of the former, they evidently found more
reason to concur in the construction pursued by President Marcos of the
prerogatives which the Constitution empowers him to utilize during a rebellion
or invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, to erase
further doubts on the matter, the Convention enacted the transitory provision
earlier referred to making the Proclamation, among others, part of the law of
the land, which provision, We deem, at this point, not as a fiat placing the
Proclamation definitely beyond the pale of unconstitutionality, but as a contemporary
authoritative construction of the current charter by the body precisely called
to examine it carefully and determine its defects that should be corrected, to
the end that the rights of the people may be best safeguarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, such construction is entitled to due
respect from Us, particularly because it has been in effect, if not directly,
approved by the people, not only in the referendum of January 10-15, 1973
assailed by petitioners but in the other one held by secret ballot on July
27-28, 1973 under the supervision of the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the light of such construction, Our
considered view is that Lansang is not controlling on the issues regarding
martial law involved in these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perhaps, it may not be amiss to add here that although the
records of the Constitutional Convention of 1934 do not reveal the actual
reasons for the rejection of the amendment proposed by Delegate Vicente J.
Francisco to include in the Bill of Rights provision regarding <i>habeas corpus</i>
the reference made to imminent danger of invasion, insurrection or rebellion in
the enumeration of the powers of the Executive relative to the same subject, it
is quite possible that in the mind of the convention it was not absolutely
necessary to suspend the Privilege when the danger is only imminent unless the
element of public safety involved already requires the imposition of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relatedly, Delegate Araneta who as
earlier mentioned, proposed to subject the suspension of the Privilege to
legislative or judicial concurrence or review, and who appeared to be the most
bothered, among the delegates, about the exertion of executive power during the
emergencies contemplated, never said a word against the manner in which the
Executive was being granted the authority to impose martial law, much less
proposed any restriction upon it the way he did with the suspension of the
Privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This goes to show that the
feeling in the assembly was to regard martial law differently from the
suspension and to recognize that its imposition should not be trammeled nor
shackled by any provision of the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">— 6 —</p>

<p class="BODY">There are insurmountable pragmatic obstacles to the theory of
justiciability sustained by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most important of this is that there is no known or
recognized procedure which can be adopted in the proposed inquiry into the
factual bases of the Executive's proclamation to insure that the degree of
judicious and fair hearing and determination of facts might be
approximated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, the ordinary
rules of pleading, practice and evidence are out of the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relevant elemental facts are scattered
throughout the length and breadth of the country, and there is no conceivable
judicial camera that can catch the whole picture with adequate fidelity to the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps judicial notice can help,
but the elements of public safety are not properly susceptible of judicial
notice when it comes to covert subversive activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problems of demonstration are manifold,
and when it is borne in mind that, in the very nature of things and under
universally accepted norms of state protection, there is a wall, impenetrable
even to the judiciary, behind which the state rightfully keeps away from other
Departments matters affecting national security, one will realize the futility
of believing that the Court can, assuming it were, by some curious way of
reasoning, legally required to do so, properly perform its judicial attributes
when it comes to determining in the face of an apparently nationwide rebellion,
whether or not martial law should be proclaimed by the Executive, instead of
resorting to the lesser remedies of calling the armed forces or suspending the
Privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, for the Court to be
able to decide whether or not the action of the Executive is arbitrary, it
must, in justice to both parties, and to him in particular, act in the light of
the same evidence from which he drew his conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can such evidence be all gathered and
presented to the Court?</p>

<p class="BODY">Some members of the Court are of the firm conviction that it is
Our constitutional duty to indulge in the suggested inquiry, so We can be
assured in Our own conscience, and for the protection of the people, whether or
not President Marcos has acted arbitrarily.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But prescinding from the difficulties of demonstration just discussed,
from what evidence is the Court going to draw its own conclusions in the cases
at bar, when We have not even been told what evidence the President had before
him, except those that may be inferred from the whereases of the Proclamation
which are disputed by petitioners?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, how can We have all the evidence before Us, when in the very
nature thereof We cannot have access to them, since they must be kept under the
forbidding covers of national security regulations?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the standing ordinary rules of evidence
provide in this respect thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Privileged</i>
<i>communication</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>—</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A public officer
cannot be examined during his term of office or afterwards, as to
communications made to him in official confidence, when the court finds that
the public interest would suffer by the disclosure." (Rule 130, Revised
Rules of Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The inevitable conclusion is that the
Constitution must have intended that the decision of the Executive should be
his alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">If We should hold that the matter before Us is justiciable, the
practical result would be that even if the Court should now decide in the style
of Lansang that the President did not act arbitrarily in issuing the
Proclamation, We would have to be ready to entertain future petitions, one
after the other, filed by whosoever may be minded to allege, for his own
purpose, that conditions have so improved as to warrant the lifting of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, every now and then the
Court would have to hear the parties and evaluate their respective
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government would have to
appear and prove all over again the justifications for its action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consequence would be that instead of
devoting his time to the defense of the nation, the President would be
preparing himself for the court battle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is ridiculous to think that the members of the Constitutional Convention
had conceived placing such difficulties in the way of the Executive which make
of his function of defending the state a continuous running battle in two
separate fronts, one with the enemy and another with the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is suggested that the Court can summarily
dismiss any such future petitions in cavalier fashion by simply holding on to
the finding We would make in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But new allegations and arguments are bound to be made, and it is
definitely improper for Us to just summarily uphold the Executive everytime a
case comes up.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more absurd is that the Supreme Court is not the only
court in which a petition to lift may be filed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Imagine if petitions were filed in two or three Courts of First
Instance, what would happen?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, We are in no position to enjoin the lower courts to entertain such
petitions because they may refer to the proposed lifting of martial law only in
the respective provinces where the courts are, and We cannot hold, precisely
because of Our own characterization of the nature of the issue as justiciable,
or more simply, that the Proclamation is subject to the review of factual bases
by the court, that any of said courts is without jurisdiction to entertain the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, every court
would then be open to pass on the reasonability or arbitrariness of the
President's refusal or failure to lift martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not mean to insinuate that the lower
court judges may not be prepared for the purpose, but the spectacle alone of
several of such petitions pending in various courts, without visualizing
anymore the potentiality of one judge or another upholding the proponent, is
something that will not only foreseeably complicate our international relations
but will also detract from our image as a people trained in the field of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of these considerations suggest again
that it is best that the Judiciary abstain from assuming a role not clearly
indicated in the Constitution to pertain to it.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">-C-</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">THE SUPREME COURT ABSTAINS
FROM REVIEWING PROCLAMATION 1081, BECAUSE, IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONSIDERATIONS
HEREIN DISCUSSED, IT IS CONVINCED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CONTEMPLATES THAT THE
DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY SOLELY OF THE
EXECUTIVE, BUT SHOULD ANY OCCASION OF OPEN DEFIANCE AND MANIFEST DISREGARD OF
THE PERTINENT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ARISE, THE COURT IS NOT POWERLESS TO
"SUPPORT AND DEFEND" THE CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p class="BODY">The greatest fear entertained by those who would sustain the
Court's authority to review the action of the President is that there might be
occasions when an Executive drunk with power might without rhyme or reason
impose martial law upon the helpless people, using the very Constitution itself
as his weapon of oppression to establish here a real dictatorship or
totalitarian government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view is that
it is only the Supreme Court that can prevent such a dismal eventuality by
holding that it has the final authority and inescapable duty to define the
constitutional boundaries of the powers of the Executive and to determine in
every case properly brought before it whether or not any such power has been
abused beyond the limits set down by the fundamental law, and that unless We
hold here that the Court can determine the constitutional sufficiency of
Proclamation 1081 in fact and in law, the Filipino people would have no
protection against such an abusive Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">We here declare emphatically that such apprehension is definitely
unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, in this decision,
We are holding that the Court has the jurisdiction, the power and the authority
to pass on any challenge to an Executive's declaration of martial law alleged
in a proper case affecting private or individual rights to be unwarranted by
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these cases,
however, we do not see any need for the interposition of our authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead what appears clear to Us, in the
light of the considerations We have discussed above, and so We hold, is that
the Solicitor General is eminently correct in contending that in the circumstantial
and constitutional milieu of the impugned Proclamation, We should abstain from
conducting the suggested inquiry to determine their constitutional sufficiency.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the way We see the martial law provision of the Constitution,
only two hypotheses can be considered relative to the Constitutional problem
before Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either the Executive acts in
conformity with the provision or he does not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, either he imposes martial law because there is actually
a rebellion endangering the public safety or he does it for his own personal
desire to grab power, notwithstanding the absence of the factual grounds
required by the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
latter case, the Court would have the constitutional power and duty to declare
the proclamation issued null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But to do this it does not have to conduct a judicial inquiry by the
reception of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
guided solely by facts that are of judicial notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if the predicative recitals of the
proclamation are confirmed by facts of general public knowledge, obviously any
further inquiry would be superfluous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, in the contrary hypothesis, that is, it is publicly and
generally known that there is no rebellion of the nature and extent
contemplated in the Constitution, no amount of evidence offered by the
Executive can judicially create such a rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as observed elsewhere in this
opinion, a rebellion that does not come to the judicial notice of the Court
cannot warrant the imposition of martial law, particularly in reference to one
imposed over the whole country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But once
it is known to the Court by judicial notice that there is a rebellion, it would
constitute an undue interference with the constitutional duties and
prerogatives of the Executive for the Court to indulge in an inquiry as to the
constitutional sufficiency of his decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not public safety requires the drastic action of imposing
martial law already involves the exercise of judgment, which as far as We can
see is committed to the responsibility of the Executive as the protector and
defender of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our considered
view is that in such circumstances, the Constitution rather expects the Court
to defer to his decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this
concept of the powers of the Court relative to the exercise by the Executive of
his martial law prerogatives, the Court does not relinquish its authority as
guardian of the Constitution and the Executive, guided solely by his own sense
of responsibility under his solemn oath "to defend and preserve" the
Constitution, can proceed with his task of saving the integrity of the
government and the nation, without any fear that the Court would reverse his
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, it could have sufficed for Us to point out, in answer
to the contention about possible abuse, that it is axiomatic in constitutional
law that the possibility that an official might abuse the powers conferred upon
him by law or by the Charter does not mean that the power does not exist or
should not be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
affirmed this principle not only in <i>Barcelon vs. Baker</i>, quoted supra,
which was the precursor perhaps of the extreme of judicial self-restraint or
abstention in this jurisdiction but even in <i>Angara vs. Electoral Commission</i>,
63 Phil. 139, reputedly the vanguard of judicial activism in the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Laurel postulated
reassuringly on this point in <st1:place>Angara</st1:place> thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The possibility of abuse is not an
argument against the concession of power as there is no power that is not
susceptible of abuse" (at p. 177).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And We could have complemented this ratiocination with the observation
that it is most unlikely that the Filipino people would be penalized by Divine
Providence with the imposition upon them of an Executive with the frightening
characteristics ominously portrayed by those who advocate that the Court,
assuming its own immunity from being abusive, arbitrary or improvident, should
not recognize any constitutionally envisioned deference to the other
Departments of the Government, particularly the Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can feel, however, that the people need further
reassurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score, it is
opportune to recall that in <i>Avelino vs. Cuenco</i>, 83 Phil. 68, in spite of
the fact that in the Resolution of March 4, 1949, this Court refused to
intervene in the controversy between the parties as to whether or not there was
a valid election of a new President of the Senate, upon the ground that the
issue involved was purely political, in the subsequent Resolution of March 14,
1949, upon realizing that a critical situation, detrimental to the national
interest, subsisted as a consequence of its abstention, the Court reversed
itself and assumed the power to state categorically the correct solution to the
conflict based on its interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in January, 1962, in the space of several hours, 350 appointments
to different positions in the government, including Justices of the Supreme
Court and of the Court of Appeals and judges of the lower courts, fiscals,
officers of the Army, directors of bureaus, Governor of the Central Bank, and
others were sent by the President then to the Commission on Appointments on
December 29, 1961, the day preceding his last half-day in office, December 30,
1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the said appointments being
impugned in the Supreme Court, the Court, aghast by the number of and the speed
in the making of said appointments, the fact that they were made under
circumstances that betrayed not only lack of proper and deliberate
consideration of the qualifications of the appointees but also an evident
intent to deprive the succeeding President from filling the vacancies that had
been left vacant even after the results showing the defeat of the incumbent
President had already been publicly known and conceded, the departure from long
established practices in their preparation as well as the other undesirable
circumstances that surrounded the same, promptly struck them down as the
product of an improvident exercise of power, obnoxious to the precepts
underlying the principled government conceived in the Constituion.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a>
The violation of the spirit and intent of the Constitution appeared manifest to
the Court on the basis of facts which were mainly if not all of judicial notice
and, therefore, needed no further demonstration in an inquiry or investigation
by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under more or less a
similar setting of circumstances, which occurred in the latter part of the term
of the President whose tenure expired on December 30, 1965, the Supreme Court
reiterated the above ruling in <i>Guevara vs. Inocentes</i>, 16 SCRA 379.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus everyone can see that when situations arise which on their
faces and without the need of inquiry or investigation reveal an unquestionable
and palpable transgression of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has never
been without means to uphold the Constitution, the policy of judicial self-restraint
implicit therein notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
precedents just related relate to peaceful controversies, and, of course, the
alleged violation of the Constitution by the Executive in the exercise of a
power granted to him to meet the exigencies of rebellion and the dangers to
public safety it entails has to be considered from a different
perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then, the Supreme
Court would not be powerless to act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Until all of its members are incarcerated or killed and there are not
enough of them to constitute a quorum, the Court would always be there ready to
strike down a proclamation of martial law as unconstitutional, whenever from
the facts manifest and generally known to the people and to it, and without its
having conducted any inquiry by the reception of evidence, it should appear
that the declaration is made without any rational basis whatsoever and is
predicated only on the distorted motives of the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as long, however, as the recitals or
grounds given in a proclamation accord substantially with facts of judicial
notice, either because they are of public knowledge or are by their nature
capable of unquestionable demonstration, We have no reason to interfere with
the discharge by the Executive of a responsibility imposed upon him by the Constitution
and in which there is no indication therein that the Court should share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when, as just stated, it is generally
known or it is of public knowledge that there is no rebellion or, there being
one, that it poses no conceivable danger to the public safety, and, God forbid,
martial law is proclaimed, the Court, even without the need of any kind of
judicial inquiry into the facts alleged in the proclamation, will certainly act
and declare the pretentious Executive a constitutional outlaw, with the result
that the regular government established by the Constitution may continue in the
hands of those who are constitutionally called upon to succeed him, unless he
overcomes the legitimate government by force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In truth, such is the only way the Supreme Court should act in
discharging its duty to uphold the Constitution by the use of the judicial
power, if it is to give to the Executive or the Legislature, as the case may
be, the due regard that the Constitution contemplates should be accorded to
them in consideration of their own functions and responsibilities implicit in
the principle of separation of powers embodied therein.</p>

<blockquote>THE CONSTITUTION IS MERELY IN A STATE OF <st1:state><st1:place>ANAESTHESIA</st1:place></st1:state>,
SINCE A MAJOR SURGERY IS NEEDED TO SAVE THE NATION'S LIFE.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussion covers, as must have been noted, the
resolution not only of the issue of jurisdiction raised by the respondents but
also of the corollary question of the application of the Lansang doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that, from what has been said, it is
obvious that since it is to the President that the Constitution has committed
the discretion to impose martial law, it follows that he alone should have the
discretion and the prerogative to declare when it should cease or be
lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exactly the same considerations
compelling the conclusion that the Court may not review the constitutional
sufficiency of his proclamation of martial law make it ineludible to conclude
that the people have also left it to the Executive to decide when conditions
would permit the full restoration of the regular constitutional processes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With characteristic perceptive insight, in
his thesis to be cited <i>infra</i>, Justice Guillermo S. Santos of the Court
of Appeals, discourses on this point as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"44. <i>When Martial Rule is
Terminated</i> -</blockquote>

<blockquote>In both <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
martial rule terminates <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> upon the cessation of the
public emergency that called it forth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this proposition there has been no dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial rule must cease when the public
safety no longer require its further exercise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"45. <i>Who Terminates Martial Rule</i>
-</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the declaration of martial rule has been committed to the
judgment of the President, it follows that its termination is to be fixed by
the same authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Barcelon <i>vs</i>.
Baker, 1905, 5 Phil. 87.) Again, to this view there cannot be any valid
objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem only natural
that since the President has been expressly authorized to declare martial rule
no other authority should be permitted to terminate it." (Martial Law,
Nature, Principles and Administration by Guillermo S. Santos, p. 75.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Needless to say, it is our Constitution
that controls in the cases at bar, not the American theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when President Laurel proclaimed
martial law during the Second World War, he expressly provided, to avoid any
doubt about the matter, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proclamation
of martial law being an emergency measure demanded by imperative necessity, it
shall continue as long as the need for it exists and shall terminate upon
proclamation of the President of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the interest of truth and to set Our perspective aright, it
may not be said that under Proclamation 1081 and the manner in which it has
implemented, there has been a total suspension, much less an abrogation of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even textually, the
ensuing orders issued by the President have left virtually unaltered the
established constitutional order in all levels of government and society except
those that have to be adjusted and subjected to potential changes demanded by
the necessities of the situation and the attainment of the objectives of the
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Repeatedly and
emphatically, the President has solemnly reassured the people that there is no
military takeover and that the declared principle in the Constitution that
"Civilian authority is at all times supreme over the military"
(Section 8, Article II, 1973 Charter) shall be rigorously observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And earlier in this opinion, We have already
discussed how he restored the security of tenure of the members of the Court
and how the judicial power has been retained by the courts, except in those
cases involving matters affecting national security and public order and safety
which the situation demands should be dealt with by the executive arms of the
government.</p>

<p class="BODY">When President Lincoln proclaimed martial law in <st1:state><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:state>
in 1864, he did not completely overhaul the existing machinery, he let it
continue insofar as it did not obstruct the military operations and related
activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ordered thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Whereas many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined
the forces of the insurgents, and such insurgents have, on several occasions,
entered the said State of Kentucky in large force, and, not without aid and
comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States
residing therein, have not only disturbed the public peace, but have overborne
the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life
in various parts of the State:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
whereas it has been made known to the President of the United States by the
officers commanding the national armies, that combinations have been formed in
the said State of Kentucky with a purpose of inciting rebel forces to renew the
said operations of civil war within the said State, and thereby to embarrass
the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and
Georgia, and even to endanger their safety:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x x 'The martial law herein proclaimed, and the things in that respect
herein ordered, will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of
lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of
Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing
therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do
not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the
government of the United States." (Martial Law, Nature, Principles and
Administration by Guillermo S. Santos, pp. 97-98.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Incidentally, there is here a clear repudiation
of the open court theory, and what is more, even the holding of regular
elections and legislative sessions were not suppressed.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a>
Accordingly, the undeniable fact that the Philippine Congress was in session,
albeit about to adjourn, when martial law was declared on September 21, 1972 is
not necessarily an argument against the exercise by the President of the power
to make such a declaration.</p>

<p class="BODY">President Laurel's own declaration of martial law during the
Japanese occupation did not involve a total blackout of constitutional
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads in its pertinent
portions thus:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All existing laws
shall continue in force and effect until amended or repealed by the President,
and all the existing civil agencies of an executive character shall continue
exercising their powers and performing their functions and duties, unless they
are inconsistent with the terms of this Proclamation or incompatible with the
expeditious and effective enforcement of martial law herein declared.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It shall be the duty
of the Military Governors to suppress treason, sedition, disorder and violence;
and to cause to be punished all disturbances of public peace and all offenders
against the criminal laws; and also to protect persons in their legitimate
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this end and until otherwise
decreed, the existing courts of justice shall assume jurisdiction and try
offenders without unnecessary delay and in a summary manner, in accordance with
such procedural rules as may be prescribed by the Minister of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions of courts of justice of the
different categories in criminal cases within their original jurisdiction shall
be final and unappealable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Provided,
however</i>, That no sentence of death shall be carried into effect without the
approval of the President.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The existing courts of
justice shall continue to be invested with, and shall exercise, the same
jurisdiction in civil actions and special proceedings as are now provided in
existing laws, unless otherwise directed by the President of the Republic of the
Philippines."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Proclamation 1081 is in no sense any more constitutionally
offensive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in ordering
detention of persons, the Proclamation pointedly limits arrests and detention
only to those "presently detained, as well as all others who may hereafter
be similarly detained for the crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and all
other crimes and offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof,
or incident thereto, or in connection therewith, for crimes against national
security and the laws of nations, crimes against public order, crimes involving
usurpation of authority, rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms and
insignia, crimes committed by public officers, and for such other crimes as
will be enumerated in orders that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as
crimes as a consequence of any violation of any decree, order or regulation
promulgated by me personally or promulgated upon my direction."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, even in the affected areas, the Constitution has not been
really suspended much less discarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
contemplated in the fundamental law itself, it is merely in a state of anaesthesia,
to the end that the much needed major surgery to save the nation's life may be
successfully undertaken.</p>

<blockquote>THE IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL LAW AUTOMATICALLY
CARRIES WITH IT THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRIVILEGE OF THE WRIT OF <i>HABEAS
CORPUS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>IN ANY EVENT, THE
PRESIDENTIAL ORDER OF ARREST AND DETENTION CANNOT BE ASSAILED AS DEPRIVATION OF
<st1:city><st1:place>LIBERTY</st1:place></st1:city> WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The next issue to consider is that which refers to the arrest and
continued detention and other restraints of the liberties of petitioners, and
their main contention in this respect is that the proclamation of martial law
does not carry with it the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, hence petitioners are entitled to immediate release from their
constraints.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe such contention needs extended exposition or
elaboration in order to be overruled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The primary and fundamental purpose of martial law is to maintain order
and to insure the success of the battle against the enemy by the most
expeditious and efficient means without loss of time and with the minimum of
effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arrest and detention of those
contributing to the disorder and especially of those helping or otherwise
giving aid and comfort to the enemy are indispensable, if martial law is to
mean anything at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but
logical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To fight the enemy, to maintain
order amidst riotous chaos and military operations, and to see to it that the
ordinary constitutional processes for the prosecution of law-breakers are three
functions that cannot humanly be undertaken at the same time by the same
authorities with any fair hope of success in any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from Malcolm and Laurel, "Martial
law and the privilege of that writ (of habeas<i> </i>corpus) are wholly
incompatible with each other." (Malcolm and Laurel, Philippine
Constitutional Law, p. 210).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply
is not too much for the state to expect the people to tolerate or suffer
inconveniences and deprivations in the national interest, principally the
security and integrity of the country.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mere suspension of the Privilege may be ordered, as discussed
earlier, when the situation has not reached very critical proportions
imperilling the very existence of the nation, as long as public safety demands
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, absurd to contend,
that when martial law, which is precisely the ultimate remedy against the
gravest emergencies of internal or external aggression, is proclaimed, there is
no suspension of the Privilege unless this is separately and distinctly
ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that both powers
spring from the same basic causes, it stands to reason that the graver sanction
includes the lesser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed that
President Laurel treated the two matters separately in his aforequoted
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe that the
precedent cited controls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only proves
that to avoid any doubt, what President Laurel did may be adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no denying the point that
without suspension of the Privilege, martial law would certainly be
ineffective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since martial law involves
the totality of government authority, it may he assumed that by ordering the
arrest and detention of petitioners and the other persons mentioned in the
Proclamation, until ordered released by him, the President has by the tenor of
such order virtually suspended the Privilege. Relatedly, as pointed out by the
Solicitor General, no less than petitioner Diokno himself postulated in a
lecture at the U.P. Law Center that:</p>

<blockquote>"There are only, as far as I know, two instances where persons
may be detained without warrant but with due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is in cases of martial law or when
the <i>writ</i> <i>of habeas corpus</i> is suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those cases, it is not that their
detention is legal, it is that we cannot inquire into the legality of their
detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because martial law means
actually the suspension of law and the substitution of the will of our
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second instance is that
which is provided for in Rule 113, section 6 of the Rules of Court and Section
37 of the Revised Charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Essentially it consists of cases where the
crime is committed right in the presence of the person who is making the arrest
or detention." (Trial Problems in City &amp; Municipal Courts, 1970 p.
267, U.P. Law Center Judicial Conference Series.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his well documented and very carefully prepared and
comprehensive thesis on Martial Law, Nature, Principles and Administration,
Published by Central Lawbook Publishing Co. Inc. in 1972, Justice Guillermo S.
Santos of the Court of Appeals and formerly of the Judge Advocate General's
Service, Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
makes these pointed observations:</p>

<blockquote>"Whether the existence of martial law and the suspension of
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> ‘are one and the same thing',
or 'the former includes the latter and much more,' had been the subject of 'an
angry war of pamphlets between Professors Parsons and Parker of the Harvard Law
School at the outbreak of the Civil War.' (Fairman, p. 43; Wiener, p. 9.) It
has also been a difficult question to decide in some jurisdictions whether the
suspension of the privilege of the writ amounted to a declaration of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Winthrop, pp. 820 &amp; 828,
citing <i>Ex</i> <i>parte</i> Field, 9 Am. L.R. 507; Bouvier's Law Dictionary,
3rd Francis Rawis Ed., 1914, p. 2105, citing 1 Halleck, Int. Law 549.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the face of the constitutional provisions (Art. III, Sec.
1, Clause [14] and fn 9, supra.) in our jurisdiction, there seems to be no room
for doubt that the two are different.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the grounds for the suspension of the privilege of the writ and
the proclamation of martial law are the same, there can be no question that
suspension of the writ means what it says, that during the suspension of the
privilege, the writ, if issued, will be to no avail; but martial law has more
than just this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question
which apparently remains to be determined herein, is, whether the declaration
of martial law <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> carries with it the suspension of the
privilege of the writ, or whether a declaration of martial law must necessarily
include a declaration suspending the privilege of the writ in order to consider
the same inoperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it appears
that the former is the better view, (Malcolm and Laurel, Philippine
Constitutional Law, p. 310) although in United States it has been held that
qualified martial rule may exist where the writ has, in legal contemplation,
not been suspended, (Fairman, p. 44) and that the status of martial law does
not of itself suspend the writ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Military Law (Domestic Disturbances), Basic Field Manual, War
Department, [US] fn. 19 &amp; 15, p. 17 [1945].)" (See pp. 41-42.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Of course, We are not bound by the rule
in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Former Dean Vicente G. Sinco of the College of Law of the
University of the Philippines, of which he became later on President, a noted
authority on constitutional law from whom many of us have learned the subject,
likewise sustains the view that the proclamation of martial law automatically
suspends the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(V. Sinco, Phil. Political Law, p. 259, 11th
Ed., 1962)</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, as to the constitutional propriety of detaining persons on
suspicion of conspiracy with the enemy without the need of the regular judicial
process, We have also the authoritative support of no less than what a
distinguished member of this Court, considered as one of the best informed in
American constitutional law, Mr. Justice Enrique Fernando, and the principal
counsel of petitioners, former Senator Tañada, himself an authority, on the
subject, had to say on the point in their joint authorship, used as textbook in
many law schools, entitled Constitution of the Philippines, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Once martial law has been declared, arrest may be necessary
not so much for punishment but by way of precaution to stop disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as such arrests are made in good
faith and in the honest belief they are <u>needed to maintain order, the
President</u> as Commander-in-Chief, cannot thereafter, when he is out of
office, be subjected to an action on the ground that he had no reasonable
ground for his belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>When it comes
to a decision by the head of the state upon a matter involving its life, the
ordinary rights of individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities of
the moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public danger warrants the
substitution of executive process for judicial process</i>." (Emphasis
supplied. (Constitution of the Philippines by Tañada &amp; Fernando, Vol. 2.
pp. 523-525.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The authority cited by Justice Fernando and Senator Tañada says:</p>

<blockquote>'The plaintiff’s position, stated in a few words, is that the
action of the governor, sanctioned to the extent that it was by the decision of
the Supreme Court, was the action of the state and therefore within the 14th
Amendment; but that, if that action was unconstitutional, the governor got no
protection from personal liability for his unconstitutional interference with
the plaintiffs rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted,
as it must be, that the governor's declaration that a state of insurrection
existed is conclusive of that fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
seems to be admitted also that the arrest alone would not necessarily have
given a right to bring this suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luther
<i>vs. </i>Borden, 7 How. 1, 45, 46, 12 L. ed. 581, 600, 601.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is said that a detention for so many
days, alleged to be without probable cause, at a time when the courts were
open, without an attempt to bring the plaintiff before them, makes a case on
which he has a right to have a jury pass.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We shall not consider all of the questions that the facts
suggest, but shall confine ourselves to stating what we regard as a <u>sufficient
answer to the complaint, without</u> implying that there are not others equally
good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the plaintiff’s
position is that he has been deprived of his liberty without due process of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is familiar that what is due

did not make the averments of the petition for the writ averments of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts that we are to
assume are that a state of insurrection existed and that the governor, without
sufficient reason, but in good faith, in the course of putting the insurrection
down, held the plaintiff until he thought that he safely could release him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would seem to be admitted by the plaintiff that he was
president of the Western Federation of Miners, and that, whoever was to blame,
trouble was apprehended with the members of that organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We mention these facts not as material, but
simply to put in more definite form the nature of the occasion on which the
governor felt called upon to act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such
a situation we must assume that he had a right, under the state Constitution
and laws, to call out troops, as was held by the supreme court of the
state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution is supplemented
by an act providing that 'when an invasion of or insurrection in the state is
made or threatened, the governor shall order the national guard to repel or
suppress the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laws of 1897, chap.
83, art. 7, &amp; 2, p. 204.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That means
that he shall make the ordinary use of the soldiers to that end; that he may
kill persons who resist and, of course, that he may use the milder measure of
seizing the bodies of those whom he considers to stand in the way of restoring
peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such arrests are not necessarily
for punishment, but are by way of precaution, to prevent the exercise of
hostile power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as such arrests
are made in good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order
to head the insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be
subjected to an action after he is out of office, on the ground that he had not
reasonable ground for his belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we
suppose a governor with a very long term of office, it may be that a case could
be imagined in which the length of the imprisonment would raise a different
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there is nothing in the
duration of the plaintiff’s detention or in the allegations of the complaint
that would warrant submitting the judgment of the governor to revision by a
jury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not alleged that his
judgment was not honest, if that be material, or that the plaintiff was
detained after fears of the insurrection were at an end.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No doubt there are cases where the expert on the spot may be called
upon to justify his conduct later in court, notwithstanding the fact that he
had sole command at the time and acted to the best of his knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the position of the captain of a
ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, even in that case, great
weight is given to his determination, and the matter is to be judged on the
facts as they appeared then, and not merely in the light of the event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place><i>Lawrence</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>

<p class="BODY">Relatedly, in the decision of the Supreme Court of Colorado
dealing with the same detention of Charles II Moyer by order of the state
governor, it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"By the reply it is alleged that, notwithstanding the
proclamation and determination of the Governor that a state of insurrection
existed in the country of San Miguel, that as a matter of fact these conditions
did not exist at the time of such proclamation or the arrest of the petitioner,
or at any other time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By S 5, art. 4, of
our Constitution, the governor is the commander in chief of the military forces
of the state, except when they are called into actual service of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>; and he is thereby empowered to call
out the militia to suppress insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must therefore become his duty to determine as a fact when conditions
exist in a given locality which demand that, in the discharge of his duties as
chief executive of the state, he shall employ the militia to suppress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>This being true, the recitals in the
proclamation to the effect that a state of insurrection existed in the </i><st1:place><st1:placetype><i>county</i></st1:placetype><i>
 of </i><st1:placename><i>San Miguel</i></st1:placename></st1:place><i> cannot
be controverted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Otherwise, the
legality of the orders of the executive would not depend upon his judgment, but
the judgment of another coordinate branch of the state government . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>". . . <i>lf, then, the military may resort to the extreme of
taking human life in order to suppress insurrection, it is impossible to
imagine upon what hypothesis it can be</i> <i>successfully claimed that the
milder means</i> <i>of seizing the persons of those participating in the
insurrection or aiding and abetting it may not be resorted to</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but a lawful means to the end to be
accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power and authority of
the militia in such circumstances are not unlike that of the police of a city,
or the sheriff of a county, aided by his deputies or possee comitatus in
suppressing a riot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Certainly such
officials would be justified in arresting the rioters and placing them in jail
without warrant, and detaining them there until the riot was suppressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Hallett, J., in Re Application of Sherman
Parker (no opinion for publication).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>lf,
as contended by counsel for petitioner, the military, as soon as a rioter or
insurrectionist is arrested, must turn him over to the civil authorities of the
county, the arrest might, and in many instances would, amount to a mere farce.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could be released on bail, and left free
to again join the rioters or engage in aiding and abetting their action, and,
if again arrested, the same process would have to be repeated, and thus the
action of the military would be rendered a nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, if it be conceded that, on the arrest
of a rioter by the military, he must at once be turned over to the custody of
the civil officers of the county, then the military, in seizing armed
insurrectionists and depriving them of their arms, would be required to
forthwith return them to the hands of those who were employing them in acts of
violence; or be subject to an action of replevin for their recovery, whereby
immediate possession of such arms would be obtained by the rioters, who would
thus again be equipped to continue their lawless conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>To deny the right of the militia to detain
those whom they arrest while engaged in suppressing acts of violence and until
order is restored would lead to the most absurd results</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arrest and detention of an
insurrectionist, either actually engaged in acts of violence or in aiding and
abetting others to commit such acts, violates none of his constitutional
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not tried by any military
court, or denied the right of trial by jury; neither is he punished for
violation of the law, nor held without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>His arrest and detention in such
circumstances are merely to prevent him from taking part or aiding in a
continuation of the conditions which the governor, in the discharge of his
official duties and in the exercise of authority conferred by law, </i>is
endeavoring to suppress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this end
is reached, he could no longer be restrained of his liberty by the military,
but must be, just as respondents have indicated in their return to the writ,
turned over to the usual civil authorities of the county, to be dealt with in
the ordinary course of justice, and tried for such offenses against the law as
he may have committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that
petitioner is not held by virtue of any warrant, but if his arrest and
detention are authorized by law, he cannot complain because those steps have
not been taken which are ordinarily required before a citizen can be arrested
and detained.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>“…The same power which determines the existence of an
insurrection must also decide when the insurrection has been suppressed.” </i>(Emphasis
added.) (Re Moyer, 35 Colo. 159, 85 Pac. 190 [1904].)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is evident, therefore, that regardless
of whether or not the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is
expressly suspended during martial law, arrest, detention and other restraints
of liberty of individuals may not be assailed as violative of the due process
clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Presidential orders to such
effect constitute substantive and procedural due process at the same time and
may therefore be invoked as valid defenses against any remedy or prayer for
release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given the validity of the declaration
of martial law, the sole tests of legality of constraints otherwise frowned
upon in normal times by the fundamental law are substantial relevance and
reasonableness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the very nature of
things, and absent any obvious showing of palpable bad faith, the Executive
should enjoy respectful deference in the determination of his grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a rule, the Courts are not supposed to
make any inquiry into the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">We accordingly hold that, as well demonstrated by the Solicitor
General, a proclamation of martial law automatically results in the suspension
of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and, therefore, the
arrest, detention and restraints upon petitioners are authorized by the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the
Presidential order of arrest and detention constitute due process and is,
therefore, a valid defense to any allegation of illegality of the constraints
upon petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We further hold that
the duration of such constraints may be co-extensive with martial law unless
otherwise ordered by the Executive.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote><i>THE EFFECT OF THE APPROVAL AND RATIFICATION
OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION ON THE INSTANT PETITIONS<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All that remains now for resolution is the question of what
effect did the approval and ratification of the New Constitution have upon the
instant petitions?</p>

<p class="BODY">When petitioners came to this Court in September and October 1972
to impugn the legality of their arrest and detention by virtue of Proclamation
1081 and General Order No. 2, their common fundamental theory was that said
proclamation and order were violative of the Constitution of the Philippines of
1935, not only because, according to them, there was no justification for its
placing the country under martial law but also because, even assuming its
propriety, there was allegedly no legal basis for the apprehension and
detention of petitioners without any warrant of arrest and without even any
charges being filed against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
in his return of the writ of habeas<i> </i>corpus issued by the Court, as well
as in his oral argument at the hearings, the Solicitor General limited himself
to barely invoking the provision of the said Constitution empowering the
President to proclaim martial law, even as he denied the allegation that there
was no factual basis therefor, and simply contended that the arrest and
detention of petitioners were made pursuant to orders validly issued under the
powers of the President flowing from the proclamation.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">— A —</p>

<p class="BODY">As already noted, however, even before these cases could be
submitted for decision, on November 30, 1972, the Constitutional Convention of
1971 approved a draft constitution designed to supersede the Constitution of
1935 and on January 17, 1973, thru Proclamation 1102, the President declared
that draft constitution to have been ratified by the people in the referendum
of January 10-15, 1973, and, as also stated earlier, said proclamation became
the subject of two series of cases in this Court which ultimately ended with
the decision of March 31, 1973 adjudging that "there is no further
judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being considered in force and
effect." And among the salient and pertinent provisions of the New
Constitution or the Constitution of 1973 as the new charter may distinctively
be referred to, is that of Section 3 (2) of Article XVII textually reproduced
earlier above.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the comprehensive or all-inclusive tenor of the
constitutional injunction contained in said provision, referring as it does to
"all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated,
issued, or done by the incumbent President", there can be no doubt that
Proclamation 1081 and General Order No. 2, herein assailed by petitioners, are
among those enjoined to be "part of the law of the land." The
question that arises then is, did their having been made part of the law of the
land by no less than an express mandate of the fundamental law preclude further
controversy as to their validity and efficacy?</p>

<p class="BODY">In pondering over this question, it is important to bear in mind
the circumstances that attended the framing and final approval of the draft
constitution by the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
already noted, two actuations of the President of indubitable transcendental
import overtook the deliberation of the constituent assembly, namely, the
issuance by him of Proclamation 1081 placing the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under martial law and his exercise, under said proclamation, of non-executive
powers, inclusive of general legislative authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to be expected in a country, like the
Philippines, long accustomed to strict constitutionalism and the superiority of
civilian authority over the military, soon enough, these two actuations spawned
constitutional controversies of serious dimensions, so much so that several
cases involving them, including the instant ones, are now pending in the
Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the members of
the Convention were well aware of these developments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the delegates in convention
assembled were living witnesses of the manner in which, for the first time in
our constitutional history, the martial law clause of the charter was being
actually implemented and they knew the grave constitutional issues such
implementation had provoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, no constituent assembly could have been better
circumstanced to formulate the fundamental law of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Convention had a full and first-hand view
of the controversial operation of the most important part of the charter it was
called to improve upon — its martial law clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, no other aspect of the constitution
could have commanded more the most serious attention of the delegates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They knew or ought to have known that the
placing of the country or any part thereof under martial law could possibly
affect the continued operation therein of the constitution or at least, the
enforceability of particular provisions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, if the Convention felt that what
was being done by the President as witnessed by them was not within the
contemplation of the existing fundamental law or that it was inconsistent with
the underlying principles of democracy and constitutionalism to which the
nation has been irrevocably committed since its birth and which were to remain
as the foundations of the new charter, the delegates would have considered it
to be their bounden duty to our people and to the future generations of
Filipinos, to manifest their conviction by providing appropriate safeguards
against any repetition thereof in the constitution they were drafting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, when it is considered that as finally
approved, the New Constitution reproduces in exactly the same terms or verbatim
the martial law clause of the 1935 charter, the ineludible conclusion is that
our new constitutional fathers did not see anything repugnant to the concept of
the old constitution in what the President has done or was doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We see it, this attitude of the Convention
constitutes an authoritative contemporary construction of the provision in
controversy, and considering that the President's manner of implementing
martial law has been sanctioned by the people not only in the referendum of
January 10-15, 1973 but also in that of July 27-28, 1973, reliance on such
attitude in determining the meaning and intent of said provision cannot be out
of place.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these considerations, We do not see in the
transitory provision under discussion any idea of ratification or validation of
something void or unauthorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather,
what We perceive in it are revelations of what lay in the core of the martial
law clause of the 1935 Constitution as it was conceived and formulated by its
wise and farsighted framers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be
unreasonable, illogical and unworthy of the 1971 delegates to impute to them an
intent to merely ratify, confirm or validate the President's acts, on the
assumption that they were originally unauthorized by the charter, for that
would imply that they were concerned only about straightening out the present
situation, when it is just as important to insure that future acts of the
President are not tainted with illegality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot entertain any thought that the delegates were not sufficiently
apprised on the implications of their acts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the New Constitution has not imparted <i>ex propio vigore</i>
any element of validity to the acts in question, it has only expressed in black
and white what the Old Constitution did not deem necessary to lay down with
precision in respect to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewed
this way, what the transitory provision under discussion means is that both the
acts of the President before as well as those after ratification of the New
Constitution are valid ? not validated — and, as just stated, what reinforces
this construction and places the said acts beyond possible attacks for
unconstitutionality are the results of the two referendums of January and July,
1973.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, having absolute faith in the high sense of duty and the
patriotic courage of the members of the Convention, We also reject the
suggestion that they were in any way impeded, under the circumstances then
obtaining, from freely expressing themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot for a moment entertain the thought that any other Filipino can
ever have less courage and love of country and concern for the future of our
people than the members of this Court who are presently called upon to make
momentous decisions affecting no less than the legality and legitimacy of the
very Government admittedly in effective control of the whole territory of the
nation, regardless of possible personal consequences to themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact of the matter is that Proclamation 1081 did not make
mention of the Convention at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, judicial notice may be taken of the increased funds appropriated by
the President so as to enable it to proceed with its deliberations, unbothered
by any apprehension regarding the inadequacy of the funds which the Congress
had appropriated for it, and which were then fast dwindling, without any certainty
of further congressional appropriations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, when Delegate Kalaw of the First District of Rizal proposed in a
formal resolution that the sessions be suspended until after the lifting of
martial law, the assembly voted overwhelmingly to turn down the proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence at all that any form of
undue pressure was brought to bear upon the delegates in any respect related to
their constituent functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not
been shown that the arrest and detention of a number of delegates, some of whom
are petitioners herein, was in any way connected with or caused by their
actuations related to their constituent functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What General Order No. 2 asserts is that the
President ordered the "Secretary of National Defense to forthwith arrest
or cause the arrest and take into custody the individuals named in the attached
list (among them, the said delegates) and to hold them until otherwise so
ordered by me or my duly designated representative" for their "being
active participants or for having given aid and comfort in the conspiracy to
seize political and state power in the country and to take over the Government
by force, the extent of which has now assumed the proportion of an actual war
against our people and our legitimate Government and in order to prevent them
from further committing acts that are inimical or injurious to our people, the
Government and our national interest, and to hold said individuals until
otherwise so ordered by me or by my duly designated representative." Even
then, said delegates were allowed to cast their votes in the assembly when the
final draft was submitted for approval of the members of the Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it can be safely asserted that the
freedom of the Convention to act and to perform whatever was incumbent upon it
as a constituent body suffered no substantial diminution or constraint on
account of the proclamation of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">To reiterate then, Section 3 (2), Article XVII of the New
Constitution enjoins that "all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions
and acts promulgated, issued or done by the incumbent President shall be part
of the law of the land and shall remain valid, legal, binding and effective
even after the lifting of martial law or the ratification of this Constitution,
unless modified, revoked, or superseded by subsequent proclamations, orders,
decrees, instructions or other acts of the incumbent President, or unless
expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by the regular National
Assembly." Notably, the provision does not only make all such
proclamations, orders, decrees, etc. "part of the law of the land",
in which case, it would have been perhaps possible to argue, that they had just
been accorded the status of legislative enactments, ordinarily subject to possible
attack on constitutional grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provision actually goes further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
expressly ordains that the proclamations, orders, etc. referred to should
"remain valid, legal, binding, and effective" . . . until revoked,
modified, repealed or superseded in the manners therein stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the provision refers to and
contemplates not only proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions and acts of
executive character, but even those essentially legislative, as may be gathered
from the nature of the proclamations, decrees, orders, etc. already existing at
the time of the approval of the draft constitution and of the acceptance
thereof by the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, and
because there is no doubt that Proclamation 1081 and General Order No. 2,
herein challenged, are among the proclamations and orders contemplated in said
provision, the Court has no alternative but to hold, as it hereby holds, in
consonance with the authoritative construction by the Constitutional Convention
of the fundamental law of the land, that Proclamation 1081 of President Marcos
placing the Philippines under martial law as well as General Order No. 2,
pursuant to which petitioners are either in custody or restrained of their
freedoms "until otherwise so ordered by (the President) or (his) duly
designated representative" are valid, legal, binding and effective, and
consequently, the continued detention of petitioner Aquino as well as the
constraints on the freedoms of the other petitioners resulting from the
conditions under which they were released from custody are legal and
constitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel We are confirmed
in this conclusion by the results of the referendum of <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="7">July 27-28, 1973</st1:date> in which 18,052,016 voters gave
their affirmative approval to the following question:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the constitution the President, if he so desires, can
continue in office beyond 1973.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Do you want President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the
reforms he has initiated under Martial Law?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We hasten to add, to avoid misunderstanding or confusion of
concepts, that it is not because of the fiat or force of the New Constitution
itself that the transitory provision is being relied upon for the purposes of
the instant petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point,
and without prejudice to looking into the matter insofar as other issues and
other cases affecting martial law and the order issued under it are concerned,
all that We say is that the said provision constitutes an authoritative
contemporary construction of the martial law clause of the Constitution giving
light regarding the emergency powers that the Executive may exercise after its
proclamation.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">— B —</p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioner Diokno<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a> would dillute the force of this
conclusion by trying to find fault with the dispositive portion of the decision
of this Court in the Ratification Cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He contends that actually, six justices rendered opinions expressly
holding that the New Constitution has not been validly ratified in accordance
with Article XV of the 1935 Constitution and that the said dispositive, portion
"is not consistent with their findings, which were also the findings of
the majority of the Court." Otherwise stated, the position of petitioner
Diokno is that the decision in the Ratification Cases has no binding legal
force as regards the question of whether or not the New Constitution is indeed
in force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is practically
an attempt to make the Court resolve the same points which counsels for the
petitioners in the Ratification Cases submitted to the Court on the last day
for the finality of the decision therein, but without asking for either the
reconsideration or modification thereof, because they merely wanted to record
for posterity their own construction of the judgment of the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Without in any way attempting to reopen the issues already
resolved by the Court in that decision, but for the sake of erasing any doubt
as to the true import of Our judgment therein, and in order that those who
would peruse the same may not be led astray by counsel's misconstruction
thereof, the writer feels it is here opportune to say a few words relative to
petitioner's observations, considering specially that Our discussion above is
predicated on the premise that the New Constitution is in full force and
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, it is evident that the phrase in question saying
that "there is no further judicial obstacle to the New Constitution being
considered in force and effect" was in actual fact approved specifically
by the members of the Court as the juridical result of their variant separate
opinions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even those who dissented,
except Justice Zaldivar, accepted by their silence the accuracy of said
conclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
Had any of the other justices, particularly, Chief Justice Makalintal and
Justice Castro felt that their joint opinion did not justify such a judgment
they would have certainly objected to its tenor, as Justice Zaldivar did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See footnote 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, it is not for anyone to say now that
the Court misstated its judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the particular case of Counsels Tañada and Arroyo, while it is
true that on the last day for the finality of that decision, they filed a
"Constancia", separately from the Manifestation to the same effect of
the other counsel, discussing extensively the alleged inconsistency between the
collective result of the opinions of the majority of the Court and the
dispositive portion of the judgment, like the other counsel, however, they did
not make any prayer for relief, stating that their only purpose is "to
save our people from being misled and confused, in order to place things in
their proper perspective, and in order to keep faith with the 1935 Constitution
. . . so that when history passes judgment upon the real worth and meaning of
the historic Resolution of this Honorable Court promulgated on March 31, 1973,
it may have all the facts before it," for which reason, the majority of
the Court, over the dissent of Justices Zaldivar, Antonio, Esguerra and the
writer, did not consider it necessary to act, believing it was not exactly the
occasion to disabuse the minds of counsels about the judicial integrity of the
Court's actuation embodied in the resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a sense, therefore, said counsels should be deemed to be in estoppel
to raise the same points now as arguments for any affirmative relief, something
which they did not ask for when it was more appropriate to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, laying aside the division of views among the
members of the Court on the question of whether or not there has been
compliance with the provisions of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution, the
vital and decisive fact is that the majority of the Court held that the
question of whether or not the New Constitution is already in force and effect
is a political question and the Court must perforce defer to the judgment of
the political departments of the government or of the people in that
respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true some of the Justices
could not find sufficient basis for determining whether or not the people have
accepted the New Constitution, but, on that point, four Justices, Justices
Makasiar, Antonio, Esguerra and the writer, did vote categorically in the
affirmative, while two Justices, then Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice
Zaldivar, voted in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
the joint opinion of now Chief Justice Makalintal and Justice Castro, it is
crystal clear that the reference therein to their inability to accurately
appraise the people's verdict was merely casual, the thrust of their position
being that what is decisive is the President's own attitude regarding the
situation, that is, whether he would take the report of the Katipunan ng mga
Barangay to the effect that the people have approved and ratified the New
Constitution as definitive and final or he would prefer to submit the new
charter to the same kind of election which used to be held for the ratification
of constitutional amendments, his decision either way not being subject to
judicial inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently,
our distinguished colleagues were of the view that whether or not the New
Constitution may be held to have been duly ratified pursuant to Article XV of
the 1935 Constitution and even their own negative conclusion in such respect,
have no bearing on the issue of the enforceability of the New Constitution on
the basis of its having been accepted by the people, and that although they
were not possessed of sufficient knowledge to determine this particular fact,
the President's own finding thereon is conclusive upon the Court, since,
according to them, such a decision is political and outside the pale of
judicial review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote their own
words:</p>

<blockquote>"However, a finding that the ratification of the draft
Constitution by the Citizens Assemblies, as certified by the President in
Proclamation No. 1102, was not in accordance with the constitutional and
statutory procedure laid down for the purpose does not quite resolve the questions
raised in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a finding,
in our opinion, is not a matter which is essentially justiciable, that is,
within the power of this Court to inquire into.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It imports nothing more than a simple reading and application of the
pertinent provisions of the 1935 Constitution, of the Election Code and of
other related laws and official acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
question of wisdom or of policy is involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But from this finding it does not necessarily follow that this Court may
justifiably declare that the Constitution has not become effective, and for
that reason give due course to these petitions or grant the writs herein prayed
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effectivity of the Constitution
in the final analysis, is the basic and ultimate question posed by these cases,
to resolve which considerations other than judicial, and therefore beyond the
competence of this Court, are relevant and unavoidable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If indeed it be accepted that the Citizens Assemblies had
ratified the 1973 Constitution and that such ratification as well as the
establishment of the government thereunder formed part of a revolution, albeit
peaceful, then the issue of whether or not that Constitution has become
effective and, as a necessary corollary, whether or not the government
legitimately functions under it instead of under the 1935 Constitution, is
political and therefore non-judicial in nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under such a postulate what the people did in the Citizens Assemblies
should be taken as an exercise of the ultimate sovereign power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they had risen up in arms and by force
deposed the then existing government and set up a new government in its place,
there could not be the least doubt that their act would be political and not
subject to judicial review but only to the judgment of the same body politic
that is the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This concept of what
is a political act, in the context just set forth, is based on realities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a new government gains authority and
dominance through force, it can be effectively challenged only by a stronger
force; no judicial dictum can prevail against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not see that the situation would be any
different, as far as the doctrine of judicial review is concerned, if no force
had been resorted to and the people, in defiance of the existing Constitution
but peacefully because of the absence of any appreciable opposition, ordained a
new Constitution and succeeded in having the government operate under it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against such a reality there can be no
adequate judicial relief; and so courts forbear to take cognizance of the
question but leave it to be decided through political means.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But then the President, pursuant to such recommendation, did
proclaim that the Constitution had been ratified and had come into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more relevant consideration, therefore,
as far as we can see, should be as to what the President had in mind in
convening the Citizens Assemblies, submitting the Constitution to them and
proclaiming that the favorable expression of their view was an act of
ratification. In this respect subjective factors, which defy judicial analysis
and adjudication, are necessarily involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In positing the problem within an identifiable frame of
reference we find no need to consider whether or not the regime established by
President Marcos since he declared martial law and under which the new
Constitution was submitted to the Citizens Assemblies was a revolutionary
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pivotal question is rather
whether or not the effectivity of the said Constitution by virtue of
Presidential Proclamation No. 1102, upon the recommendation of the Katipunan ng
mga Barangay, was intended to be definite and irrevocable, regardless of
non-compliance with the pertinent constitutional and statutory provisions
prescribing the procedure for ratification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We must confess that after considering all the available evidence and
all the relevant circumstances we have found no reasonably reliable answer to
the question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of this seeming ambivalence, the choice of what
course of action to pursue belongs to the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have earlier made reference to subjective
factors on which this Court, to our mind, is in no position to pass
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among them is the President's
own assessment of the will of the people as expressed through the Citizens
Assemblies and of the importance of the 1973 Constitution to the successful
implementation of the social and economic reforms he has started or
envisioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he should decide that
there is no turning back, that what the people recommended through the Citizens
Assemblies, as they were reported to him, demanded that the action he took
pursuant thereto be final and irrevocable, then judicial review is out of the
question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In articulating our view that the procedure of ratification that
was followed was not in accordance with the 1935 Constitution and related
statutes, we have discharged our sworn duty as we conceive it to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President should now perhaps decide, if
he has not already decided, whether adherence to such procedure is weighty
enough a consideration, if only to dispel any cloud of doubt that may now and
in the future shroud the nation's Charter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the deliberation of this Court one of the issues
formulated for resolution is whether or not the new Constitution, since its
submission to the Citizens Assemblies, has found acceptance among the people,
such issue being related to the political question theory propounded by the
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have not tarried on the
point at all since we find no reliable basis on which to form a judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under a regime of martial law, with the free
expression of opinions through the usual media vehicles restricted, we have no
means of knowing, to the point of judicial certainty, whether the people have
accepted the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
we do not find the issue decisive insofar as our vote in these cases is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To interpret the Constitution
— that is judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
Constitution should be deemed in effect because of popular acquiescence -- that
is political, and therefore beyond the domain of judicial review." (<i>Javellana

<p class="BODY">It only remains for the writer to reiterate here a few
considerations already touched in the separate opinions in the Ratification
Cases which in his considered view may well be taken into account by those who
would read again the judgment of the Court therein.</p>

<blockquote>-1-</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having come to the conclusion that the question of whether or not
the New Constitution is legally in force and effect is political and outside
the domain of judicial review, it was not strange that the Court should simply
rule that there should be no further judicial obstacle to the enforcement of
the charter, should that be, as it appeared to be, the intent of those actually
in authority in the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
implicit in the political-question doctrine that the Court's opinion as to the
correctness of the legal postures involved is of no moment, for the simple
reason that the remedy against any error therein lies either with the sovereign
people at the polls or with the political department concerned in the discharge
of its own responsibility under the fundamental law of the land, and not with
the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it were otherwise
desirable, if only for the benefit of those interested in the settlement of the
specific legal problem posed, any categorical ruling thereon would transcend
the bounds of judicial propriety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the Court to hold it is without power to decide and in the same breath to
actually decide is an intolerable incongruity, hence any pronouncement or
holding made under the circumstances could have no more force that an <i>obiter
dictum,</i> no matter how rich in erudition and precedential support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, to say that the New
Constitution may be considered by those in authority to be in force and effect
because such is the mandate expressed by the people in the form announced by
the President is but a proper manner of expressing the Court's abstention from
wresting the power to decide from those in whom such prerogative is
constitutionally lodged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is neither
to dodge a constitutional duty nor to refrain from getting involved in a
controversy of transcendental implications — it is plain adherence to a
principle considered paramount in republican democracies wherein the
political-question doctrine is deeply imbedded as an inextricable part of the
rule of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an unpardonable
misconception of the doctrine for anyone to believe that for the Supreme Court
to bow to the perceptible or audible voice of the sovereign people in
appropriate instances is in any sense a departure from or a disregard of law as
applied to political situations, for the very rule that enjoins judicial
interference in political questions is no less a legal principle than any other
that can be conceived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, just as,
in law, judicial decisions rendered within the ambit of the courts' authority
deserve the respect of the people, by the same token, the people's verdict on
what inherently is theirs to decide must be accorded due deference by the
judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, judges would be
more powerful than the people by whom they have been given no more prerogative
than to act solely within the boundaries of the judicial sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, a court may err in finding that a
given situation calls for its abstention, in the same way it may commit
mistakes of judgment about any other matter it decides, still its decision,
conceding its honesty, cannot be faulted as an assault on the rule of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a broad sense, it may be said that
it is a necessary corollary of the truth that the administration of justice in courts
presided by human beings cannot be perfect that even the honest mistake of a
judge is a law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writer further submits that, as pointed out in his separate
opinion in the Ratification Cases, those who vehemently insist that the
referendum of January 10-15, 1973 was not the kind of election contemplated in
Article XV of the 1935 Constitution seem to overlook that the said provision
refers only to the mode of ratifying amendments thereto and makes no mention at
all of how a new constitution designed to supersede it is to be submitted for
approval by the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
writer would readily agree, as was already made clear in the aforementioned
opinion, that if what were submitted to the people in the January, 1973
referendum had been merely an amendment or a bundle of amendments to the 1935
Constitution, the results thereof could not constitute a valid ratification
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since it was a whole
integral charter that the Citizens' Assemblies had before them in that
referendum, it is evident that the ratification clause invoked cannot be
controlling.</p>

<p class="BODY">That a new constitution is not contemplated is indicated in the
text of the provision itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Such amendments shall be
valid as part of this Constitution when approved by a majority of the votes
cast . . . .” How can it be ever conceived that the 1973 Constitution which is
an entire charter in itself, differing substantially in its entirety and
radically in most of its provisions, from the 1935 Constitution be part of the
latter?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the mode of
ratification prescribed in Article XV is only for amendments that can be made
part of the whole constitution, obviously not to an entire charter precisely
purported to supersede it.</p>

<p class="BODY">And it is but logical that a constitution cannot and should not
attempt to bind future generations as to how they would do away with it in
favor of one suitable to their more recent needs and aspirations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in <i>Tolentino vs. Comelec</i>,
41 SCRA 702, this Court, thru the writer, held that:</p>

<blockquote>"In our discussion of the issue of jurisdiction, We have
already made it clear that the Convention came into being by a call of a joint
session of Congress pursuant to Section 1 of Article XV of the Constitution,
already quoted earlier in this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We reiterate also that as to matters not related to its internal
operation and the performance of its assigned mission to propose amendments to
the Constitution, the Convention and its officers and members are all subject
to all the provisions of the existing Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, We hold that even as to its latter task
of proposing amendments to the Constitution, it is subject to the provisions of
Section 1 of Article XV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be
so, because it is plain to Us that the framers of the Constitution took care
that the process of amending the same should not be undertaken with the same
ease and facility in changing an ordinary legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constitution making is the most valued power,
second to none, of the people in a constitutional democracy such as the one our
founding fathers have chosen for this nation, and which we of the succeeding
generations generally cherish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
because the Constitution affects the lives, fortunes, future and every other
conceivable aspect of the lives of all the people within the country and those
subject to its sovereignty, every degree of care is taken in preparing and
drafting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A constitution worthy of
the people for which it is intended must not be prepared in haste without
adequate deliberation and study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obvious that correspondingly, any amendment of the Constitution itself, must
perforce be conceived and prepared with as much care and deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the very nature of things, the drafters
of an original constitution, as already observed earlier, operate without any
limitations, restraints or inhibitions save those that they may impose upon
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not necessarily true
of subsequent conventions called to amend the original constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, the framers of the latter see to
it that their handiwork is not lightly treated and as easily mutilated or
changed, not only for reasons purely personal but more importantly, because
written constitutions are supposed to be designed so as to last for some time,
if not for ages, or for, at least, so long as they can be adopted to the needs
and exigencies of the people, hence, they must be insulated against precipitate
and hasty actions motivated by more or less passing political moods or
fancies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as a rule, the original
constitutions carry with them limitations and conditions, more or less
stringent, made so by the people themselves, in regard to the process of their
amendment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when such limitations or
conditions are so incorporated in the original constitution, it does not lie in
the delegates of any subsequent convention to claim that they may ignore and
disregard such conditions because they are as powerful and omnipotent as their
original counterparts." (At Page 724-726)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But this passage should not be
understood, as it was not meant to be understood, to refer to the people's
inalienable right to cast aside the whole constitution itself when they find it
to be in their best interests to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was so indicated already in the resolution denying the motion for
reconsideration:</p>

<blockquote>"This is not to say that the people may not, in the exercise
of their inherent revolutionary powers, amend the Constitution or promulgate an
entirely new one otherwise, but as long as any amendment is formulated and
submitted under the aegis of the present Charter, any proposal for such
amendment which is not in conformity with the letter, spirit and intent of the
provision of the Charter for effecting amendments cannot receive the sanction
of this Court." (Resolution of Motion for Reconsideration, <i>Tolentino vs.
Comelec</i>, G.R. No. L-34150, <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1971</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">For it is rather absurd to think that in
approving a new fundamental law with which they would replace the existing one,
they have to adhere to the mandates of the latter, under pain of getting stuck
with it, should they fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One can
easily visualize how the evil forces which dominated the electoral process
during the old society would have gone into play in order to stifle the urge
for change, had the mode of ratification in the manner of past plebiscites been
the one observed in the submission of the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reiterate what the writer said in the
Ratification Cases:</p>

<blockquote>"Consider that in the present case
what is involved is not just an amendment of a particular provision of an
existing Constitution; here, it is, as I have discussed earlier above, an
entirely new Constitution that is being proposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This important circumstance makes a great
deal of difference.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No less than counsel Tolentino for herein
respondents Puyat and Roy, who was himself the petitioner in the case I have
just referred to, is now inviting Our attention to the exact language of
Article XV and suggesting that the said Article may be strictly applied to
proposed amendments but may hardly govern the ratification of a new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is particularly
stressed that the Article specifically refers to nothing else but
"amendments to this Constitution" which if ratified "shall be
valid as part of this Constitution." Indeed, how can a whole new
constitution be by any manner of reasoning an amendment to any other
constitution and how can it, if ratified, form part of such other constitution?
x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is not strange at all to think that the amending clause of
a constitution should be confined in its application only to proposed changes
in any part of the same constitution itself, for the very fact that a new
constitution is being adopted implies a general intent to put aside the whole
of the old one, and what would be really incongruous is the idea that in such
an eventuality, the new Constitution would subject its going into effect to any
provision of the constitution it is to supersede, to use the language precisely
of Section 6, Article XVII, the effectivity clause, of the New
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My understanding is that
generally, constitutions are selfborn, they very rarely, if at all, come into
being, by virtue of any provision of another constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be the reason why every
constitution has its own effectivity clause, so that if, the Constitutional
Convention had only anticipated the idea of the referendum and provided for
such a method to be used in the ratification of the New Constitution, I would
have had serious doubts as to whether Article XV could have had priority of
application." (<i>Javellana vs. The Executive Secretary</i> — 50 SCRA 197-198).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since in the withdrawal motion of petitioner Diokno, the whole
thrust of this posture relative to the alleged non-enforceability of the
Constitution of 1973 revolves around supposed non-compliance in its
ratification, with Article XV of the 1935 Charter, and inasmuch as it is
evident that the letter and intent of that invoked provision do not warrant, as
has just been explained, the application thereof to the New Constitution, for
the simple reason that the same is not in fact and in law as well as in form
and in intent a mere amendment to the Old Constitution, but an integrally new
charter which cannot conceivably be made just a part thereof, one cannot but
view said motion to withdraw as having been designed for no other purpose than
to serve as a vehicle for the ventilation of petitioner's political rather than
legal outlook which deserves scant consideration in the determination of the
merits of the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, that a constitution need not be ratified in the
manner prescribed by its predecessor and that the possible invalidity or the
mode of its ratification does not affect its enforceability, as long as the
fact of its approval by the people or their acquiescence thereto is reasonably
shown, is amply demonstrated in the scholarly dissertation made by our learned
colleague, Mr. Justice Felix V. Makasiar, in his separate opinion in the
Ratification Cases, which carried the concurrence of Justices Antonio, Esguerra
and the writer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that what took place
in the Philippines in January, 1973 is not an unprecedented practice peculiar
to our country, is likewise plainly shown therein, since it appears that no
less than the Constitution of the United States of America, the nation whose
close adherence to constitutionalism petitioners would want the Filipinos to
emulate, was also ratified in a way not in conformity with the Articles of
Confederation and Perpetual Union, the Constitution which it replaced, and the
reason for it was only because those in authority felt that it was impossible to
secure ratification, if the amendment clause of the Articles were to be
observed, and so they resorted to extra-constitutional means to accomplish
their purpose of having a new constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Following is the pertinent portion of Mr. Justice Makasiar's illuminating
disquisition based on actual historical facts rather than on theoretical and
philosophical hypotheses on which petitioners would seem to rely:</p>

<blockquote>"The classic example of an illegal submission that did not
impair the validity of the ratification or adoption of a new Constitution is
the case of the Federal Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be recalled that the thirteen (13) original states of the
American Union — which succeeded in liberating themselves from England after
the revolution which began on April 19, 1775 with the skirmish at Lexington,
Massachusetts and ended with the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown,
Virginia, on October 19, 1781 (Encyclopedia Brit., Vol. 1, 1933 Ed., p. 776) —
adopted their Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, that was written
from 1776 to 1777 and ratified on March 1, 1781 (Encyclopedia Brit., Vol. II,
1966 Ed., p. 525).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About six years
thereafter, the Congress of the Confederation passed a resolution on <st1:date year="1787" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1787</st1:date> calling for a Federal
Constitutional Convention <i>"for the sole and express purpose of revising
the articles of confederation . . ." </i>(Appendix I, The Federalist,
Modern Library ed., p. 577, italics supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Convention convened at <st1:city><st1:place>Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1787" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1787</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union stated specifically:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">‘The articles of this confederation shall
be inviolably observed by every state, and the union shall be perpetual; nor <i>shall
any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such
alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states, and be afterwards
confirmed by the legislatures of every state</i>.’ (See the Federalist,
Appendix II, Modern Library Ed., 1937, p. 584; italics supplied).</p>

<blockquote>But the foregoing requirements prescribed by the Articles of
Confederation and Perpetual Union for the alteration and for the ratification
of the Federal Constitution as drafted by the Philadelphia Convention were not
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fearful that the said Federal
Constitution would not be ratified by the state legislatures as prescribed, the
Philadelphia Convention adopted a resolution requesting the Congress of the
Confederation to pass a resolution providing that the Federal Constitution
should be submitted to elected state conventions and if ratified by the
conventions in nine (9) states, not necessarily in all thirteen (13) states,
the said Constitution shall take effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, history Professor Edward Earle Mead of <st1:place><st1:placename>Princeton</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> recorded that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It would have been a counsel of perfection to consign the new
Constitution to the tender mercies of the legislatures of each and all of the
13 states.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience clearly indicated
that ratification would have had the same chance as the scriptural camel
passing thru the eye of a needle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>It
was therefore determined to recommend to Congress that the new Constitution be
submitted to conventions in the several states specially elected to pass it and
when it should be ratified by nine of the thirteen states . . .’ </i>(The
Federalist, Modern Library Ed., 1937, Introduction by Edward Earle Mead, pp.
viii-ix, italics supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Historian Samuel Eliot Morison similarly recounted:</p>

<p class="2Q">'The Convention, anticipating that the influence of many state
politicians would be Antifederalist, provided for ratification of the
Constitution by popularly elected conventions in each state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suspecting that <st1:state><st1:place>Rhode
  Island</st1:place></st1:state>, at least, would prove recalcitrant, it
declared that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states
ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The convention method had the
further advantage that judges, ministers, and others ineligible to state
legislatures, could be elected to a convention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nine-state provision was, of course, mildly revolutionary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Congress of the Confederation, still
sitting in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> to carry on
federal government until relieved, formally submitted the new constitution to
the states and politely faded out before the first presidential inauguration.'
(The <st1:city><st1:place>Oxford</st1:place></st1:city> History of the Am.
People by Samuel Eliot Morison, 1965 ed., p. 312).</p>

<blockquote>And so the American Constitution was ratified by nine (9) states on
June 21, 1788 and by the last four states on May 29, 1790 (12 C.J. p. 679
footnote, 16 C.J.S. 27 — by the state conventions and not by all thirteen (13
state legislatures as required by Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union aforequoted — and in spite of the fact that the Federal
Constitution as originally adopted suffers from <i>two basic infirmities,
namely, the absence of a bill of rights and of a provision affirming the power
of judicial review.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>The liberties of the American people were guaranteed by the
subsequent amendments to the Federal Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of judicial review has become
part of American constitutional law only by virtue of a judicial pronouncement
by Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Marbury <i>vs. </i>Madison (1803, 1
Cranch 137).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Until this date, no challenge has been launched against the

<p class="2Q">'Pomeroy's Constitutional Law, p. 55, discussing the convention
that formulated the constitution of the United States, has this to say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The convention proceeded to do, and did
accomplish, what they were not authorized to do by a resolution of Congress
that called them together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
resolution plainly contemplated amendments to the articles of confederation, to
be submitted to and passed by the Congress, and afterwards ratified by all the
state legislatures, in the manner pointed out by the existing organic law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the convention soon became convinced that
any amendments were powerless to effect a cure; that the disease was too deeply
seated to be reached by such tentative means.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They saw that the system they were called to improve must be totally
abandoned, and that the national idea must be re-established at the center of
their political society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was objected
by some members, that they had no power, no authority, to construct a new
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had no authority, if
their decisions were to be final; and no authority whatever, under the articles
of confederation, to adopt the course they did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But they knew that their labors were only to be suggestions: and that
they as well as any private individuals, and any private individuals as well as
they, had a right to propose a plan of government to the people for their
adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were, in fact, a mere
assemblage of private citizens, and their work had no more binding sanction,
than a constitution drafted by Mr. Hamilton in his office would have had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people, by their expressed will,
transformed this suggestion, this proposal, into an organic law, and the people
might have done the same with a constitution submitted to them by a single citizen.'</p>

<blockquote>Against the decision in the Wheeler case, supra, confirming the
validity of the ratification and adoption of the American Constitution, in
spite of the fact that such ratification was a clear violation of the
prescription on alteration and ratification of the Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union, petitioners in G.R. No. L-36165 dismissed this most
significant historical fact by calling the Federal Constitution of the United
States as a revolutionary one, invoking the opinion expressed in Vol. 16,
Corpus Juris Secundum, p. 27, that it was a revolutionary constitution because
it did not obey the requirement that the Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union can be amended only with the consent of all thirteen (13) state
legislatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opinion does not cite
any decided case, but merely refers of the footnotes on the brief historical
account of the United States Constitution on p. 679 of Vol. 12, CJS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, on p. 18 of their main Notes,
refer US to pp. 270-316 of the <i>Oxford History of the American People, </i>1965
Ed. by Samuel Eliot Morison, who discusses the Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union in Chapter XVIII captioned `Revolutionary Constitution Making,
1775 1781' (pp. 270-281).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Chapter XX
on 'The Creative Period in Politics, 1785-1788,' Professor Morison delineates
the genesis of the Federal Constitution, but does not refer to it even
implicitly as a revolutionary constitution (pp. 297-316).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Federal Constitution may be
considered revolutionary from the view point of McIver if the term <i>revolution
</i>is understood in 'its WIDER sense to embrace decisive changes in the
character of<i> </i>government, even though they do not involve the violent
overthrow of an established order, xx.' (R.M. Maclver, The Web of Government,
1965 ed., p. 203).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is rather ridiculous to refer to the American Constitution as a

Federal Constitution of the United States which was adopted seven (7) or nine (9)
years after the thirteen (13) states won their independence and long after

that no further refutation is needed." <i>(50 SCRA 209-215).<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, whether a proposal submitted to the people is just an
amendment to an existing constitution within the contemplation of its amendment
clause or is a new charter not comprehended by its language may not be
determined solely by the simple processes of analysis of and comparison between
the contents of one and the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very
much depends on what the constituent assembly, reflecting its understanding of
the desire of the people it represents, actually intends its handiwork to be,
as such intent may be duduced from the face of the document itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the truth is that whatever changes in
form and in substance a constitution may undergo, as long as the same
political, social and economic ideologies as before continue to be the
motivation behind such changes, the result can never be, in a strict sense, a
new constitution at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in such
circumstance, any alteration or modification of any provision of a
constitution, no matter how extensive, can always be traced as founded on its
own bedrock, thereby proving identity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is therefore the expressed desire of the makers of the charter that
is decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that is why the New
Constitution has its own effectivity clause which makes no reference howsoever
to Article XV of the past charter.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, how the founding fathers of America must have regarded the
difference between a constitutional amendment, on the one hand, and a new
Constitution, on the other, when they found the Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union no longer adequate for the full development of their nation, as
can be deduced from the historical account above, is at least one case in point
— they exercised their right to ratify their new fundamental law in the most
feasible manner, without regard to any constitutional constraints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, it is the constitution that is reputed
to have stood all tests and was, in fact, the model of many national
constitutions, including our own of 1935, if it cannot be accurately regarded
also as the model of the present one.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing considerations in mind, it can be readily seen
how pointless it is to contend, as petitioner Diokno does in his motion to
withdraw, that what he deems as the failure of the January, 1973 referendum to
conform with the requirements of Article XV of the 1935 Constitution detracts
from the enforceability of the New Constitution, in the light of the
President's assertion contained in Proclamation 1102 that it has been approved
and ratified by the people, coupled with his evident firm and irreversible
resolution to consider it to have been, indeed, duly ratified, and in the face
of the indisputable fact that the whole government effectively in control of
the entire Philippine territory has been operating under it without any visible
resistance on the part any significant sector of the populace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allude to the filing of the petitions in
the Plebiscite and the Ratification Cases and the occasional appearances in
some public places of some underground propaganda which, anyway, has not cut
any perceptible impression anywhere, as indicative or evidence of opposition by
the people to the New Constitution would be, to use a commonplace but apt
expression, to mistake the trees for the forest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus abundantly clear that the passionate and tenacious ratiocination
in petitioner Diokno's withdrawal motion tending to assail the cogency of our
opinions and their consistency with the judgment in the Ratification Cases, to
the extent of using terms that could signify doubt in the good faith and
intellectual integrity of some members of the Court and of trying to embarrass
the Court itself before the bar of history, does not in fact have any plausible
basis whatsoever.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">C O N C L U S I O N</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant cases are unique.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To Our knowledge never before has any national tribunal of the highest
authority been called upon to pass on the validity of a martial law order of
the Executive issued in the face of actual or imminent danger of a rebellion —
threatening the very existence of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitions herein treat of no more than the deprivation of liberty of
the petitioners, but in reality what is involved here is the legitimacy of the
government itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No Supreme Court of
any other country in the world, We reiterate, has even been confronted with
such a transcendental issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is, therefore, a decision that affects not the petitioners
alone, but the whole country and all our people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, We have endeavored to the
best of our ability to look at all the issues from every conceivable point of
view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have gone over all the
jurisprudence cited by the parties, the writings of learned and knowledgeable
authorities they have quoted and whatever We could avail of by Ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We trust We have not misunderstood any of the
contentions of the parties and their able and learned counsels and that We have
not overlooked any authority relevant to them. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And We must say We perceive no cause to
downgrade their love of and loyalty to our common motherland even if
differences there are between our convictions as to how to earlier attain the
national destiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, We have not
considered as really persuasive any insinuations of motivations born of
political partisanship and personal ambitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not mean to belittle or depreciate foreign jurisprudence,
but We have deliberately refrained from relying on alien opinions, judicial or
otherwise, in order to stress that the Filipinos can solve their own problems
with their own resources intellectual or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, We doubt if there is enough relevant
parallelism between occurrences in other countries passed upon by the courts
with what is happening here today.</p>

<p class="BODY">Principally, by this decision, We hold that the power to proclaim
martial law is lodged by the Constitution exclusively in the Executive, but the
grant of judicial power to the Supreme Court also by the Constitution is
plenary and total and, therefore, when it is a matter of judicial notice,
because it is commonly known by the general public or is capable of
unquestionable demonstration, that any particular declaration of martial law is
devoid of any of the constitutionally required bases, the Court has the full
authority and it would not hesitate to strike down any such improvident
proclamation and to adjudge that the legitimate government continue without the
offending Executive, who shall be replaced in accordance with the rules of
succession provided in the existing Constitution and laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases at bar, however, the Court, with
the abstention of only one member who has preferred not to emit any opinion on
the issue at this time, holds that the President had good and sufficient
grounds in issuing Proclamation 1081, whether the same is examined in the light
of its own recitals, as some Justices advocate, or of facts of judicial notice
together with those undisputed in the record, in the manner the rest of Us have
actually tested it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We further hold that
in restraining the liberties of petitioners, the President has not overstepped
the boundaries fixed by the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">For doctrinal purposes, it is best to add to all the foregoing
that a judicial challenge against the imposition of martial law by the
Executive in the midst of the actualities of a real assault against the
territorial integrity and life of the nation, inevitably calls for the
reconciliation, which We feel We have been able to effectuate here, of two
extremes in the allocation of powers under the Constitution — the resort by the
Executive to the ultimate weapon with which the fundamental law allows him to
defend the state against factual invasion or rebellion threatening the public
safety, on the one hand, and the assertion by the Supreme Court of the
irreducible plenitude of its judicial authority, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other conflict of prerogatives of such
total dimensions can conceivably arise from the operation of any other two
parts of the charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision then
could well be <i>sui</i> <i>generis, </i>hence, whatever has been said here
would not necessarily govern questions related to adverse claims of authority
related to the lower levels of the hierarchy of powers in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We humbly submit this decision to the judgment of all our people,
to history and to the generations of Filipinos still unborn, confident that it
carries all that We know and all that We are.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As We do this, We are fully aware that in this critical stage of our life
as a nation, our overriding need is unity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is Our fervent hope that by this decision, We have duly performed Our
constitutionally assigned part in the great effort to reduce if not to
eliminate the remaining fundamental causes of internecine strife.</p>

<p class="BODY">May Divine Providence continue to always keep the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">J U D G M E N T</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions in all the above-entitled cases
are dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">A D D E N D U M</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are my reasons for voting in favor of granting the
motion to withdraw:</p>

<p class="BODY">It is elementary that the remedy of <i>habeas corpus </i>exists
only against involuntary confinement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The moment, therefore, that after initially questioning the legality of
his detention, the petitioner seeks withdrawal of his petition at any stage of
the case before judgment, his detention becomes in law automatically, by his
own act, voluntary or with his express consent, hence, the reason for further
inquiry into the circumstances thereof ceases completely, and the court's duty
to proceed further and render judgment comes to an end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By allowing the withdrawal, no interest of
justice would be prejudiced, no juridical harm needing redress could be caused
to anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the petitioner's
motive for his withdrawal, whether expressed or unarticulated, are absolutely
immaterial, albeit, in the case at bar, petitioner himself suggests that, while
acceding to his request, the members of the Court may express their views
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sur-Rejoinder dated May 21,
1974, p. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the mind of the writer, the grounds alleged by petitioner
Diokno and his counsel have an apparent tendency to offend the dignity of the
Court and to undermine the respect and faith of the people in its capacity to
administer justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse, they
may be false and baseless, as they are emotional and personal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless properly explained, they give the
impression that movant is impeaching the integrity and good faith of some
members of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the premises,
said petitioner and counsel could be required to show cause why they should not
be held in contempt of the Court, but there being no formal charge to such
effect in the instant proceedings, and in order not to confuse the discussion
and resolution of the transcendental issues herein, it is preferable, and the
Court has opted, to take up the matter of the possible responsibility for
contempt separately, either <i>motu propio </i>or upon the initiative of
whoever may allege to be aggrieved thereby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the present, it has to be stated, however, that under no circumstances
may any party or counsel vent his personal feelings and emotions in any
pleading or paper filed with the Court, particularly while his case is pending
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Personalities that are directed
towards the occupants of the judicial office naturally mar the legal issues
before them, correspondingly making more difficult their proper and impartial
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the judges concerned
are actually, as they are supposed to be, unmoved by them, still there can be
no assurance that the litigants and the public in general will be convinced of
their absolute impartiality in their subsequent actuations, and to that extent,
the interests of justice are bound to suffer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is but in keeping with the highest traditions of the judiciary that
such improprieties are not allowed to pass unnoticed and are dealt with by the
court either <i>motu propio </i>or upon corresponding complaint, whether in and
independent proceeding or as an incident within the pending case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No court worthy of its position should
tolerate them.</p>

<p class="BODY">But assaults upon the dignity and integrity of the court, are one
thing, and the issues of the case at hand are another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of what the judge thinks is the
belief of those concerned about the motivations of the court's subsequent
resolution of the issues, unless he inhibits himself from further acting in the
case, circumstances permitting, it is his inescapable duty to render judgment,
taking care, of course, that he remains, in fact, objective and impartial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, of no moment, for the
purposes of disposing of petitioner Diokno's motion to withdraw, whether or not
the charges leveled by him and his counsel against the Court or any of its
members are founded or unfounded and whether or not the same constitute
actionable misconduct on their part, as participants in the case before Us
and/or as members of the Bar and officers of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any possible action for such probable
misconduct has no bearing on the question of whether or not, observing the
usual rules and practices, the Court should dismiss his main petition, the
alleged illegality of his detention having been duly cured by his voluntary
submission thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these is not to say that I have not given thought to the
imperative necessity of resolving the issues of public interest raised in
petitioner Diokno's petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can also
see that it is important to the Government that he does not escape the legal
effect of the decision in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if these are the main reasons for denying his motion to withdraw, I
believe that the Government's apprehensions are rather unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I would not say that by his withdrawal,
petitioner impliedly admits the correctness of the stand of the Government,
what with the avalanche of protests against alleged injustice and supposed
legal errors running through his pleadings, I am of the considered view that in
law, he cannot correctly pretend that the rulings of the Court in the other
cases herein in respect to the issues therein that are common with those of his
petition are not binding on him at least by precedential force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And inasmuch as in the cases not withdrawn,
all the issues of public interest raised in his case will have to be resolved,
I do not see any purpose in insisting that he should remain a petitioner when
he refuses, as a matter of conscience, to await the unfavorable verdict he
foresees in his own case, which he himself anticipates will not set him free
anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, he protests that
nothing he can say can convince the Court, and, on the other hand, perhaps, the
most technically accurate and palpably just decision the court may fashion will
not convince him, but it has to be a strange court that will yield to a
litigant's point of view just because he sincerely feels he is right, whereas
it is not unusual for a litigant to pretend not to see the correctness and
justice of the court's judgment unfavorable to his interests.</p>

The writer's reasons in favor of granting the motion to withdraw are discussed in
the addendum to this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
Court as a body has denied said motion, petitioner Diokno's case has to be
resolved on its merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, a
discussion of some of the grounds alleged in the said motion which may have a
bearing in one way of another with the fundamental issues herein involved is in
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view, however, of the release
of Senator Diokno on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11 1974</st1:date>,
the Court has decided to dismiss his petition for being moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this development does not necessarily
render the discussion of his contentions irrelevant because they can also
support the cases of the other petitioner, hence it seems better to retain said
discussion in this opinion.</p>

case of Sergio Osmena, Jr. <i>vs</i>. Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Presidential
Electoral Tribunal upheld the election of President Marcos in November, 1969
and dismissed the protest of Osmena, ruling as follows:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">“In the light of the foregoing, We
are of the opinion and so hold that the result of the revision and appreciation
of the ballots in the pilot provinces, congressional districts and cities
designated by the Protestant as best exemplifying the rampant terrorism and
massive vote-buying, as well as the fraud and other irregularities allegedly
committed by the Protestee, has shown, beyond doubt, that the latter had
obtained <i>a very substantial plurality and/or majority of votes</i> over the
former, regardless of whether We consider that the Protest is limited to the
elections in the provinces, congressional districts and cities specified in
paragraph VIII of the Protest, or includes, also, the result of the elections
in the provinces and municipalities mentioned in paragraph VII of the Protest,
or even if the average reductions suffered by both parties in said pilot
provinces, congressional districts and cities were applied to the entire
Philippines; that it is unnecessary, therefore, to continue the present
proceedings and revise the ballots cast in the provinces and cities specified
in paragraph VIII of the Protest — much less those named in paragraph VII
thereof —other than the pilot provinces and congressional districts designated
by the Protestant, as above-stated; that neither would it serve any useful
purpose to revise the ballots cast in the provinces and cities
counter-protested by the Protestee herein; that, in filing his certificate of
candidacy - for Mayor of Cebu City, in the general elections held in 1971, and
particularly, in assuming said office on January 1, 1972, (as attested to by
his oath of office, copy of which is appended to this decision as Annex H)
after his proclamation as the candidate elected to said office, the Protestant
had abandoned his Protest herein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the
Protestant has failed to make out his case; that the Protestee has obtained the
plurality and majority of the votes cast for the office of the President of the
Philippines, in the general elections held in 1969; and that, accordingly, he
was duly elected to said office in the aforementioned elections and properly
proclaimed as such.”</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref19" name="_ftn19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> In the referendum of <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="1">January 10-15, 1973</st1:date>, the people expressed themselves
against the holding of elections and the immediate convening of the

 27-28, 1973</st1:date>.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a> It is interesting to note that the other
petitioners have not discussed this issue and do not seemingly join him in his
pose.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref21" name="_ftn21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> Which may not be surprising, considering that
Counsel Tañada of petitioner Diokno who signed the motion to withdraw was one
of the leading counsels of the petitioners in the Ratification Cases.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref22" name="_ftn22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a> In G.R. No. L-36142, Javellana <i>vs</i>. Executive
Secretary and the other Ratification Cases, the writer, joined by Justices
Antonio and Esguerra, was of the view that before allowing the entry of final
judgment and despite the absence of any prayer for relief in the Constancia and
Manifestation mentioned above, it was best for the Court to correct the
representation of counsel regarding the true juridical import of the decision,
but the majority were of the opinion that misconstructions by the interested
parties of the judgment of the Court cannot alter the effect thereof intended
by the Court and evident in its dispositive portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writer was afraid that future occasions
might arise, as it has happened now, when Our silence may be taken advantage
of, even for the sake of propaganda alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, Justice Zaldivar stated that "I find merit in
the 'Constancia' and manifestation of counsel for the petitioners where they
assert that the sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'This being
the vote of the majority, there is no further judicial obstacle to the New
Constitution being considered in force and effect in the dispositive portion of
the resolution is not warranted . . ." and that "This last sentence
of the dispositive portion of the resolution should have been deleted."</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a> The above exposition of the joint opinion is made
in order to explain why the rest of the members of the Court (except Justice
Zaldivar) evidently felt that the view thus expressed by Chief Justice
Makalintal and Justice Castro justified not only the judgment of dismissal but
also the statement that "there is no more judicial obstacle to the New
Constitution being considered in force and effect."</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref24" name="_ftn24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a> Section 16 of Article XVII of the 1973 Constitution
provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This Constitution shall
take effect immediately upon its ratification by a majority of the votes cast
in a plebiscite called for the purpose and, except as herein provided, shall
supersede the Constitution of nineteen hundred and thirty-five and all
amendments thereto." Even this expressed desire of the Convention was
disregarded by the people, and it is difficult to see what valid principle
there is that can curtail them from exercising their ultimate sovereign
authority in the manner they deem best under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">These nine cases are applications for writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitions aver in substance that on
September 21, 1972 the President of the Philippines placed the country under
martial law (Proclamation 1081); that on various dates from September 22 to
September 30, 1972, the petitioners or the persons in whose behalf the
applications were made were arrested by the military authorities and detained,
some at Fort <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, others at Camp <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
and still others at Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, both in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; and that the arrest and detention of the
petitioners were illegal, having been effected without a valid order of a
competent court of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> were issued by the Court directing
the respondents Secretary of National Defense, Chief of Staff of the Armed
Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, to produce the bodies of the
petitioners in Court on designated dates and to make returns to the writs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time the respondents, through the
Solicitor General, filed their returns to the writs and answers to the
petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admitting that the
petitioners had been arrested and detained, the respondents nevertheless
justified such arrest and detention as having been legally ordered by the
President of the Philippines pursuant to his proclamation of martial law, the
petitioners being regarded as participants or as having given aid and comfort
"in the conspiracy to seize political and state power and to take over the
government by force." The respondents traversed the petitioners'
contention that their arrest and detention were unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hearings were held on September 26 and 29 and <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1972</st1:date>, at which the
petitioners were produced in Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter the parties filed memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, some of the petitioners, with leave of Court, withdrew
their petitions;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
others, without doing so, were subsequently released from custody under certain
restrictive conditions.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Enrique Voltaire Garcia II, the sole petitioner in L-35547 and one of those
released, having died shortly after his release, the action was deemed abated
as to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As of this date only Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, in
whose behalf the petition in L-35539 was filed, and <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. in L-35546, are still in military
custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 23, 1973 the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
filed an action for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with this Court, alleging
that on August 11, 1973 charges of murder, subversion and illegal possession of
firearms were filed against him with a military commission; that his trial by
the military court which was to be held on August 27, 29 and 31, 1973 was
illegal because the proclamation of martial law was unconstitutional; and that
he could not expect a fair trial because the President of the Philippines,
having prejudged his case, could reverse any judgment of acquittal by the
military court and sentence him to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That <span class="GramE">action,</span> docketed as L-37364 and entitled
"<span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
Jr. vs. Military Commission No. 2," is still pending consideration and
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, on
December 28, 1973, filed a motion to withdraw the petition filed in his behalf,
imputing delay in the disposition of his case, and asseverating that because of
the decision of the Court in the Ratification Cases<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and the action of the members of the Court<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
in taking an oath to support the new Constitution, he cannot "reasonably
expect to get justice in this case." The respondents oppose the motion on
the grounds that there is a public interest in the decision of these cases and
that the reasons given for the motion to withdraw are untrue, unfair and
contemptuous.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The threshold question is whether to allow the withdrawal of the
petition in L-35539 filed in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his letter to his counsel, which is the
basis of the motion to withdraw, <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> states the
following considerations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>first</i>,
the delay in the disposition of his case; <i>second</i>, the dismissal of the
petitions in the Ratification Cases, contrary to the Court's ruling that the
1973 Constitution was not validly ratified; and <i>third</i>, the action of the
members of the Court in taking an oath of allegiance to the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
asserts that "a conscience that allows a man to rot behind bars for more
than one year and three months without trial — of course, without any charges
at all — is a conscience that has become stunted, if not stultified," and
that "in swearing to support the new 'Constitution,' the five members of
the Court who had held that it had not been validly ratified, have not
fulfilled our expectations." He goes on to say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I do not blame them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not know what I would have done in their
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, at the same time, I can not
continue to entrust my case to them; and I have become thoroughly convinced
that our quest for justice in my case is futile."</p>

<p class="BODY">As already noted, the Solicitor General, in behalf of the
respondents, opposes the withdrawal of the petition on the ground of public
interest, adding that the motion to withdraw cannot be granted by the Court
without in effect admitting the "unfair, untrue and contemptuous"
statements contained therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without passing on the liability of any party in this case for
contemptuous statements made, the Court (by a vote of 5 to 7) denied the
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">I voted for the denial of the motion to withdraw for inescapable
reasons that I now proceed to expound.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that in the absence of a statute expressly or
impliedly prohibiting the withdrawal of an action, the party bringing such
action may dismiss it even without the consent of the defendant or respondent
where the latter will not be prejudiced, although it may be necessary to obtain
leave of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there are recognized
exceptions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when the <i>public interest
or questions of public importance</i> are involved.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
For example, the fact that a final determination of a question involved in an
action is needed or will be useful as a guide for the conduct of public
officers or tribunals is a sufficient reason for retaining an action which
would or should otherwise be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, appeals may be retained if the questions involved are likely
to arise frequently in the future unless they are settled by a court of last
resort.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <i>Gonzales vs. Commission on Elections</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
an action for declaratory judgment impugning the validity of Republic Act No.
4880 which prohibits the early nomination of candidates for elective offices
and early election campaigns or partisan political activities became moot by
reason of the holding of the 1967 elections before decision could be
rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless the Court treated
the petition as one for prohibition and rendered judgment in view of "the
paramount public interest and the undeniable necessity for a ruling, the
national elections [of 1969] being barely six months away."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Krivenko</i></span><i> vs. Register of
Deeds</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court denied the petition to withdraw an appeal in view of the public
importance of the questions involved, and lest "the constitutional mandate
[proscribing the sale of lands to aliens] . . . be ignored or misconceived,
with all the harmful consequences . . . upon the national economy."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> has made
allegations to the effect that the President has "arrogated" unto
himself the powers of government by "usurping" the powers of Congress
and "ousting" the courts of their jurisdiction, thus establishing in
this country a "virtual dictatorship." <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
and his counsel have in fact stressed that the present trend of events in this
country since the proclamation of martial law bears a resemblance to the trend
of events that led to the establishment of a dictatorship in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under Hitler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus a profound
public interest in the resolution of the questions raised in the cases at bar,
questions that, in the phrase of Chief Justice Marshall in <span class="SpellE"><i>Marbury</i></span><i>
vs. Madison</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
are "deeply interesting to the nation." I apprehend that in view of
the import of the allegations made by <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> and his
counsel, incalculable harm or, in the very least, great disservice may be
caused to the national interest if these cases are not decided on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General has
observed, "petitioner's [<span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span>] arrest and
detention have been so exploited in the hate campaign that the only way to
protect the integrity of the government is to insist on a decision of this case
in the forum in which the petitioner had chosen to bring them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, like festering sores, the issues
stirred up by this litigation will continue to agitate the nation."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the policy considerations
just discussed, I am gladdened that the Court has not shunted aside what I
regard as the inescapable moral constraints in the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> motion to withdraw his petition for <i>habeas
corpus</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court repudiated the facile recourse of avoiding resolution of the issues
on the pretext that <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> insists on withdrawing his
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus not a mere
happenstance that, notwithstanding that seven members of the Court are of the
view that <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> has an absolute right to withdraw
his petition, the Court has confronted the issues posed by him, and now
resolves them squarely, definitively and courageously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No respectable legal historian or responsible
chronicler of the nation's destiny will therefore have any reason to level the
indictment that once upon a grave national crisis the Court abdicated its
constitutional prerogative of adjudication and forswore the sacred trust
reposed in it as the nation's ultimate arbiter on transcendental, far-reaching <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> questions.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the reasons given for the motion to withdraw, the
Court is mindful that it has taken some time to resolve these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In explanation let it be said that the issues
presented for resolution in these cases are of the utmost gravity and
delicateness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No question of the awesome
magnitude of those here presented has ever confronted the Court in all its
history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not aware that any other
court, except possibly the Circuit Court in <i>Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i>
<span class="SpellE"><i>Merryman</i></span><i>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
has decided like questions during the period of the emergency that called for
the proclamation of martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then in <span class="SpellE"><i>Merryman</i></span> the Court
there held that under the U.S. Federal Constitution the President did not have
power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, where the question involved not
power but rather the exercise of power, courts have declined to rule against
the duly constituted authorities while the emergency lasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Glendon</span> Schubert
noted, the U.S. Supreme Court "was unwilling to [do so] until the war was
over and <st1:city><st1:place>Lincoln</st1:place></st1:city> was dead."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <i>Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> Milligan,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the decision voiding the petitioner's trial by a military court was not
announced until <st1:date year="1866" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1866</st1:date>,
after the Civil War was over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil
War began on <st1:date year="1861" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1861</st1:date>
with the capture of <st1:place><st1:placetype>Fort</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>Sumter</st1:placename></st1:place>
by Confederate forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lambdin</span> Milligan was charged before a military commission
with aiding rebels, inciting insurrection, disloyal practices and violation of
the laws of war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His trial ran from
September to December 1862; he was convicted on <st1:date year="1864" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1864</st1:date> and ordered executed on <st1:date year="1865" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1865</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1865" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1865</st1:date> he applied for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> from the
Circuit Court of Indianapolis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May
11, Justice Davis and Judge McDonald certified that they differed in opinion
and, therefore, pursuant to the statute of 1802, elevated their questions to
the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1865" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1865</st1:date> the death sentence was
commuted to life imprisonment by President Johnson who had succeeded to the
Presidency after the assassination of <st1:city><st1:place>Lincoln</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court heard the parties'
arguments for eight days, on March 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13, and <st1:date year="1866" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1866</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1866" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1866</st1:date> the decision of the Supreme Court voiding Milligan's trial
was announced.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>In</i></span><i> Re Moyer</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

on <st1:date year="1904" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1904</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Application for a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>

dismissed and the petitioner was remanded to the custody of the military

subsequently brought an action for damages for his imprisonment from March 30
to <st1:date year="1904" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1904</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was dismissed by the Circuit
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On writ of error, the U.S.
Supreme Court affirmed, holding that "So long as such arrests are made in
good faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the
insurrection off, the governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an
action after he is out of office, on the ground that he had no reasonable

<p class="BODY">No doubt there is a point, although controversial, in the
observation that in the instances just examined a successful challenge was
possible only retroactively, after the cessation of the hostilities which would
under any circumstances have justified the judgment of the military.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

it became the duty of the members of the Court, let alone all other government
functionaries, to take an oath to support the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that a majority of six
justices declared that the 1973 Constitution was not validly ratified, it is
equally true that a majority of six justices held that the issue of its <span class="SpellE"><i>effectivity</i></span> was a political question, which the
Court was not equipped to determine, depending as it did on factors for which
the judicial process was not fit to resolve.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolution of this question was <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> of
all the issues presented in the Ratification Cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus became untenable for the members of
the Court who held contrary opinions to press their opposition beyond the
decision of those cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fundamental
respect for the rule of law dictated that the members of the Court take an oath
to uphold the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
nothing in that solemn oath that debases their individual personal integrity or
renders them unworthy or incapable of doing justice in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did the environmental milieu of their
adjuration in any manner demean their high offices or detract from the
legitimacy of the Court as the highest judicial <span class="SpellE">collegium</span>
of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">From its Anglo-Saxon origin and throughout its slow evolution,
the concept, scope and boundaries, application, limitations and other facets of
martial law have been the subject of misunderstanding, controversy and debate.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
To the legal scholar interested in set legal principles and precise
distinctions, martial law could be a frustrating subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the matter of its definition alone, it is
known to have as many definitions as there are numerous authors and court
decisions (not to discount the dissenting opinions) on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrinal development of martial law has
relied mainly on case-law,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
and there have been relatively few truly distinctive types of occasions where
martial law, being the extraordinary remedy that it is, has been resorted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the only other notable instance when martial law was declared was on <st1:date year="1944" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1944</st1:date>, per Proclamation
No. 29 promulgated by President Jose P. Laurel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this was pursuant to the constitution of the short-lived <st1:place><st1:placename>Japanese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Occupation</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
and the event has not been known to be productive of any jurisprudential
pronouncements emanating from the high court of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the confused state of jurisprudence on the
subject of martial law in England and in the United States, and, consequently,
in the Philippines, a useful knowledge of the law on the subject can fairly be
had from a study of its historical background and its rationale, its doctrinal
development, applicable constitutional and statutory provisions, and
authoritative court decisions and commentaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Legal scholars trace the genesis of martial law to <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
starting from the age of the Tudors and the Stuarts in the 14th century when it
was first utilized for the suppression of rebellions and disorders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It later came to be employed in the British
colonies and dominions where its frequent exercise against British subjects
gave rise to the criticism that it was being exploited as a weapon to enhance
British imperialism.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
martial law was declared on numerous occasions from the revolutionary period to
the Civil War, and after the turn of the century.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the earliest instances in American
history was the declaration of martial law by Gen. Andrew Jackson before the
Battle of New Orleans in 1814.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fearing
that the <st1:city><st1:place>New Orleans</st1:place></st1:city> legislature
might capitulate to the British, he placed the State under "strict martial
law" and forbade the State legislature to convene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial law was lifted after the American
victory over British arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil War
period saw the declaration of martial law on many occasions by both the
Confederate and the Union authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has also been resorted to in cases of insurrection and rebellion, as
exemplified by the Whiskey rebellion (1794 in <st1:state><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:state>
and <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>) and the Dorr's
rebellion (1842 in <st1:state><st1:place>Rhode Island</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial law has also been utilized during
periods of disaster, such as the <st1:city><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:city>
earthquake and fire of 1906, and in industrial disputes involving violence and
disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has likewise been variously
instituted to police elections, to take charge of ticket sales at a football
game, to prevent the foreclosure of mortgages, to close a race track.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an extreme case, the governor of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
proclaimed martial law around a government building to exclude from its
premises a public official whom he was enjoined from removing.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the close of the World War I, the term "martial law"
was erroneously employed to refer to the law administered in enemy territory
occupied by the allied forces pending the armistice.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
William Winthrop states that the earlier confusion regarding the concept of
martial law, resulting partly from the wrong definition of the term by the Duke
of Wellington who had said that "it is <span class="GramE">nothing more</span>
nor less than the will of the general," had misled even the Supreme Court
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>

however, Chief Justice Chase, in his dissenting opinion, clarified and laid
down the classic distinctions between the types of <i>military jurisdiction</i>
in relation to the terms "martial law," "military law" and
"<i>military government</i>," which to a great extent cleared the
confusion in the application of these terms.</p>

<p class="BODY">These distinctions were later incorporated in the Manual for
Courts-Martial of the United States Army,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>

pursuant to Executive Order No. 178, was patterned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In essence, these distinctions are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Military jurisdiction
in relation to the term <i>military law </i>is that exercised by a government
"in the execution of that branch of its municipal law which regulates its
military establishment." (In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
this refers principally to the statutes which embody the rules of conduct and
discipline of members of their respective armed forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
we have for this purpose Commonwealth Act No. 408, as amended, otherwise known
as "The Articles of War").</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Military jurisdiction
in relation to the term<i> martial law </i>is that "exercised in time of
rebellion and civil war by a government temporarily governing the civil
population of a locality through its military forces, without the authority of
written law, as necessity may require."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>c. Military jurisdiction in relation to the term <i>military
government</i> is that "exercised by a belligerent occupying an enemy's
territory;”<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
(A familiar example of a <i>military government</i> was, of course, that
established and administered by the Japanese armed forces in the Philippines
from 1942 to 1945).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What is the universally accepted fundamental justification of
martial law?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wiener, in <i>A Practical

ventures this justification:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Martial Law is the public law of necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessity calls it forth, necessity justifies
its existence, and necessity measures the extent and degree to which it may be
employed."</p>

<p class="BODY">Martial law is founded, upon the principle that the state has a
right to protect itself against those who would destroy it, and has therefore
been likened to the right of the individual to self-defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
It is invoked as an extreme measure, and rests upon the basic principle that
every state has the power of self-preservation, a power inherent in all states,
because neither the state nor society would exist without it.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<p class="BODY">I now proceed to discuss the issues posed in these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Proclamation 1081, dated September 21, 1972, the President of
the Philippines declared that lawless elements, supported by a foreign power,
were in "armed insurrection and rebellion against the Government of the
Philippines in order to forcibly seize political and state power, overthrow the
duly constituted government and supplant our existing political, social,
economic and legal order with an entirely new one . . . based on the
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs." He enumerated many and
varied acts of violence committed in pursuance of the insurrection and
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore placed the
Philippines under martial law, commanded the armed forces to suppress the
insurrection and rebellion, enforce obedience to his decrees, orders and
regulations, and arrest and detain those engaged in the insurrection and
rebellion or in other crimes "in furtherance or on the occasion thereof,
or incident thereto or in connection therewith." The President invoked his
powers under article VII section 10(2) of the 1935 Constitution "to save
the Republic and reform our society.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By General Order No. 2 the President directed the Secretary of
National Defense to "forthwith arrest or cause the arrest . . . the
individuals named in the attached lists for being participants or for having
given aid and comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in
the country and to take over the government by force . . . in order to prevent
them from further committing acts that are inimical or injurious . . ."
The Secretary was directed to hold in custody the individuals so arrested
"until otherwise so ordered by me or by my duly designated
representative." The arrest and detention of the petitioners in these
cases appear to have been made pursuant to this order.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot blink away the stark fact of a continuing Communist
rebellion in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has repeatedly taken cognizance of
this fact in several cases decided by it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1971, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i> vs. Garcia</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court, after reviewing the history of the Communist movement in the country
since the 1930s, concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We
entertain, therefore, no doubts about the existence of a sizeable group of men
who have publicly risen in arms to overthrow the government and have thus been
and still are engaged in rebellion against the Government of the
Philippines." It affirmed this finding in 1972<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
in sustaining the validity of the Anti-Subversion Act (Republic Act 1700).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Act is itself a congressional recognition
and acute awareness of the continuing threat of Communist subversion to
democratic institutions in this country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Enacted in 1957, it has remained in the statute books despite periodic
agitation in many quarters for its total excision.</p>

<p class="BODY">At times the rebellion required no more than ordinary police action,
coupled with criminal prosecutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
the 1932 Communist trials resulted in the conviction of the well-known
Communists of the day:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> Evangelista, Jacinto G. Manahan, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Capadocia</span>, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Nabong</span> and
Juan <span class="SpellE">Feleo</span>, among others, for crimes ranging from
illegal association to rebellion and sedition.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The end of World War II saw the resurgence of the Communist
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now with an army forged out
of the former <span class="SpellE"><i>Hukbalahaps</i></span> (the armed
resistance against the Japanese) and renamed <span class="SpellE"><i>Hukbong</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">Mapagpalaya</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> </i>or HMB, the threat to the security of the state
became so malevolent that on October 22, 1950, President <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> was impelled to suspend the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
enabled the Government to <span class="GramE">effect</span> the apprehension of
top Communist Party leaders Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Capadocia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> V. Hernandez,
Jesus Lava, Jose Lava, Angel Baking and Simeon Rodriguez, among others.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
When challenged by one of those detained under the Presidential proclamation,
the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> was
sustained by the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The beginning of the 1970s was marked by the rise of student
activism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This phenomenon swept around
the globe, and did not spare our own colleges and universities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon the campuses became staging grounds for
student demonstrations that generally ended in bloody and not infrequently
lethal street riots.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Navarro vs. Villegas</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
in upholding the power of the Mayor of Manila to determine the place and time
for the holding of public assemblies, this Court noted —</p>

<blockquote>"That experiences in connection with present assemblies and
demonstrations do not warrant the Court's disbelieving respondent Mayor's
appraisal that a public rally at Plaza Miranda, as compared to one at the
Sunken Gardens as he suggested, poses a clearer and more imminent danger of
public disorders, breaches of the peace, criminal acts, and even bloodshed as
an aftermath of such assemblies, and petitioner has manifested that it has no
means of preventing such disorders;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That, consequently, every time that such assemblies are
announced, the community is placed in such a state of fear and tension that
offices are closed early and employees dismissed, storefronts boarded up,
classes suspended, and transportation disrupted, to the general detriment of
the public."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Riding on the crest of student unrest, the Communist rebellion
gained momentum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court noted in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i> vs. Garcia</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"[T]he reorganized Communist Party of the Philippines has, moreover,
adopted Mao's concept of protracted people's war, aimed at the <span class="SpellE">paralyzation</span> of the will to resist of the government, of
the political, economic and intellectual leadership, and of the people
themselves; that conformably to such concept the Party has placed special
emphasis upon a most extensive and intensive program of subversion by the
establishment of front organizations in urban centers, the organization of
armed city partisans and the infiltration in student groups, labor unions, and
farmer and professional groups; that the CPP has managed to infiltrate or
establish and control nine (9) major labor organizations; that it has exploited
the youth movement and succeeded in making Communist fronts of eleven (11)
major student or youth organizations; that there are, accordingly, about thirty
(30) mass organizations actively advancing the CPP interests, among which are
the <span class="SpellE">Malayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Magsasaka</span> (MASAKA), the <span class="SpellE">Kabataang</span> <span class="SpellE">Makabayan</span> (KM), the

Pilipino (MPKP); that, as of August, 1971, the KM had two hundred forty-five
(245) operational chapters throughout the Philippines, of which seventy-three
(73) were in the Greater Manila Area, sixty (60) in Northern Luzon, forty-nine
(49) in Central Luzon, forty-two (42) in the <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span>
and twenty-one (21) in Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>; that in
1970, the Party had recorded two hundred fifty-eight (258) major demonstrations,
of which about thirty-three (33) ended in violence, resulting in fifteen (15)
killed and over five hundred (500) injured; that most of these actions were
organized, coordinated or led by the aforementioned front organizations; that
the violent demonstrations were generally instigated by a small, but
well-trained group of armed agitators; that the number of demonstrations
heretofore staged in 1971 has already exceeded those in 1970; and that
twenty-four (24) of these demonstrations were violent, and resulted in the
death of fifteen (15) persons and the injury of many more.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The mounting level of violence necessitated the suspension, for
the second time, of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> on <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government's action was questioned in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i> vs. Garcia</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court found that the intensification and
spread of Communist insurgency imperiled the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The events after the suspension of the
privilege of the writ confirmed the alarming extent of the danger to public
safety:</p>

<blockquote>"Subsequent events — as reported — have also proven that
petitioners' counsel have underestimated the threat to public safety posed by
the New People's Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it
appears that, since August 21, 1971, it had in Northern Luzon six (6)
encounters and staged one (1) raid, in consequence of which seven (7) soldiers
lost their lives and two (2) others were wounded, whereas the insurgents
suffered five (5) casualties; that on August 26, 1971, a well-armed group of
NPA, trained by defector Lt. Victor Corpus, attacked the very command post of
TF LAWIN in <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, destroying two (2) helicopters
and one (1) plane, and wounding one (1) soldier; that the NPA had in Central
Luzon a total of four (4) encounters, with two (2) killed and three (3) wounded
on the side of the Government, one (1) BSDU killed and three (3) NPA
casualties; that in an encounter at <span class="SpellE">Botolan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, one (1) KM-SDK leader, an unidentified dissident,
and Commander <span class="SpellE">Panchito</span>, leader of the dissident
group, were killed; that on August 26, 1971, there was an encounter in the
Barrio of San Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Iriga</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, between the PC and the NPA, in which a PC and
two (2) KM members were killed; that the current disturbances in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> provinces
have been rendered more complex by the involvement of the CPP/NPA for, in
mid-1971, a KM group, headed by <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Esparagoza</span>, contacted the <span class="SpellE">Higa-onan</span>
tribes, in their settlement in <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, and offered them books, pamphlets and
brochures of Mao <span class="SpellE">Tse</span> <span class="SpellE">Tung</span>,
as well as conducted teach-ins in the reservation; that <span class="SpellE">Esparagoza</span>
was reportedly killed on September 22, 1971, in an operation of the PC in said
reservation; and that there are now two (2) NPA cadres in Mindanao.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It should, also, be noted that adherents of the CPP and its
front organizations are, according to intelligence findings, definitely capable
of preparing powerful explosives out of locally available materials; that the
bomb used in the Constitutional Convention Hall was a 'clay-more' mine, a
powerful explosive device used by the U.S. Army, believed to have been one of
many pilfered from the <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Naval Base a few days
before; that the President had received intelligence information to the effect
that there was a July-August Plan involving a wave of assassinations,
kidnappings, terrorism and mass destruction of property and that an
extraordinary occurrence would signal the beginning of said event; that the
rather serious condition of peace and order in Mindanao, particularly in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, demanded the
presence therein of forces sufficient to cope with the situation; that a
sizeable part of our armed forces discharges other functions; and that the
expansion of the CPP activities from Central Luzon to other parts of the
country, particularly Manila and its suburbs, the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
Valley, <span class="SpellE">Ifugao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,

to the President only in cases where the Assembly was not in session and then
only with the consent of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;

They rejected the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> proposal and adopted

which, adapted to the exigencies of colonial administration, naturally made the
Governor General a strong Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Construing a similar provision of the Philippine Bill of 1902
which authorized the Governor General, with the approval of the Philippine
Commission, to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
"when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety
may require it," this Court held that the Governor General's finding as to
the necessity for such action was "conclusive and final" on the

there is language that appears to detract from the uniform course of judicial
construction of the Commander-in-­Chief Clause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But a close reading of the opinion in that case shows that in the main
there was adherence to precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be
sure, the Court there asserted the power to inquire into the "existence of
the factual bases [for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>] in order to determine the sufficiency thereof." But this broad
assertion of power is qualified by the Court's unambiguous statement that
"the function of the Court is merely to check — not to supplant — the
Executive, or to ascertain merely whether he has gone beyond the constitutional
limits of his jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested in him or to
determine the wisdom of his act." For this reason this Court announced
that the test was not whether the President acted correctly but whether he
acted arbitrarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact this Court
read <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as authorizing judicial inquiry into "whether or not there really was a rebellion,
as stated in the proclamation therein contested."</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course the judicial department can determine the existence of
the conditions for the exercise of the President's powers and is not bound by
the recitals of his proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
whether in the circumstances obtaining public safety requires the suspension of
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or the proclamation of
martial law is initially for the President to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considerations of commitment of the power to
the executive branch of the Government and the lack of accepted standards for
dealing with incommensurable factors, suggest the wisdom of considering the
President's finding as to necessity persuasive upon the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion results from the nature of
the power vested in the President and from the evident object
contemplated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For that power is intended
to enable the Government to cope with sudden emergencies and meet great
occasions of state under circumstances that may be crucial to the life of the

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="GramE">courts are open and in the

absence of any justification for martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ruling in <i>Milligan</i><a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></i></span></a>

is invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases the U.S.
Supreme Court reversed convictions by military commissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <i>Milligan </i>the Court stated that
"martial law cannot arise from a threatened invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necessity must be actual and present, the
invasion real, such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil
administration." In <st1:city><st1:place><i>Duncan</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>
</i>a similar expression was made:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The phrase 'martial law' . . . while intended to authorize the
military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government
and for the defense of the <st1:place>Islands</st1:place> against actual or
threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting
of courts by military tribunals.”</p>

<p class="BODY">But <i>Milligan</i> and <i>Duncan</i> were decided on the basis
of a widely disparate constitutional provision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, to the extent that they may be regarded as embodying what
the petitioners call an "open court” theory, they are of doubtful
applicability in the context of <i>present-day</i> subversion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unlike the detailed provision of our Constitution, the U.S.
Federal Constitution does not explicitly authorize the U.S. President to
proclaim martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply states
in its article II, section 2 that "the President shall be
Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and of the Militia of the several
States, when called into the actual Service of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. . . ." On the other hand, our
Constitution authorizes the proclamation of martial law in cases not only of
actual invasion, insurrection or rebellion but also of "imminent
danger" thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <st1:city><st1:place><i>Duncan</i></st1:place></st1:city>
the U.S. Supreme Court dealt with a <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
statute that in terms was similar to the Philippine Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 67 of the Hawaiian Organic Act
provided that "[the Territorial Governor] may, in case of invasion, or
imminent danger thereof, when public safety requires it, suspend the privilege
of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, or place the Territory, or any part
thereof under martial law until communication can be had with the President [of
the United States] and his decision thereon made known." In fact the
Hawaiian Organic Act, that of Puerto Rico, and the Jones Law of 1916, from
which latter law, as I have earlier noted, the Commander-in-Chief Clause of our
Constitution was adopted, were part of the legislation of the U.S. Congress
during the colonial period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But again,
unlike the Jones Law, the Hawaiian Organic Act also provided in its section 5
that the U.S. Federal Constitution "shall have the same force and effect
in the Territory [of <st1:state><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state>] as
elsewhere in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
For this reason it was held in <st1:city><st1:place><i>Duncan</i></st1:place></st1:city>
that "imminent danger" of invasion or rebellion was not a ground for
authorizing the trial of civilians by a military tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had <st1:city><st1:place><i>Duncan</i></st1:place></st1:city>
been decided solely on the basis of section 67 of the Hawaiian Organic Act and
had the petitioners in that case been tried for offenses connected with the
prosecution of the war,<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
the prison sentences imposed by the military tribunals would in all probability
have been upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact
those who argued in <st1:city><st1:place><i>Duncan</i></st1:place></st1:city>
that the power of the Hawaiian governor to proclaim martial law comprehended
not only actual rebellion or invasion but also "imminent danger
thereof" were faced with the problem of reconciling the two parts of the
Hawaiian Organic Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contended
that "if any part of section 67 would otherwise be unconstitutional section
5 must be construed as extending the [<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>]
Constitution to <st1:state><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:state> subject to
the qualifications or limitations contained in section 67."<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Forsooth, if the power to proclaim martial law is at all
recognized in American federal constitutional law, it is only by implication
from the necessity of self-preservation and then subject to the narrowest
possible construction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there any State Constitution in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, as the appended list indicates (see
Appendix), which in scope and explicitness can compare with the
Commander-in-Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Clause
of our Constitution.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Alaska
Constitution, for example, authorizes the governor to proclaim martial law when
the public safety requires it in case of rebellion or actual or imminent
invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even then it also provides
that martial law shall not last longer than twenty days unless approved by a
majority of the legislature in joint session.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the present Constitution of Hawaii does not grant to
the State governor the power to suspend the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or to
proclaim martial law as did its Organic Act before its admission as a State to
the American Union.</p>

<p class="BODY">An uncritical reading of <i>Milligan</i> and <i>Duncan</i> is
likely to overlook these crucial differences in textual concepts between the
Philippine Constitution, on the one hand, and the Federal and State
Constitutions of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our case then the
inclusion of the "imminent danger" phrase as a ground for the
suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and for the
proclamation of martial law was a matter of deliberate choice and renders the
language of <i>Milligan</i> ("martial law cannot arise from a threatened
invasion") inapposite arid therefore inapplicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Bill of 1902 provided in its section 2, paragraph
7 —</p>

<blockquote>"that the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall
not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion
the public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be
suspended by the President, or by the Governor General with the approval of the
Philippine Commission, wherever during such period the necessity for such
suspension shall exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Jones Law of 1916 substantially reenacted this
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus section 3, paragraph 7 thereof
provided:</p>

<blockquote>"That the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall
not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion
the public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be
suspended by the President or by the Governor General, wherever during such
period the necessity for such suspension shall exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the Jones Law provided in its section 21 that —</p>

<blockquote>". . . [The Governor General] may, in case of rebellion or
invasion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it,
suspend the privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, or place the
Islands, or any part thereof, under martial law:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Provided</i>, That whenever the Governor
General shall exercise this authority, he shall at once notify the President of
the United States thereof, together with the attending facts and circumstances,
and the President shall have power to modify or vacate the action of the
Governor General."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Note that with respect to the suspension of the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, section 21 mentions, as ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, "imminent danger" of invasion or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Constitution was
drafted in 1934, its framers, as I have already noted, decided to adopt these
provisions of the Jones Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
section 3, paragraph 7, in the Jones Law became section 1[14] of article III
(Bill of Rights) of the Constitution; and what was section 21 became article
VII, section 10(2) (Commander-in-Chief Clause).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the Bill of Rights provision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not
be suspended except in cases of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, when the
public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be suspended
wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall
exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Commander-in-Chief Clause states:</p>

<blockquote>"The President shall be commander-in?chief of all armed
forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it, he may suspend the privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The attention of the 1934 Convention was drawn to the apparent
inconsistency between the Bill of Rights provision and the <b>Commander-in-Chief
Clause</b>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some delegates tried to
harmonize the two provisions by inserting the <b>phrase "imminent danger
thereof"</b> in the Bill of Rights provision, but on reconsideration the
Convention deleted the phrase from the draft of the Bill of Rights provision,
at the same time retaining it in the Commander-in-Chief Clause.</p>

questioning the validity of President <span class="SpellE">Quirino's</span>
suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus,</i> this Court
sustained the President's power to suspend the privilege of the writ even on
the ground of imminent danger of invasion, insurrection or rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that as the Commander-in-Chief Clause
was last in the order of time and local position it should be deemed
controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rationalization has
evoked the criticism that the Constitution was approved as a whole and not in
parts, but in result the decision in that case is certainly consistent with the
conception of a strong Executive to which the 1934 Constitutional Convention
was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1973 Constitution likewise authorizes the suspension of the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> on the ground of imminent danger
of invasion, insurrection or rebellion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The so-called "open court" theory does not apply to the
Philippine situation because our 1935 and 1973 Constitutions expressly
authorize the declaration of martial law even where the danger to public safety
arises merely from the imminence of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the theory is too simplistic for
our day, <i>what with the universally recognized insidious nature of Communist
subversion and its covert operations</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed the theory has been dismissed as unrealistic by perceptive
students of Presidential powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Charles <span class="SpellE">Fairman</span> says:</p>

<blockquote>"These measures are unprecedented but so is the danger that

even the aerial attack upon <st1:place>Pearl Harbor</st1:place> closed the courts

locality of actual war,' and also that it 'can never exist when the courts are
open and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.' But
this ruling was made by a bare majority — five — of the court, at a time of
great political excitement, and the opinion of the four other members, as
delivered by the Chief Justice, was to the effect that martial law is not
necessarily limited to time of war, but may be exercised at other periods of
'public danger,' and that the fact that the civil courts are open is not
controlling against such exercise, since they 'might be open and undisturbed in
the execution of their functions and yet wholly incompetent to avert threatened
danger or to punish with adequate promptitude and certainty the guilty.' It is
the opinion of the author that the view of the minority of the court is the
sounder and more reasonable one, and that the dictum of the majority was
influenced by a confusing of martial law proper with that <i>military
government</i> which exists only at a time and on the theatre of war, and which
was clearly distinguished from martial law by the Chief Justice in the
dissenting opinion — the first complete judicial definition of the
subject."<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>

the Court sustained the authority of a State governor to hold temporarily in
custody one whom he believed to be engaged in fomenting trouble, and denied
recovery against the governor for the imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was said that, as the governor "may
kill persons who resist," he "may use the milder measure of seizing
the bodies of those whom he considers in the way of restoring peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such arrests are not necessarily for punishment,
but are by way of precaution to prevent the exercise of hostile power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as such arrests are made in good
faith and in the honest belief that they are needed in order to head the
insurrection off, the Governor is the final judge and cannot be subjected to an
action after he is out of office on the ground that he had no reasonable ground
for his belief."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <i>Sterling vs. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
the same Court set aside the action of a State governor taken under martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the decision in that case
rested on the ground that the action set aside had no direct relation to the
quelling of the uprising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the
governor of Texas issued a proclamation stating that certain counties were in a
state of insurrection and declaring martial law in that territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation recited that there was an
organized group of oil and gas producers in insurrection against conservation
laws of the State and that this condition had wrought such a state of public
feeling that if the State government could not protect the public's interest
they would take the law into their own hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proclamation further recited that it was necessary that the Railroad
Commission be given time to make orders regarding oil production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Commission issued an order limiting
oil production, the complainants brought suit in the District Court which
issued restraining orders, whereupon Governor Sterling ordered General <span class="SpellE">Wolters</span> of the Texas National Guards to enforce a limit on
oil production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was this order of the
State governor that the District Court enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal the U.S. Supreme Court
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After assuming that the
governor had the power to declare martial law, the Court held that the order
restricting oil production was not justified by the exigencies of the
situation.</p>

<blockquote>" . . . Fundamentally, the question here is not the power of
the Governor to proclaim that a state of insurrection, or tumult, or riot, or
breach of the peace exists, and that it is necessary to call military force to
the aid of the civil power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does the
question relate to the quelling of disturbance and the overcoming of unlawful
resistance to civil authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question before us is simply with respect to the Governor's attempt to regulate
by executive order the lawful use of complainants' properties in the production
of oil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of affording them
protection in the exercise of their rights as determined by the courts, he
sought, by his executive orders, to make that exercise impossible."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, what is involved here is the validity of the
detention order under which the petitioners were ordered arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such order is, as I have already stated, a
valid incident of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
respect to such question <span class="SpellE"><i>Constantin</i></span> held that
"measures, conceived in good faith, in the face of the emergency and
directly related to the quelling of the disorder or the prevention of its
continuance, fall within the discretion of the Executive in the exercise of his
authority to maintain peace."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus evident that suspension of the <i>privilege</i> of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is unavoidably subsumed in a declaration of
martial law, since one basic objective of martial rule is to neutralize effectively
— by arrest and continued detention (and possibly trial at the proper and
opportune time) — those who are reasonably believed to be in complicity or are <span class="SpellE"><i>particeps</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">criminis</span></i>
in the insurrection or rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
this is so and should be so is ineluctable; to deny this postulate is to negate

of martial law and at the same time dissipate its efficacy by withdrawing from
its ambit the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
is a proposition I regard as fatuous and therefore repudiate.</p>

<blockquote>"Invasion and insurrection, both of them conditions of

<blockquote>"The point here is whether martial law is simply a shorthand
expression denoting the suspension of the writ, or whether martial law involves
not only the suspension of the writ but much more besides. . . . The latter
view is probably sounder because martial law, certainly in the present state of
its development, is not at all dependent on a suspension of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>. . . . Where there has been violence or disorder in fact, continued
detention of offenders by the military is so far proper as to result in a
denial by the courts of writs releasing those detained. . . .”<a style="" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sum and substance, I firmly adhere to these views:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the proclamation of martial law in
September 1972 by the President was well within the aegis of the 1935
Constitution; (2) that because the Communist rebellion had not abated and
instead the evil ferment of subversion had proliferated throughout the
archipelago and in many places had exploded into the roar of armed and searing
conflict with all the sophisticated panoply of war, the imposition of martial
law was an "imperative of national survival;" (3) that the arrest and
detention of persons who were "participants or gave aid and comfort in the
conspiracy to seize political and state power and to take over the government
by force," were not<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>unconstitutional nor arbitrary; (4) that subsumed in the declaration of
martial law is the suspension of the <i>privilege</i> of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>; (5) that the fact that the regular courts of justice are open
cannot be accepted as proof that the rebellion and insurrection, which
compellingly called for the declaration of martial law, no longer imperil the
public safety; (6) that actual armed combat has been and still is raging in <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>, not to
mention the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> Region and <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
Valley, and nationwide Communist subversion continues unabated; (7) that the
host of doubts that had plagued this Court with respect to the validity of the
ratification and consequent <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the 1973
Constitution has been completely dispelled by every rational evaluation of the
national referendum of July 1973, at which the people conclusively, albeit
quietly, demonstrated nationwide acquiescence in the new Constitution; and (8)
that the issue of the validity and constitutionality of the arrest and
detention of all the petitioners and of the restrictions imposed upon those who
were subsequently freed, is now foreclosed by the transitory provision of the
1973 Constitution (Art. XVII, Sec. 3(2)) which efficaciously validates all acts
made, done or taken by the President, or by others upon his instructions, under
the regime of martial law, prior to the ratification of the said Constitution.</p>

England has an unwritten constitution, there is not even a bare mention of
martial law in the Federal and in most of the State constitutions of the United
States (see <i>Appendix </i>to this separate opinion), and there is a paucity

Commonwealth Act No. 408 recognizes the eventuality of the declaration of
martial law in its Articles of War 2, 37, 82 and 83.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The AFP Manual for Courts-Martial defines
martial law as "the exercise of military jurisdiction by a government temporarily
governing the civil population of a locality through its military forces,
without authority of written law, as necessity may require." Martial law,
as thus exercisable, is in many respects comparable to the <i>state of siege</i>
of the continental nations of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>.</p>

defines martial law as 'simply military authority, exercised in accordance with

law of necessity in the actual presence of war' . . . Upon the actual scene of
war, martial law becomes indistinguishable from military government." <span class="GramE">(Willoughby, <i>The Constitutional Law of the United States</i>,

President Marcos writes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The

arises out of the seven grave threats to the existence of the Republic:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the communist rebellion, the rightist

levels of society, the criminal and criminal-political syndicates — including
the private armies — deteriorating economy and the increasing social

The <i>Times Journal, Bulletin Today</i> and <i>Daily Express</i>, on Wednesday,
August 28, 1974, carried news of a nationwide arms-smuggling network being
operated by the Communist Party of the Philippines in collaboration with a
foreign-based source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department of
National Defense reported that several arms-smuggling vessels had been seized,
that the network had acquired several trucking services for its illegal
purposes, and that about P2 million had so far been expended for this operation
by a foreign source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department stressed
that "the clandestine network is still operating with strong indications
that several arms landings have already been made." The Department also
revealed that the military has "launched necessary countermeasures in
order to dismantle in due time this extensive anti-government operation." The
Department finally confirmed the arrest of 38 subversives, including the
following 13 persons who occupy important positions in the hierarchy of the

President Jose P. Laurel, in a speech on the draft of the 1935 Constitution,
gave as reasons for the adoption of the Commander-in-Chief Clause (a) the
desire of the members of the 1934 Constitutional Convention to afford the state
with an effective means for self-defense (the experience of the Latin-American
countries was an object lesson for the Convention), and (b) the sense of the
Convention that the executive power should be made stronger (Malcolm and

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ESGUERRA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><i>A. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>,
the President issued Proclamation No. 1081 placing the whole <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proclamation was
publicly announced by the President over the television and radio on the
evening of <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grounds for the proclamation are recited
in detail in its preamble, specifically mentioning various acts of insurrection
and rebellion already perpetrated and about to be committed against the
Government by the lawless elements of the country in order to gain political
control of the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After laying down
the basis for the establishment of martial law, the President ordered:</p>

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the
Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10,
Paragraph (2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as
defined in Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in
my capacity as their commander-in-chief, do hereby command the armed forces of
the Philippines to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent
suppress all forms of lawless violence as well, as any act of insurrection or
rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees orders and
regulations promulgated by me personally or upon my direction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently detained,
as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the crimes of
insurrection or rebellion; and all other crimes and offenses committed in
furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in connection
therewith, for crimes against national security and the law of nations, crimes
against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority, rank, title and
improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed by public
officers, and for such, other crimes as will be enumerated in orders that I
shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a consequence of any
violation of any decree, order or regulation promulgated by me personally or
promulgated upon my direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise
ordered released by me or by my duly designated representative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Issued shortly after the proclamation was General Order No. 2,
followed by No. 2-A, dated September 26, 1972, to which was attached a list of
the names of various persons who had taken part in the various acts of
insurrection, rebellion and subversion mentioned in the proclamation, and given
aid and comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in the
country and take over the government by force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were ordered to be apprehended immediately and taken into custody
by the Secretary of National Defense who was to act as representative of the
President in carrying out martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners herein were on September 22 and 23, 1972,
arrested and taken into military custody by the Secretary of National Defense
pursuant to General Order No. 2-A of the President for being included in said
list as having participated, directly or indirectly, or given aid and comfort
to those engaged in the conspiracy and plot to seize political and state power
and to take over the Government by force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They ask this Court to set them at liberty, claiming that their arrest
and detention is illegal and unconstitutional since the proclamation of martial
law is arbitrary and without basis and the alleged grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
do not exist and the courts are open and normally functioning.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the respondents the Solicitor General in his answer maintains
that Proclamation No. 1081 is Constitutional and valid, having been issued in
accordance with the Constitution; that the orders and decrees issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> are valid; that the arrest and detention of
petitioners pursuant thereto is likewise valid, legal and constitutional, and
that this Court should refrain from issuing the desired writs as these cases
involve a political question.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of issues, these cases
were heard on September 26 and 29, 1972, and on <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1972</st1:date>, followed by the filing of Memoranda and
Notes on the arguments of both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">After submission of these cases for decision, petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> filed a motion to be allowed to withdraw his
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the motion is attached a
handwritten letter of said petitioner to his counsel stating the reasons why he
wished to withdraw his petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
principal reasons advanced by him for his action are his doubts and misgivings
on whether he can still obtain justice from this Court as at present
constituted since three of the Justices among the four who held in the
ratification cases that there was no valid ratification of the New Constitution
signed on November 30, 1972, and proclaimed ratified by the President on January
17, 1973 (the then Chief Justice having retired), had taken an oath to support
and defend the said Constitution; that in filing his petition he expected it to
be decided by the Supreme Court under the 1935 Constitution, and that with the
oath-taking of the three remaining members, he can no longer expect to obtain
justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the motion to withdraw had been deliberated upon by the
Court, seven justices voted to grant and five voted to deny the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no majority to grant the motion,
it was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who voted to deny
the motion are of the view that it is not simply a matter of right to withdraw
because of the great public interest involved in his case which should be
decided for the peace and tranquility of the nation, and because of the
contemptuous statement of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> that this
Court is no longer capable of administering justice to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question should no longer stand on the
way to the disposition of these cases on the merits.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">B. THE ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the question of
jurisdiction which the Solicitor General raised by reason of the President's
General Order No. 3, dated September 22, 1972, as amended by General Order No.
3-A, dated September 24, 1972, which allowed the judicial courts, to regularly
function but inhibited them from taking cognizance of cases involving the
validity, legality or constitutionality of the Martial Law Proclamation, or any
decree, order or acts issued, promulgated or performed by the President or his
duly authorized representative pursuant thereto, from which position he
relented and he has, accordingly, refrained from pressing that issue upon the
Court, the main issues for resolution are the validity of Proclamation No. 1081
declaring and establishing martial law and whether this Court can inquire into
the veracity and sufficiency of the facts constituting the grounds for its
issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">I maintain that Proclamation No. 1081 is constitutional, valid
and binding; that the veracity or sufficiency of its factual bases cannot be
inquired into by the Courts and that the question presented by the petitions is
political in nature and not <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proclamation No. 1081 was issued by the President pursuant to
Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2, of the Constitution of 1935, which reads
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The President shall be commander-in-chief of all armed forces
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to
prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision may, for present purposes, be called the
Commander-in-Chief clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above provision has no counterpart in the Constitution of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or in that of any state thereof except that of <st1:state><st1:place>Alaska</st1:place></st1:state>
to a limited extent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To comprehend the
scope and extent of the President's power to declare martial law, let us trace
the background and origin of this provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">To suppress the great rebellion in the United Slates, known as
the Civil War, which was aimed to wreck the Federal Union, President Lincoln
exercised powers not granted to him by the Constitution of the United Slates
but pertaining to the Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; proclaimed martial law in
certain areas and Military Commissions were organized where it was deemed
necessary to do so in order to subdue the rebels or prevent their sympathizers
from promoting the rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Lincoln</st1:place></st1:city>
justified his acts by saying:</p>

<blockquote>"I did understand . . . that my oath to preserve the
Constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving,
by every indispensable means that government — that nation — of which that
Constitution was the organic law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it
possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By general law, life and limb must be
protected, yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but, a life is
never, wisely given to save a limb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful by becoming
indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution through the preservation
of the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right or wrong, I assumed
this ground, and now avow it …" (2 <span class="SpellE">Nicholay</span> and
Hay, Abraham Lincoln Complete Works, 508 (1902)).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sydney G. Fisher in his work entitled "Suspension of Habeas
Corpus during the War of the Rebellion," 3 <span class="SpellE">Pol</span>.
Science Quarterly, expressed the same idea when he said:</p>

<blockquote>"... Every man thinks he has a right to live and every
government thinks it has a right to live. Every man when driven to the wall by
a murderous assailant will override all laws to protect himself, and this is
called the great right of self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So every government, when driven to the wall by a rebellion, will
trample down a constitution before it will allow itself to be destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may not be constitutional law, but it is
fact." (Pp. 454, 484-485)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But the difficulty occasioned by the absence of a constitutional
power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and to proclaim
martial law, which greatly hamstrung Lincoln in coping effectively with the
civil war, was obviated when our own Constitution expressly provided for the
grant of that presidential power (Art. VII, Section 10, par. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the legislative power under the Bill
of Rights of our Constitution (Article III, Section 1, paragraph 14, 1935
Constitution), the President can suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus and impose martial law in cases of imminent danger of invasion,
insurrection or rebellion when the public safety requires it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Congress could not have been granted the
power to suspend in case of imminent danger as it is not by the nature of its
office in a position to determine promptly the existence of such
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can only see or witness
the actual occurrence thereof and when they happen, Congress is also empowered
to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as an exercise of
legislative power when the President fails to act; but under no circumstances
can it declare martial law as this power is exclusively lodged in the President
as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the Philippine Constitution of 1935 was written, the framers
decided to adopt the provisions of Section 3, paragraph 7, of the Jones Law,
which became Article III, Section 1, paragraph 14, of the 1935 Constitution,
and those of Section 21 of the Jones Law which became Article VII, Section 10, <span class="GramE">paragraph</span> 2, of the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Jones Law provisions read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 3, paragraph 7 of the Jones Law provided:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the
public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be
suspended by the President, or by the Governor-General, wherever during such
period the necessity for such suspension shall exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And Section 21 of the same law in part provided that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . (H)e (referring to the Governor-General) may, in case of
rebellion or invasion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety
requires it, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the
Islands, or any part thereof, under martial law: <i>Provided </i>That whenever
the Governor-General shall exercise this authority, he shall at once notify the
President of the United States thereof, together with the attending facts and
circumstances, and the President shall have power to modify or vacate the
action of the Governor-General.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Before the Jones Law, the Philippine Bill
of 1902 provided as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not
be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the
public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be
suspended by the President, or by the Governor-General with the approval of the
Philippine Commission, whenever during such period the necessity for such
suspension shall exist."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Section 2, par. 7)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Philippine Bill of 1902 had no
provision pertaining to the declaration of martial law.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The adoption of the Jones Law provisions was prompted by the
prevailing sentiment among the delegates to the 1934-1935 Constitutional
Convention to establish a strong executive, as shown by its proceedings
reported by two of its prominent delegates (Laurel and <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>)
who recounted in their published works how the delegates blocked the move to
subject the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, in
cases of invasion, insurrection or rebellion, to the approval of the National
Assembly, but did nothing to block, and allowed, the grant of the power, including
that to declare martial law, to the President as Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is evident from this
incident is that when it comes to the suspension of the privilege of the writ
of <i>habeas corpus </i>and establishment of martial law in case of imminent
danger of the contingencies mentioned therein, and the public safety requires
it, the clear intent was to exclusively vest in the President that power,
whereas Congress can only suspend under the Bill of Rights provision when there
is actual occurrence of these events for reasons already adverted to above. And
when martial law is proclaimed, the suspension of the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus necessarily follows, for the greater power includes the less.
Nobody will ever doubt that there are greater restrictions to individual
liberty and freedom under martial law than under suspension of the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former
he can even close the courts if necessary and establish in their place military
commissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter, the action
proceeds from the premise that the courts are open but cannot grant the writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the Constitution of 1935 was being framed, the prevailing
jurisprudence on the matter was that laid down in <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span>
<i>vs</i>. Baker, 5 Phil. 87, <st1:date year="1905" day="30" month="9"><span class="GramE">September</span> 30, 1905</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case the question presented and
decided is identical to what is raised the petitioners here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court (1905) ruled that the judiciary
may not inquire into the facts and circumstances upon which the then Governor
General suspended the privilege of the writ under Section 5 of the Philippine
Bill of 1902, which granted him the same power now vested in the President, and
that the findings of the Governor General were "final and conclusive"
upon the courts. Aware of this rule, the framers of the 1935 Constitution
granted to the President the powers now found in Article VII, Section 10,
paragraph 2, of the 1935 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1950, Proclamation No. 210 suspending the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was issued by the late President <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assailed
before this Court in Montenegro <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balao</span>, 91 Phil. 882, as unconstitutional and
unfounded, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"And we agree with the Solicitor General that in the light of
the views of the United States Supreme Court thru Marshall, Taney and Story
quoted with approval in <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i>vs</i>. Baker (5
Phil. 87, pp. 98 and 100) <i>the authority to decide whether the exigency has
arisen requiring suspension belongs to the President and 'his decision is final
and conclusive' upon the courts and upon all other persons."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i>vs</i>. Garcia,
L-33964, decided December 11, 1971, 42 SCRA, 448, this Court asserted the power
to inquire into the constitutional sufficiency of the factual bases supporting
the President's action in suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
under Proclamation No. 889, dated August 21, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In departing from the rule established in the
Baker and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> cases, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The weight of <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i>vs</i>.
Baker, as a precedent, is diluted by two (2) factors, namely: (a) it relied
heavily upon Martin <i>vs</i>. Mott involving the U.S. President's power to <i>call
out the militia</i>, which, he being the commander-in-chief of all the armed
forces, may be exercised to suppress or prevent any lawless violence, even
without invasion, insurrection or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, and
is, accordingly, much broader than his authority to suspend the privilege of
the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, jeopardizing as the latter does individual
liberty; and (b) the privilege had been suspended by the American
Governor-General, whose act, as representative of the Sovereign, affecting the
freedom of its subjects, can hardly be equated with that of the President of
the Philippines dealing with the freedom of the Filipino people, <i>in whom
sovereignty resides, and from whom all government authority emanates</i>. The
pertinent ruling in the Montenegro case was based mainly upon the <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> case, and, hence, cannot have more weight than the
same. . .”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I maintain that we should return to the rule in the Baker and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> cases and jettison the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
doctrine which denies the grant of full, plenary and unrestricted power to the
President to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and declare
martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This denial of unrestricted
power is not in keeping with the intent and purpose behind the constitutional
provision involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Act of Congress of 1795 involved in Martin &amp; Mott (12
Wheat 19 (1827)) which is the main prop of the Baker case, held inapplicable in
<span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> case, provided:</p>

<blockquote>"That whenever the United States shall be invaded or be in
imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe, it shall
be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth such number of
the militia of the State or States most convenient to the place of danger or
scene of action, as he may judge necessary to repel such invasion . . ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The distinction made by this Court between the power of the
President to call out the militia and his power to suspend the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus and declare martial law does not warrant a different
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The important and decisive
point to consider is that both powers are expressly conferred upon the
President by the same Section, exercisable only upon the existence of certain
facts and situations. Under the 1935 Constitution (Article VII, Section 10,
paragraph 2,) both powers are embraced in the President's power as
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Baker decision should not have been emasculated by comparing
the position then of the Governor General "as the representative of the
Sovereign" in relation to the Filipinos who were its
"subjects".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under prevailing
conditions and democratic principles, there would be greater justification for
relying on the, judgment of the President of the Philippines who is the chosen
representative of the Filipino people and hence more authoritative in speaking
for the nation than on that of an American Governor General who then
personified the burden of an imposed sovereignty upon us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as the Executive of this Government who
is charged with the responsibility of executing the laws, he is as much a
guardian of the rights and liberties of the people as any court of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To judicially undercut the force and efficacy
of the Baker and Montenegro doctrine is to ride rough shod over the intent of
the framers of the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, it may be stated that the Commander-in-­Chief clause
was retained in the 1973 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> case tried to
cushion the blow administered to the constitutional provision involved by
adopting the test of "reasonableness" in the exercise of the
President's power, without meaning to substitute its judgment for that of the
President, yet the effect of the ruling is so far reaching that it may lead to
a serious confrontation between the Courts and the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to inquire into the constitutional
sufficiency of the factual bases of the habeas corpus proclamation (grounds for
the issuance of which are the same as those for martial law) presupposes the
power, to know <span class="GramE">what are the facts to be tested by the
constitutional provision</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the essence of an inquiry; the determination of the constitutional sufficiency
of those facts simply follows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose
this Court says they are not sufficient to justify martial law and the
President says they are because the evidence on which he acted shows the
existence of invasion, insurrection or rebellion, or the imminent danger
thereof, what will happen?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The outcome
is too unpleasant to contemplate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us
not try to repeat in our country what transpired between President Lincoln and
Chief Justice Taney when the latter issued a writ of habeas corpus to set free
one held by the military and President Lincoln practically said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Taney has issued his writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let him enforce it". Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> <span class="SpellE">Merryman</span>, 17 Fed. Casa 144
(No. 9487) (C.C.D. Md. 1861):</p>

<p class="BODY">President Lincoln, in the face of the grave danger then to the
nation, simply ignored it and nothing could be done about it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The test of reasonableness, or absence of arbitrariness in the
exercise of the presidential power, is all a play of words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of the reasonableness of
the act of the President calls for a consideration of the availability and
choice of less drastic alternatives for the President to take, and when that is
done the Court will in effect be substituting its judgment for that of the
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Court were to limit
its powers to ascertaining whether there is evidence to support the exercise of
the President's power, without determining whether or not such evidence is
true, we would have the curious spectacle of this Court having no choice but to
give its imprimatur to the validity of the presidential proclamation, as it did
in the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> case where it merely accepted the
reports of the military on the facts relied upon by the President in issuing
Proclamation No. 889, without judicially determining whether or not the
contents of those reports were true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
so doing, this Court simply displayed the miserable limits of its competence
for having no means for checking whether or not those facts are true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been more in keeping with the
dignity, prestige and proper role of this Court to simply read and consider the
bases for the suspension as stated in the various "<span class="SpellE">whereases</span>"
of the Proclamation, and then determine whether they are in conformity with the
constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This to me is the extent
of its power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To transcend it is to
usurp or interfere with the exercise of a presidential prerogative.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court should not spurn the reminder that it is not the
source of the panacea for all ills affecting the body politic (Vera <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>, 77 Phil. 192).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When a particular cure can come only from the political department, it
should refrain from injecting itself into the clash of political forces
contending for the settlement of a public question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of when and how a
constitutionally granted presidential power should be exercised calls for the
strict observance of the time-honored principle of the separation of powers and
respect for a co-equal, coordinate and independent branch of the
Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the basic foundation
of the rule governing the handling of a political question that is beyond
judicial competence (<span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, 46 Phil. 35; <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> <i>vs</i>.
Francisco, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L­-4638, May 8, 1951; Baker <i>vs</i>.
Carr, 360 U.S. p. 186; 82 S. Ct. Rep. 69; 7 L. Ed. 2nd, 663).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is high time to reexamine and repudiate
the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> doctrine and give the President the sole
authority to decide when and how to exercise his own constitutional
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A return to the sanity and
wisdom of the Baker and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> doctrine and a
realization that judicial power is unwelcome when a question presents
attributes that render it incapable of judicial determination, because the
power to decide it devolves on another entity, is urgently needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worthwhile recalling what this Court in
its sobriety and wisdom, unperturbed by the formidable <span class="SpellE">turmoils</span>,
the fierce passions and emotions and the stresses of our times, said in the
Baker case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The term "Governor
General" should read "President").</p>

<blockquote>"If the investigation and findings of the President, or the
Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, are not
conclusive and final as against the judicial department of the Government, then
every officer whose duty it is to maintain order and protect the lives and
property of the people may refuse to act, and apply to the judicial department
of the Government for another investigation and conclusion concerning the same
conditions, to the end that they may be protected against civil actions
resulting from illegal acts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Owing to conditions at times, a state of insurrection,
rebellion or invasion may arise suddenly and may jeopardize the very existence
of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suppose, for example, that
one of the thickly populated Governments situated near this Archipelago,
anxious to extend its power and territory, should suddenly decide to invade these
Islands, and should, without warning, appear in one of the remote harbors with
a powerful fleet and at once begin to land troops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The governor or military commander of the
particular district or province notifies the Governor-General by telegraph of
this landing of troops and that the people of the district are in collusion
with such invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Might not the
Governor-General and the Commission accept this telegram as sufficient evidence
and proof of the facts communicated and at once take steps, even to the extent
of suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, as might
appear to them to be necessary to repel such invasion?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that all men interested in the
maintenance and stability of the Government would answer this question in the <span class="GramE">affirmative ...</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But suppose some one, who has been arrested in the district
upon the ground that his detention would assist in restoring order and in
repelling the invasion, applies for the writ of habeas corpus, alleging that no
invasion actually exists; may the judicial department of the Government call
the officers actually engaged in the field before it and away from their posts
of duty for the purpose of explaining and furnishing proof to it concerning the
existence or nonexistence of the facts proclaimed to exist by the legislative
and executive branches of the State?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
so, then the courts may effectually tie the hands of the executive, whose
special duty it is to enforce the laws and maintain order, until the invaders
have actually accomplished their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The interpretation contended for here by the applicants, so pregnant
with detrimental results, could not have been intended by the Congress of the
United States when it enacted the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is the duty of the legislative branch of the Government to
make such laws and regulations as will effectually conserve peace and good
order and protect the lives and property of the citizens of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the Governor-General to
take such steps as he deems wise and necessary for the purpose of enforcing
such laws. Every delay and hindrance and obstacle which prevents a strict
enforcement of laws under the conditions mentioned necessarily tends to
jeopardize public interests and the safety of the whole people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the judicial department of the Government,
or any officer in the Government, has a right to contest the orders of the
President or of the Governor-General under the conditions above supposed,
before complying with such orders, then the hands of the President or the
Governor-General may be tied until the very object of the rebels or <span class="SpellE">insurrectors</span> or invaders has been accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is urged that the President, or the
Governor-General with the approval of the Philippine Commission, might be
mistaken as to the actual conditions; that the legislative department — the
Philippine Commission — might, by resolution, declare after investigation, that
a state of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion exists, and that the public
safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
when, as a matter of fact, no such Conditions actually existed; that the
President, or Governor-General acting upon the authority of the Philippine
Commission, might by proclamation suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus without there actually existing the conditions mentioned in the act of
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the applicants
allege in their argument in support of their application for the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>, that the legislative and executive branches of the Government might
reach a wrong conclusion from their investigations of the actual conditions, or
might, through a desire to oppress and harass the people, declare that a state
of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion existed and that public safety required
the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus when actually and
in fact no such conditions did exist. We can not assume that the legislative
and executive branches will act or take any action based upon such motives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, it can not be assumed that the legislative and
executive branches of the Government, with all the machinery which those
branches have at their command for examining into the conditions in any part of
the Archipelago, will fail to obtain all existing information concerning actual
conditions. It is the duty of the executive branch of the Government to
constantly inform the legislative branch of the Government of the condition of
the Union as to the prevalence of peace or disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The executive branch of the Government,
through its numerous branches of the civil and military, ramifies every portion
of the Archipelago, and is enabled thereby to obtain information from every
quarter and corner of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can the
judicial department of the Government, with its very limited machinery for the
purpose of investigating general conditions, be any more, sure of ascertaining
the true conditions, throughout the Archipelago, or in any particular district,
than the other branches of the Government?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We think not."</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">C. THE CONCLUSION</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of the question of validity of Proclamation No.
1081 and all acts done under it, by delving into the sufficiency of the grounds
on which the declaration of martial law is premised, involves a political
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there is
constitutional basis for the President's action is for him to decide
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I take it for a fact that he is
not an irresponsible man and will act reasonably and wisely, and not
arbitrarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No President in his right
mind will proclaim martial law without any basis at all but merely to fight the
hobgoblins and monsters of his own imagination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the exercise of that power this Court should not interfere or take
part in any manner, shape or form, as it did in the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this Court required the Army
officers, who furnished the President with the facts on which he acted, to
present proofs to establish the basis of the habeas corpus suspension, this
Court practically superimposed itself on the executive by inquiring into the
existence of the facts to support his action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">This,</span> is indeed unfortunate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To inquire is to know the facts as basis of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To inquire is to decide, and to
decide includes the power to topple down or destroy what has been done or
erected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the ultimate effect of
the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the security and existence of the state is jeopardized by
sophisticated, clandestine and overseas means of destruction and subversion;
when open avowals of attempts to dismember the Philippines are politically and
financially encouraged and supported by foreign powers; when the advocates of a
sinister political and social ideology are openly storming even the bastions of
military power and strength with the use of smuggled arms furnished by those
who wish this nation ill, let us leave to the Executive the unhampered
determination of the occasion for the exercise of his power, as well as the
choice of the weapons for safeguarding the nation. This Court should not, by a
process of subtle reasoning and rhetorical display of legal erudition, stand on
the way to effective action by virtually crippling him. Instead, it should be a
rock of refuge and strength for those who are called upon to do battle against
the forces of devastating iconoclasm and ruthless vandalism that ruled our
streets, our public squares and our schools before the establishment of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of imposing cramping
restrictions on the executive and thereby giving the enemy aid and comfort,
this Court should allow the political department <span class="GramE">a full</span>
and wide latitude of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that all orders, decrees or acts of the President
under the Martial Law Proclamation, including those of the respondent Secretary
of National Defense as his authorized representative, are valid and
binding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people have ratified those
acts by the adoption and ratification of the New Constitution as proclaimed by
the President on January 17, 1973, and by the Referendum held on July 27-28,
1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For us to declare them valid in
our decision now has become merely an anti-climax after we have decided in the <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> case that the people have ratified and accepted
the New Constitution and there remains no more judicial obstacle to its
enforcement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the arrest and detention of the petitioners,
including their further detention after the ratification and acceptance of the
New Constitution, and even up to the present, are valid and constitutional. The
duration of their detention, especially as regards petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of
the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr., his
detention is no longer open to question as formal charges of subversion, murder
and illegal possession of firearms have been filed against him with the proper
Military Commission.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">D. THE JUDGMENT</p>

<p class="BODY">By this separate opinion I might incur the displeasure of my
senior brethren who conceived and labored in bringing forth the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> decision which I am openly advocating to be
discarded because this Court practically interfered with the exercise of a
purely executive power under the guise of inquiring into the constitutional
sufficiency of the factual bases of the habeas corpus proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By requiring the <span class="GramE">representatives</span>
.of the President to present evidence to show the reasonable exercise of his
power, I repeat that this Court trenched upon a constitutionally granted power
of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In expressing my
honest thoughts on a matter that I believe is of supreme importance to the
safety and security of the nation, I did so unmindful of the possible
condemnation of my colleagues and fearless of the judgment of history.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, I vote to dismiss all petitions.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDEZ, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">PROLOGUE</p>

<p class="BODY">I have decided to write this Separate Opinion even before the
main opinion has been written, for no other cases in the history of the
Republic have assumed such transcendental importance as the cases which directly
arose out of the proclamation of martial law on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No other cases presented before this Court have aroused such widespread
attention, speculation, controversy, and concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the language of one of the
petitioners, "the decision in these case(s), whatever it may be, will be
cited in history books many, many years from now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it will be quoted wherever lovers of
freedom ask the question — What did the Court do in that difficult hour?"</p>

<p class="BODY">Our decision in the various petitions now before this Tribunal
like Our decision in the Ratification Cases (L-­36142, <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>
<i>vs</i>. The Executive Secretary, et al.; L-36165, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
et al., <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, etc., et al.; L-36232, <span class="SpellE">Monteclaro</span>, et al. <i>vs</i>. The Honorable Executive
Secretary, et al.), must uphold the validity of constitutionalism in our
country and our steadfast adherence to the Rule of Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision should set the pattern and the
thrust of Our continuous effort to locate that elusive boundary between
individual liberty and public order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should reconcile the claims to individual or civil rights with the equally and,
at times, even more compelling needs of community existence in a spirit of
Constitutionalism and adherence to the Rule of Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Through our New Constitution, the Delegates to the Constitutional
Convention and the voters in the ratification referendum alike have given our
government a fresh mandate and new guidelines in the charting of a truly
independent existence and the emergence of a dynamic and progressive order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now the task of this Court to
concretize and make clearly visible the connecting links between the 1935
Constitution and the 1973 Constitution, and to consider the constitutionality
of the martial law proclamation (No. 1081) now being vehemently challenged in
these cases -- its constitutionality as initially proclaimed under the old
Constitution, and the constitutionality of its continuation which now falls
under the present Charter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also the function of this Tribunal to help give flesh and
substance to our people's aspirations for secure and self-sufficient if not
abundant existence even as justice, peace, liberty, and equality are guaranteed
and assured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must strike the correct
balance, given specific times and circumstances, between the demands of public
or social order and equally insistent claims of individual liberty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised regarding the force and <span class="SpellE">effectivit<span style="">y</span></span> of the 1973 Constitution have
been thoroughly discussed <span style="">in </span>other
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should now be a settled
matter but have been raised anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
were discussed at length in the earlier stages of the instant petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mass of pleadings and lengthy oral
arguments dwelt not only on the validity of Proclamation No. 1081 and the
legality of the arrest and detention of the petitioners but also on the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new Constitution and other related
matters as right to counsel, jurisdiction of military tribunals, applications
for amnesty, visits of relatives, conditions inside the detention camp right to
withdraw the petition, and the like.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is necessary to sift the basic issues from all secondary and
incidental matters, we must also touch on important related issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is imperative to declare what the
Constitution commands is the law on these issues.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>The average citizen, as a rule, is not very interested in the
detailed intricacies surrounding the resolution of constitutional
questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He usually has strong views
on the final outcome of constitutional litigation but rarely bothers to inquire
into the <span class="SpellE">labyrinthian</span> facets of the case or the
detailed reasoning which usually supports the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>It is not so with regard to these habeas corpus cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explosive potentialities of Our ruling
are known to everybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The country
awaits Our decision with keen expectations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The grounds supporting the decision are a matter of public concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The implications of these cases have been
speculated upon, although sometimes with limited comprehension and noticeable
lack of fairness, even in foreign countries.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>It, therefore, behooves the members of this Tribunal to render
their opinions, as much as possible, in terms and in a presentation that can be
understood by the people.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> and Co., Inc. vs.
Land Tenure Administration</i>, (31 SCRA 413, 423) this Tribunal stated that
"as the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer's document, it being
essential for the rule of law to obtain that it should ever be present in the
people's consciousness, its language as much as possible should be understood
in the sense they have in common use."</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>In this case, We should go one step further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We should not limit Ourselves to looking at
the words of the Constitution as ordinary and simple language but Our reasoning
in the decision itself should be frank and explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our task is not a mere matter of
constitutional construction and interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Through its decision, this Court should also speak directly to the
average layman, to the common people.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">THE MARTIAL LAW PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1972</st1:date>
the President announced that, on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September
 21, 1972</st1:date> or two days earlier, he had, pursuant to Proclamation No.
1081, declared a state of martial law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President cited and detailed many acts of
insurrection and rebellion against the government of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
committed by lawless elements and various front organizations in order to seize
political and state power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proclamation
No. 1081 concludes —</p>

<blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the
Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested upon me by Article VII, Section 10,
paragraph (2) of the Constitution, do hereby place the entire Philippines as
defined in Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law and, in
my capacity as their commander-in-chief, do hereby command the armed forces of
the Philippines, to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines, prevent
or suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as any act of insurrection or
rebellion and to enforce obedience to all the laws and decrees, orders and
regulations promulgated by me personally or upon my direction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition, I do hereby order that all persons presently detained,
as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly detained for the crimes
committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident thereto, or in
connection therewith, for crimes against public order, crimes involving
usurpation of authority, rank, title and improper use of names, uniforms, and
insignia, crimes committed by public officer, and for such other crimes as will
be enumerated in Orders that I shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes
as a consequence of any violation of any decree, order or regulation
promulgated by me personally or promulgated upon my direction shall be kept
under detention until otherwise ordered released by me or by my duly designated
representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">ARREST OF THE PETITIONERS</p>

<p class="BODY">Under a state of martial law, petitioners or the persons in whose
behalf petitions for writs of <i>habeas corpus</i> have been filed were on
various dates arrested and detained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
orders of arrest were premised on General Order No. 2 of the President dated <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1972</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which was amended by General Order No. 2-A, on <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>General Order No. 2-A reads:</p>

<blockquote>Pursuant to Proclamation Order No. 1081, dated <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>, and in my capacity <span style="">as Commander-in-Chief of all the </span>Armed
Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hereby order you as Secretary of National
Defense to forthwith arrest or cause the arrest and take into your custody the
individuals named in the attached lists for being participants or for having
given aid and comfort in the conspiracy to seize political and state power in
the country and to take over the government by force, the extent of which has
now assumed the proportion of an actual war against our people and<span style=""> </span>our legitimate government and in order
to prevent them from further committing acts that are inimical or injurious to
our people, the government and our national interest, and to hold said
individuals until otherwise so ordered by me or by my duly designated
representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise, I do hereby order you to arrest or cause the arrest and
take into custody and to hold them until otherwise ordered released by me or by
my duly designated representative:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such persons as may have committed crimes and
offenses in furtherance or on <span style="">the
occasion </span>of or incident to or in connection with the crimes of
insurrection or rebellion as defined in Articles 134 to <span style="">138 </span>of the Revised Penal Code, and other crimes against public
order <span style="">as defined in Articles 146, 147,
148, 149, 151, 153, 154, 155, </span>and <span style="">156
</span>of the same Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such persons who may have committed crimes
against national security and the laws of the nation, as enumerated and defined
in Title I of the Revised Penal Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Arrests and detentions under a martial law proclamation are not
necessarily limited to those who have actually committed crimes and
offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, those
arrested and taken into custody under General Order No. 2-A fall under three
general groups:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Those</span>
who appear to have actually committed crimes and offenses and who should be
charged and punished for such crimes and offenses pursuant to our penal laws;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who have been arrested not to make them
account for crimes and offenses but to prevent them from committing acts
inimical or injurious to the objectives of a martial law proclamation; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who appear to have actually committed
crimes and offenses but whose prosecution <span style="">and
</span>punishment is deferred because the preventive nature of their detention <span style="">is, for the moment, more </span>important <span style="">than their punishment for </span>violating <span style="">the laws </span>of the land.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Criminal charges have been filed against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr., and he
therefore, may fall under Group No. 1 and the "preventive" aspect of
Group No. 3. It is true that he questions the validity of the charges, raises
as an issue the deprivation of fundamental rights of an accused, and challenges
the jurisdiction of a military commission to try him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, determination of these questions is
properly for another proceeding and another decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of these <i>habeas corpus</i>
petitions, he and many others similarly situated may fall under Groups 1 and <span style="">3.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> can fall
under Group 2 and Group No. 3, as far as the record indicates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there may be persons arrested pursuant
to General Order No. <span style="">2 </span>who may
fall under the second group but against whom charges could be filed as under
the third group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have not been
charged for reasons obviously related to national security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administration may have determined that,
in the light of the martial law situation, it is neither wise nor expedient to
file such charges now.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutionality of the arrest of those arrested under Group
No 1 cannot be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have
committed a crime and therefore can be ordered arrested and detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutionality of the arrest of those arrested under Group
Nos. <span style="">2 </span>and <span style="">3, </span>under martial law finds support in
the book of Justice Fernando and Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>; the
pertinent part of said book reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>Once martial law has been declared, arrest may be necessary not
so much for punishment</i> but by way of precaution to stop disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as <span style="">such arrest </span>are made in good faith and in the honest belief they
are needed to maintain order, the President, as Commander-in-Chief, cannot
thereafter after he <span style="">is out of office,
be </span>subjected to an action on <span style="">the
ground that he </span>had no reasonable ground <span style="">for his belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it </span>comes
to a decision by the head of the <span style="">State </span>upon
a matter involving <span style="">its life, the
ordinary </span>rights of individual, <span style="">must
yield to what he </span>deems the necessities of <span style="">the moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public danger
warrants the substitution of executive </span>process. This is <span style="">admitted with </span>regard to <span style="">killing </span>men in the <span style="">actual clash of arms and the same is true of
temporary detention to </span>prevent apprehended harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good faith and honest belief is the necessity
of the detention to <span style="">maintain order </span>thus
furnishes a good defense to any claim for liability. (<span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>
and Fernando, <i>Constitution of the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i>Philippines</i></st1:place></st1:country-region>.

<p class="BODY">For instance, in G.R. No. L-35539, Carmen I. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
<span style="">pressed </span>for the urgent and
immediate release of Senator J<span style="">ose </span>W.
<span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> from the custody of either the respondents,
their agents, instruments, auxiliaries or servants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that the respondents unlawfully
or illegally and without any valid authority whatsoever, in violation of the
petitioner's rights as a citizen of the Republic, seized his person from his
residence and moved him to a place of confinement and detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition also alleges that no charges
have been filed against Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> for committing
or having committed insurrection or rebellion or subversion and that the
memorandum directing his arrest is neither an order of arrest nor a warrant of
arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in G.R. No. L-35546 alleges that petitioners <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr., Ramon V. <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, Jr., Francisco S. Rodrigo, and Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> have been illegally detained and unlawfully deprived
of their personal liberty beyond the period authorized by law without any
formal complaint for any specific offense having been instituted against them
before our courts of law and without any judicial writ or order, having been
issued authorizing their confinement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is alleged that the petitioners have not committed any crime nor violated any
law, rule or regulation whether individually or in collaboration with other
person or persons for which they may be detained and deprived of their personal
liberty without any formal charge or judicial warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">A common allegation in the various petitions challenges the
validity of Presidential Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is asserted that Proclamation No. 1081 declaring martial law is
illegal and unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void because the
conditions under which martial law may be declared by the President do not
exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition in G.R. No. L-35546
states that assuming <span class="SpellE"><i>argumenti</i></span><i> gratis</i>
that the conditions for the valid exercise of the extraordinary power to
declare martial law exist, Proclamation No. 1081 and Presidential Decrees and
Orders issued pursuant thereto are unconstitutional and illegal in extent and
scope because they deprive the Supreme Court of its constitutional power and
authority to determine the constitutionality, legality and validity of the
decrees, orders, rules and regulations issued pursuant to the
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that the
proclamation is unconstitutional and illegal because it divests and ousts the
civil courts throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the jurisdiction to decide and punish certain offenses under the existing
laws of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition
emphasizes that civil courts continue to remain open and have in fact never
ceased to function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>petition challenges the validity <span style="">of </span>Proclamation No. 1081 because it
grants to the President powers which are otherwise vested by the Constitution
in other departments of the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Corollary to the above allegations G.R. No. L-35546, is the
allegation of petitioners Veronica L. <span class="SpellE">Yuyitung</span> and
Tan Chin <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> in G.R. No. L-35556 that assuming
without admitting the validity of Proclamation No. 1081, the issuance of such a
proclamation is not a valid justification to arrest any person whimsically or
arbitrarily or without the necessary basis or foundation inherent in proper
arrest or detention.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in G.R. No. 35547 alleges that petitioner E.
Voltaire Garcia II has not committed the crimes of insurrection, rebellion or
subversion nor any crime similar thereto nor any crime at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It states that his continued illegal
detention prevents him from performing his function as member of the
Constitutional Convention and, therefore, deprives his district of
representation which is obviously against public policy and public
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition asks the Supreme
Court to take judicial notice of the fact that there was no invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion or imminent danger thereof before and/or after the
date of Proclamation No. 1081 that may require for the public safety the placing
of any part of the country under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reiterating the allegations in the other petitions, it outlines how,
throughout the length and breadth of the country especially in the Greater
Manila area, all, executive offices are functioning in complete normalcy; how
all courts from the lowest municipal courts to the Supreme Court are in full
operation; and how the different legislative bodies from barrio councils up to
Congress are likewise functioning smoothly according to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Rondon</span> in G.R. No. <span style="">L-35573 </span>alleges that pursuant to
Proclamation <span style="">No. </span>1081 the
President issued General Order. No. 3 which creates military tribunals to take
jurisdiction over certain acts and crimes to the exclusion of civil
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition, alleges that the
creation of such military tribunals and the vesting thereof with judicial
functions are null and void because civil courts are<span style="">,</span> open and functionin<span style="">g</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It questions the intent to try the petitioner
before the military tribunals for any crime which the respondents may impute to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner alleges that he has
not engaged in any of the criminal activities defined in Proclamation No. <span style="">1081, that, at best, </span>he is only a <span style="">critic of</span> the policies of the
Government and, at worst, a civilian citizen amenable to the processes of
civilian law, if at all he has committed any offense.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(b) <i>Present Status of
Petitioners</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>things now
stand, the different petitioners may be divided into four <span style="">(4) </span>groups:</p>

<blockquote>1. Some petitioners like Veronica L. <span class="SpellE">Yuvitung</span>,
Tan Chin <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bren</span> <span class="SpellE">Guiao</span>, Hernando J. <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>, Ernesto
Granada, Luis Beltran, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Cusipag</span> and Willie <span class="SpellE">Baun</span> have already been released from custody of the
respondents and are no longer under detention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These petitioners earlier filed motions to withdraw their cases and the
Court readily approved the withdrawal of the petitions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Some petitioners like Joaquin V. <span class="SpellE">Roces</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, Sr.
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Fadul</span>, Rosalind <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
Go Eng Guan, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Soliven</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>, Luis R.
Mauricio, Juan L. Mercado, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span> and Manuel
<span class="SpellE">Almario</span> have likewise been released from respondents
custody and are also no longer detained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, after an initial period of silence following their release, the
petitioners have manifested that they have only been conditionally released
subject to various conditions and continuing restrictions thus implying they
expect a decision on their petitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Francisco S. Rodrigo has also filed a manifestation stating
that while he was released from detention at Fort <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, on December 5, 1972, his release was
conditional and subject to certain restrictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His manifestation was filed for the purpose
of showing that insofar as he is concerned, his petition for habeas corpus is not
moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Francisco
S. Rodrigo is, therefore, asking this Court to render a decision on his
petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. On the other hand, petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
was under detention until very recently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For reasons which will be discussed later, he has, however, asked for
and insisted upon the withdrawal of his petition in spite of the fact that he
is under detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before this opinion
could be promulgated, however, he has been ordered released by the President on
the occasion of His Excellency's birthday, <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date>, together with some other detainees
under martial law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. is still under detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Charges have been filed before a military
commission for various crimes and offenses but the petitioner challenges the
jurisdiction of military courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
not filed any motion to withdraw his petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Based on his pleadings and his challenge to the jurisdiction of military
tribunals, the petitioner states that it is incumbent upon this Court to rule
upon the merits of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
wants information filed before civilian courts and invokes constitutional
rights to free him from military detention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
Jr., is insistent that this Court render a decision on his petition for a writ
of habeas corpus.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">ANSWER OF RESPONDENTS:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>THE ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of the respondents states that on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September <span style="">21, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in the exercise of powers vested in him by Article VII, Section <span style="">10, paragraph 2 </span>of the Constitution,
issued Proclamation No. 1081 placing the entire <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the acts
questioned by the petitioners are justified by orders and instructions of the
President issued pursuant to the proclamation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main question that confronts the Tribunal
is therefore, the validity of Proclamation No.1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is tainted with unconstitutionality,
then all the acts taken pursuant to the proclamation are void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will then follow that the arrest and
detentions of the petitioners are void.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, if the proclamation of martial law is
sustained, we still have to determine its scope and effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must answer these questions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May we inquire into the validity of its
continuation? Is a suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
automatically included in a proclamation of martial law?</p>

<p class="BODY">Other questions also arise which, however, need be decided by Us
only in a general manner in the present cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>May the Commander-in-Chief issue orders with the force and effect of
legislation? May such legislation cover subjects which are not directly related
to the conquest of the particular crisis?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, does the proclamation of martial law give the President
authority to pass legislation not directly related to invasion, insurrection,
rebellion, or imminent danger thereof?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If civilian courts are open and functioning, may the President issue
decrees and orders which transfer some of the jurisdiction to military
tribunals?</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidental issues have also been raised in the light of the main
issue of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is no longer
before this Court but may be mentioned in passing. The 1973 Constitution
increased the composition of the Court from eleven (11) to fifteen (15).<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>At
<span style="">a </span>time when there were only nine
(9) members carried over from the old Court, may these nine members — the
Acting Chief Justice and eight members — validly hear a constitutional
issue?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is there a quorum under Article
X. Section 2 (2)? which reads:</p>

<blockquote>[2]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All cases involving the
constitutionality of a treaty, executive agreement, or law shall be heard and
decided by the Supreme Court <i>en banc</i>, and no treaty, executive
agreement, or law may be declared unconstitutional without the concurrence of
at least ten Members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other cases
which under its rules are required to be heard <i>en banc</i> shall be decided
with the concurrence of at least eight members.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We now have a Chief Justice and eleven members so the problem of
a quorum is solved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another incidental issue is the power of this Court to inquire
into the conditions of detention of petitioners. And still another issue is
whether one of the petitioners may, at a time when a decision is ready to be
promulgated, withdraw his petition and avoid a decision on the issues he has
raised.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VI</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">ON PETITIONER DIOKNO'S MOTION TO WITHDRAW</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue to resolve is an incidental but important
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also the most recent.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(a) <i>Arguments Pro and
Con</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Motion to Withdraw dated <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="12">December 29,1973</st1:date>, petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
asked leave of court to withdraw the petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> filed in
his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked for the withdrawal
of the main petition other pleadings filed in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given for the withdrawal was
"First, though I am convinced beyond any nagging doubt that we are on the
side of right and reason, law and justice, I am equally convinced that we
cannot reasonably expect either right or reason, law or justice to prevail in
my case ... (and) Second, in view of the new oath that its members have taken
the present Supreme Court is a new Court functioning under a new Constitution,
different from the Court under which I applied for my release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was willing to be judged by the old Court
under the old Constitution but not by the new Court under new Constitution
because as Albert <span class="SpellE">Camus</span>' judge penitent said in the
novel 'The Fall':<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'he who clings to a
law does not fear the judgment that puts him in his place within an order he
believes in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the keenest of human
torments is to be judged without law."</p>

<p class="BODY">On being required to comment on the petitioner's motion to
withdraw, the Solicitor General stated that the petitioner<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> should
not be allowed to remove his case from this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three reasons were given:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the charge is unfair to the Supreme
Court and its members; (b) that it is untrue and (c) that in the main, it is
contemptuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
disputed as unfair, the charge that justice cannot be expected from the Supreme
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out that the Supreme
Court did not inject itself into <span style="">t</span>he
controversy but it was the petitioner who invoked the Court's jurisdiction not
only in this case but the plebiscite cases as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General noted that the scorn
with which the Court is treated in the motion to withdraw stands in sharp contrast
with the praise lavished on it when petitioners began these proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that the Supreme Court was then characterized as
having the greatest credibility among the three branches of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was described as a dispenser of justice
and as the last citadel of their liberties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Memorandum, petitioner manifested and stressed the
importance of a decision — "the decision in this case, <i>whatever it may
be</i>, will be cited in history books many, many years from now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it will be quoted wherever lovers of
freedom ask the question ... What did the Court do in that difficult
hour?" (Underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner further stated in the Memorandum that "the
duty of this Court is awesome indeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
responsibility to Our people and to history is heavier and more enormous than
words and phrases can possibly describe."</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast to this insistence on a decision, a portion of the
motion to withdraw cited by the respondents may be repeated:</p>

<blockquote>(I)t seems to me that our people have the right to expect members
of the highest court of the land to display a conscience more sensitive, a
sense of mental honesty more consistent than those generally displayed in the
market place. And it has pained me to note that, in swearing to support the new
'Constitution', the five members of the Court who had held that it had not been
validly ratified, have not fulfilled our expectations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not blame them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not know what I would have done in their
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, at the same time, I cannot
continue to entrust my case to them; and I have become thoroughly convinced
that our quest for justice in my case is futile. (p. 6).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Issue was also taken by the respondents with the petitioner's
charge that despite the finding of a majority that the new Constitution had not
been validly ratified, the Court nonetheless dismissed the petitions seeking to
stop the enforcement of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The allegation that the justices of this Court took an oath to support
the Constitution because they had been allowed to continu<span style="">e</span> in office was challenged as false by
the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third ground for the respondents' opposition to the motion to
withdraw is the allegedly contemptuous nature of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Comment states that attacks on the Court
are most serious; none of those made in the past has put the court's integrity
and capacity for justice in serious question as much as the petitioner's motion
to withdraw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the Solicitor
General, the charge in the case at bar goes to the very foundation of our
system of justice and the respect that is due to it, that it is subversive of
public confidence in the impartiality and independence of courts and tends to
embarrass the administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General manifested that "we cannot shape the world of
the Supreme Court as we want to see it and, later seeing the world of reality,
lash at the Supreme Court for betraying our illusions."</p>

<p class="BODY">In succeeding pleadings, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
pressed his motion to withdraw with even greater vigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for petitioners stated that the
so-called charge "unfair to the Court and its members, untrue, and
contemptuous" — was never made at all and that the Solicitor General was
putting up a <span class="SpellE">strawman</span> and proceeding to demolish it.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a forty-six (46) page Reply, he pointed out that the factual bases
for deciding to withdraw the case have not been specifically denied, as indeed
they are undeniable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted,
however, that the cited factual bases go into the very merits of the petition
for the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>:</p>

<blockquote>(1) On the question of the validity of ratification, six (6)
members of the Court held that the proposed Constitution was not validly
ratified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) On the question of acquiescence by the Filipino people, only <span style="">a </span>minority of four (4) justices held
there was acquiescence, two (2) holding that there was no acquiescence, and
four (4) holding they had no means of knowing to the point of judicial
certainty, whether the people have accepted the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) The Court did not rule that the "new Constitution"
was in effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) The ratification cases were nevertheless dismissed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner added "undeniable facts":</p>

<blockquote>(1) The petition for habeas corpus was filed <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1972</st1:date> while the ratification cases
were filed January 20 and 23, 1973.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) From the filing of the petition to the date petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> asked his
counsel to withdraw the case, 460 days had elapsed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) On the date the reply was filed, 531 days had elapsed without
charges being filed or trial and conviction for any offense being held.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) All the members of the old Court, who had taken an oath to
"preserve and defend" the 1935 Constitution, took an oath on <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1973</st1:date> to defend the
"new Constitution".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In disputing the Solicitor General's charge that the Supreme
Court is treated with scorn in the Motion to Withdraw, the petitioner stated
that the tone of the motion may be one of dismay or frustration but certainly
not of scorn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner called the
charge gratuitous and totally bare of foundation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also pointed out that there could be no contempt
of court in the motion to withdraw because the factual bases of his letter are
indisputable and the motion comes under the protection of the constitutional
right to a fair hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invoked his
right to free expression as a litigant and stressed that a citizen of the
Republic may express himself thoughtfully sincerely and reputably without fear
of reprisal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner also pointed
out that both principle and precedent justify grant of the motion to withdraw.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(b) <i>My original
stand:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Motion should be denied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reasons:</i></p>

<p class="BODY">My present stand:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view
of the release of <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> before this opinion could be
promulgated, I now vote to grant his motion to withdraw his petition the same
having become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, I would like to discuss the merits of the motion if only to
establish guidelines for similar cases that may arise in the future.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, the right of the plaintiff to dismiss his
action with the consent of the Court is universally recognized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the plaintiff believes that the action he
has commenced in order to enforce a right or to rectify a wrong is no longer
necessary or he later discovers that the right no longer exists, he should be
allowed to withdraw his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If in the
course of litigation, he finds out that the course of the action shall be
different from that he had intended, the general rule is that he should be
permitted to withdraw the same, subject to the approval of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff should not be required to continue the action when
it is not to his advantage to do so. Litigation should be discouraged and not
encouraged. Courts should not allow parties to litigate when they no longer
desire to litigate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that the Rules of Court do not allow
automatic approval of the plaintiff’s motion to dismiss after service of the
answer or of a motion for summary judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Rule 17,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> once the
issues are joined, an action can be dismissed upon the plaintiff's instance
only upon order of the Court and upon such terms and conditions as the Court
deems proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement in the Rules that dismissal is discretionary upon
the Court is not without significance. In fact, the petitioner does not deny
the authority of the Court to reject his motion as long as there are reasons
for such rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is simply arguing
that there is no valid reason to deny the motion thus implying that a denial
would, in effect, be an abuse in the exercise of a discretionary power.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Court's deliberations, the view was advanced that
petitioner's motion for withdrawal made his confinement voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I disagreed, for said motion, in the light of
the other pleadings and memoranda submitted by him, can still be considered as
a protest against his confinement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, petitioner has not made any statement upon which we can base a
conclusion that he is agreeing voluntarily to his continued confinement and
thereby making his case moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">I submit there can be no debate over the principle that the right
to withdraw a petition at this stage is not an absolute right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What faces this Court is not its power to
grant or deny the motion but whether there are sound reasons why the motion to
withdraw should be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there are
no sound reasons, the motion should be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioner, there are only two instances when a
Court may validly deny such <span style="">w</span>ithdrawal
—</p>

<blockquote>(1) When the withdrawal would irreparably injure other parties to
the case such as, for example, in class results, in probate proceedings, or in
ordinary civil actions <span style="">when </span>the
adverse party has pleaded <span style="">a </span>counterclaim
that cannot be decided without first deciding the main case; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) When the withdrawal would irreparably injure the public
interest by depriving the Court of the opportunity to prevent or to correct a
serious violation of the Constitution or of the laws.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I am not prepared to accept the proposition or to render an
abstract opinion that there are indeed only two such exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The infinite number of factual situations
that can come before this Court could conceivably add one or two or even more
exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be imprudent or precipitate to make such a categorical
assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for the release
of <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, I would have pressed on my firm belief
that the importance of this case and the issues raised by the petitioner call
for denial of the motion to withdraw.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The points ably raised by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
P. Mendoza and Assistant Solicitor General Vicente V. Mendoza, who have shown
remarkably splendid performance in shouldering almost entirely the government's
defense, against some of the country's most distinguished lawyers, notably
former Senator Lorenzo M. <span class="SpellE">Tanada</span> and a battery of
other lawyers whose names are a veritable list of "Who is Who" in the
legal profession, can be condensed into only one argument —the petitioners have
brought before this Court a case of such transcendental importance that it
becomes a duty to our legal institutions, to our people, and to posterity to
decide it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must not leave the
resolution of such grave issues to a future day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, among the present <i>habeas corpus</i> cases now
before this Court, the best forum for Our decision would have been the <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> case for, before his release, he was the only
petitioner who was actually detained but without charges, while there are

<p class="BODY">The petitioner seeks to distinguish his case from <span class="SpellE"><i>Krivenko</i></span><i> vs. Register of Deeds</i>, 79 Phil.
461.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, this Court ruled --</p>

<blockquote>According to Rule 52, section 4, of the Rules of Court, it is
discretionary upon this Court to grant a withdrawal of appeal after the briefs
have been presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the
motion for withdrawal was filed in this case, not only had the briefs been
presented, but the case had already been voted and the majority decision was
being prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
withdrawal stated no reason whatsoever, and the Solicitor General was agreeable
to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the motion was pending in
this Court, came the new circular of the Department of Justice instructing all
register of deeds to accept for registration all transfers of residential lots
to aliens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was naturally one of the registers of deeds to
obey the new circular, as against his own stand in this case which had been
maintained by the trial court and firmly defended in this Court by the
Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we grant the
withdrawal, the result would be that petitioner-appellant Alexander A. <span class="SpellE">Krivenko</span> wins his case, not by a decision of this Court but
by the decision or circular of the Department of Justice, issued while this
case was pending before this Court. Whether or not this is the reason why
appellant seeks the withdrawal of his appeal and why the Solicitor General
readily agrees to that withdrawal is now immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is material and indeed very important,
is whether or not we should allow interference with the regular and complete
exercise by this Court of its constitutional functions, and whether or not
after having held long deliberations and after having reached a clear and
positive conviction as to what the constitutional mandate is, we may still
allow our conviction to be silenced, and the constitutional mandate to be
ignored or misconceived, with all the harmful consequences that might be
brought upon the national patrimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
it is but natural that the new circular be taken full advantage of by many with
the circumstance that perhaps the constitutional question may never come up
again before this court, because both vendors and the vendees will have no
interest but to uphold the validity of their transactions, and very unlikely
will the register of deeds venture to disobey the orders of their
superior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the possibility for this
court to voice its conviction in a future case may be remote, with the result
that our indifference of today might signify a permanent offense to the Constitution.

<p class="BODY">There are indeed certain differences between the<span style=""> </span>facts of the <span class="SpellE"><i>Krivenko</i></span>

</span>If the factual situations were completely similar, former Senator

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I cannot, however, </span>agree
with counsel <span class="SpellE">Tanada</span> that the deviations from the <span class="SpellE">Krivenko</span> facts call for a different ruling in the instance
petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has
grappled at length and in depth validity of the proclamation of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has closely examined the
resultant curtailments of such liberties as the right to a writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> or to freedom of expression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When it is on the verge of issuing a decision it is suddenly asked to
drop the case and the issues raised simply because the petitioner is no longer
interested in the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind,
a granting of the motion would be <span class="SpellE">recreancy</span> and
unfaithfulness to the Court's sworn duties and obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in the <span class="SpellE"><i>Krivenko</i></span> case, the
reasons for the withdrawal are no longer significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the non-silencing of this Court on
issues of utmost public importance which really matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> is alone in seeking withdrawal at the stage of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that a decision could
possibly still be rendered on remaining cases is, however, no justification to
grant the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue is whether
one or two or all of the petitioners may ask for a withdrawal of his or their
petitions and hope to bring about a non-decision on the issues because of the
rendering moot and academic of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My answer is categorically in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even if the case is mooted at this
stage by the release of the petitioners, I would still vote for a decision on
the questions raised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>This may be a simple motion for withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, I see no difference in the need to

interpret the meaning of the constitutional provision in spite of urgings that
it should refrain from doing so.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1937, this Court, speaking through justice Laurel in

and inasmuch as Act No. 2972 is a new law not yet interpreted by the courts, in
the interest of the public welfare and for the advancement of public policy, we
have determined to overrule the defense of want of jurisdiction in order that
we may decide the main issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
here an extraordinary situation which calls for a relaxation of the general
rule." Our ruling on this point was sustained by the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Avelino</i></span><i> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span></i> (83 Phil. 17), the Supreme Court had very sound
reasons to resolve on March 4, 1949 not to decide whether or not Senator <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> had validly been elected Senate President. The Court
ruled that the subject matter of the <i>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></i>
proceeding to declare the petitioner the rightful President of the Philippine
Senate and to oust the respondent was not a matter for the Supreme Court in
view of the separation of powers doctrine, the political nature of the
controversy, and the constitutional grant <span style="">to
</span>the Senate of the power to elect its own President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to elect its President should not
be interfered with nor taken over by the judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1949" day="14" month="3">March 14, <span style="">1949</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>or only ten (10) days later, the

insisted on its earlier stand that it should render no decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Election of the Senate President was still a
matter which only the Senate should decide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, in the light of subsequent events which justified its
intervention, partly for the reasons stated in the <st1:date year="1949" day="4" month="3">March <span style="">4, 1949</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>resolution of the Court; and partly
because of the grounds stated in the various individual opinions. The Court was
constrained to declare positively that there was a quorum in the session where <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> was elected Acting Senate President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court decided to reverse a categorical
position taken only ten (10) days earlier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear from the circumstances of the case <span style="">that </span>the Court was impelled by strong policy considerations to
make a definite pronouncement in the case in order to conform to substantial
justice and comply with the requirements of public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by Justice Perfecto in his
concurring opinion. "This case raises vital constitutional questions which
no one can settle or decide if this Court should refuse to decide them."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Gonzales </i><i><span style="">vs.

SCRA 835, 853), </span>the words of Justice Laurel were recalled in order to
overcome objections to an extended decision on a case which had become moot and
academic.</p>

<blockquote>"In the course of the deliberations, a serious procedural
objection was raised by five members of the Court (Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Justices Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.) It
is their view that respondent Commission on Elections not being sought to be
restrained from performing any specific act, this suit cannot be characterized
as other than a mere request for an advisory opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a view, from the remedial law
standpoint, has much to recommend it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, a majority would affirm the original stand that under the
circumstances, it could still rightfully be treated as a petition for
prohibition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The language of Justice Laurel fits the case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'All await the decision of this Court on the

us, the paramount public interest, and the undeniable necessity for a ruling,
the national elections being barely six months away, reinforce our stand.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>De la <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Enage</span></i> <span style="">(41 SCRA,

strong policy considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition
to reduce the P1,195,200.00 bail imposed by the trial court had become moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner had escaped

could no longer grant any relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It,
however, decided the case "to set forth anew the controlling and

bail sought in order that full respect be accorded to such a constitutional
right:" (at page 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Education,

<p class="BODY">I would like to reiterate, however, that in view of the fact that

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">COURT'S DUTY TO DECIDE ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES — ON THE
PETITIONS OF THE PETITIONERS</p>

<p class="BODY">But as already stated under the topic IV (b) "Present Status
of the Petitioners", many of them, notably <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
and Rodrigo, still insist on <span style="">a d</span>ecision.
This we must now do, for the resolution of the controversy in favor of the

Court declare in a manner that cannot be misunderstood what the Constitution
commands and what the Constitution requires.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the Court should not formulate a rule of
constitutional law broader than is required by precise facts to which it is
applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that a decision on a
question of a constitutional nature should only be as broad and detailed as is
necessary to decide it.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are, therefore, those who would limit <span style="">a </span>decision solely on the Transitory
Provisions of the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
exercise of martial law powers under Article VII, Section 10, paragraph 2 of

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VIII</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">THE THREE PRINCIPAL ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General stated <span style="">the </span>respondents' position as a narrow one — whether the arrest
and detention of the petitioners were legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that <i>habeas corpus</i> is intended for cases of
illegal confinement or detention by which a person is deprived of his liberty
(Section 1, Rule 102, Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its essential object is to inquire into all manner of involuntary
restraint and to relieve a person <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, if such
restraint is illegal (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Lukban</span>, <span style="">39 </span>Phil. <span style="">778; </span><span class="SpellE">Culauag</span> <i>vs</i>. Director of Prisons, 17 SCRA <span style="">429) </span>While the issue may be presented
in seemingly narrow terms, its scope and implications are not that simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents argue that this Court is
precluded <span style="">by </span>the Constitution
from inquiring into the legality of the detentions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argue that such an inquiry is possible
only where the privilege of the writ of <i><span style="">habeas corpus </span></i><span style="">is </span>available
and inasmuch as the privilege of the writ has been suspended by the President
upon the proclamation of martial law, it follows that We should inhibit Ourselves
from asking for the reasons why the petitioners were arrested and
detained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued t<span style="">hat </span>the Constitution <span style="">has vested the determination </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span>necessity for and legality of detentions under <span style="">martial </span>law exclusively in the
Presidency <span style="">a co</span>-<span style="">equal </span>department of government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issues, therefore, revolve <span style="">around first the </span>validity of Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, assuming <span style="">its </span>original validity, may We inquire into the validity of its
continuation? And third, has the privilege of the writ <span style="">of </span>habeas corpus also been suspended upon the proclamation of
martial law? The extent of Our inquiry into the legality <span style="">of </span>the detentions and their efforts is
dependent on the answers to the foregoing issues.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">PROCLAMATION NO. 1081; A DEVIATION FROM THE TRADITIONAL
CONCEPT OF MARTIAL LAW; ARGUMENTS ON ITS VALIDITY</p>

<p class="BODY">In Proclamation No. 1081, dated <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date>, President Ferdinand E. Marcos placed
the entire <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as defined in Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution under martial law by
virtue of the power vested in the President of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by Article VII, Section 10, par. (2) of the Constitution which reads</p>

<blockquote>“The President shall be the commander-in-chief of all armed forces
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent
or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case of invasion, insurrection, rebellion,
or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend
the privileges of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law.”</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(a) <i>What is martial
law?</i></p>

<p class="BODY">As the Solicitor General pointed out when asked to submit
definitions of martial law, there are as many definitions as there are court
rulings and writers on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
response of the petitioners gives the same impression.</p>

<p class="BODY">As good <i>definitions</i> as any that may have been made in <i>the
past</i> are the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Generally speaking, martial law or more properly, martial
rule, is the temporary government and control by military force and authority
of territory in which, by reason of the existence of war or public commotion,
the civil government is inadequate to the preservation of order and the
enforcement of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In strictness it is
not law at all, but rather <span style="">a </span>cessation
of all municipal law, as an incident of the <i>jus </i><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">belli</span></i></span><span style="">, </span>and because of paramount necessity,
and depends, for its existence, operation and extent, on the imminence of
public peril and the obligation to provide for the general safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is essentially a law or rule of force, a
purely military measure, and in the final analysis is merely the will of the
officer commanding the military forces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the off­spring of necessity, it transcends and displaces the ordinary
laws of the land, and it applies alike to military and non-military persons,
and is exercisable alike over friends and enemies, citizens and aliens."
(C.J.S. Vol. 93, pp. 115-­116, citing cases).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Martial law is the exercise of the power which resides in the
executive branch of the government to preserve order and insure the public
safety in times of emergency, when other branches of the government are unable
to function, or their functioning would itself threaten the public
safety". (Luther <i><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span>Borden, 7 <span class="SpellE">Hos</span>.

<p class="BODY">It has been held, therefore, that martial law is <span style="">a "law </span>of actual military
necessity in actual presence of <span style="">war, </span>and
is administered by the general of the army whose will it is, subject to slight
limitations." (<span class="SpellE">Constantin</span> <i>vs.</i> Smith, D.C.
Text, 57 F. 2d 239).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this same
ruling, martial law is strictly no law at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a cessation of all municipal law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In another decision, it has been held that</p>

<blockquote>"All respectable writers and publicists agree in the
definition of martial law that it is neither more nor less than the will of the
general who commands the army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
overrides and suppresses all existing civil laws, civil officers and civil
authorities, by the arbitrary exercise of military power; and every citizen or
subject, in other words, the entire population of the country, within the
confines of its power, is subjected to the mere will or caprice of the
commander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He holds the lives, liberty
and property of all in the palm of his hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Martial law is regulated by no known or established system or code of
laws, as it is over and above all of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The commander is the legislator, judge and executioner." (In
re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Egan, 8 Fed. <span class="SpellE">Cas</span>.
p. 367).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Other definitions may be cited:</p>

<blockquote>"Martial law . . . is not statutory in character and always
arises out of strict military necessity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its proclamation or establishment is not expressly authorized by any of
the provisions of the Constitution; it comes into being only in the territory
of an enemy or in a part of the territory of the United States in time of war
or in time of peace in which the proper civil authority is, for some
controlling reason, unable to exercise its proper function." (Charles
Warren, "Spies, and the Power of Congress to Subject Certain Classes of
Civilian to Trial by Military Tribunal", The American Law Review, <span class="SpellE">LIll</span> (March-April, 1919), 201-202).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The term martial law refers to the exceptional measures
adopted whether by the military or the civil authorities, in times of war or of
domestic disturbance, for the preservation of order and the maintenance of the
public authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the operation of
martial law all the inhabitants of the country or of the disturbed district,
aliens as well as citizens, are subject." (<st1:city><st1:place>Moore</st1:place></st1:city>.
Int. Law Digest II, 186.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the
subjection of aliens to Martial Law, See Moore, II, 196).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Martial law relates to the domestic territory in a condition
of insurrection or invasion, when the Constitution and its civil authorities,
state or federal as the case may be, have been rendered inoperative or
powerless by the insurrectionary or invading forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is part of our domestic or municipal
law." (<st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city> F., "The
Rationale of Martial Law", 15 ABAJ 551).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A Philippine author has tried to reconcile the many definitions.</p>

<blockquote>"Whatever the previous obscurity which has enveloped martial
law in both the British Empire and the United States, it is settled today that
martial law is (1) the exercise of military jurisdiction; (2) by the military
over the civilian population; (3) in a domestic territory; (4) on occasion of
serious public emergencies such as insurrection, rebellion invasion or imminent
danger thereof; (5) according to an unwritten law; and (6) as necessity
requires it." (Santos, Martial Law, p. 81).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The existing definitions are all based on the traditional
concepts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were made at a time when
invasions were preceded by 48-hour ultimatums followed by a formal declaration
of war, and when insurrections, and rebellions involved frontal clashes between
opposing and well-defined forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If one
group was overcome by the other, the losers would surrender their swords and
guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The winners, in turn, might
magnanimously offer to return the swords and allow the losers to retain their
side arms, rifles, and horses for home use.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, there were clear and sporting rules of the game which were
generally followed.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(b) <i>Modern Martial Law</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Martial law pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081, however, does not
completely follow the traditional forms and features which martial law has
assumed in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is modern in
concept, in the light of relevant new conditions, particularly present day
rapid means of transportation, sophisticated means of communications,
unconventional weaponry, and such advanced concepts as subversion, fifth
columns, the unwitting use of innocent persons, and the weapons of ideological warfare.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contingencies which require a state of martial law are
time-honored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are invasion,
insurrection and rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
Constitution also allows a proclamation of martial law in the face of imminent
danger from any of these three contingencies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution vests the power to declare martial law in the President
under the 1935 Constitution or the Prime Minister under the 1973
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the form, extent,
and appearance of martial law, the Constitution and, our jurisprudence are silent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Martial law pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 has, however,
deviated from the traditional picture of rigid military rule superimposed as a
result of actual and total or near total breakdown of government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Martial law was proclaimed before the normal administration of
law and order could break down. Courts of justice were still open and have
remained open throughout the state of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nationwide anarchy, overthrow of
government, and convulsive disorders which classical authors mention as essential
factors for the proclamation and continuation of <span style="">martial </span>law were not present.</p>

<p class="BODY">More important, martial law under Proclamation No. 1081 has not
resulted in the rule of the military. The will of the generals who command the
armed forces has definitely not replaced the laws of the land. It has not
superseded civilian authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead
of the rule by military officials, we have the rule of the highest civilian and
elective official of the land, assisted by civilian heads of executive
departments, civilian elective local officials and other civilian
officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial law under
Proclamation No. 1081 has made extensive use of military forces, not to take
over civilian authority but to insure that civilian authority is effective
throughout the country. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This Court can
very well note that it has summoned and continues to summon military officers
to come before it, sometimes personally and at other times through
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These military commanders have
been required to justify their acts according to our Constitution and the laws
of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These military officers are
aware that it is not their will much less their caprice but the sovereign will
of the people under a rule of law, which governs under martial law pursuant to
Proclamation No. 1081.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>It is this seemingly paradoxical nature of martial </i><i><span style="">law </span>in the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i>Philippines</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i>
that leads to the various questions raised in the instant petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also this apparently variant form and
its occasionally </i><i><span style="">divergent </span>scope
and effects which require this Court to explain just </i><i><span style="">what </span>the martial law provision of the
Constitution means.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">We must, perforce, examine the arguments of the parties on this
matter.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(c) <i>Respondents'
Arguments</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents contend that when martial law was proclaimed on September
21, 1972, the rebellion and armed action undertaken by the lawless elements of
the communist and other armed <span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span> organized
to overthrow the Republic of the Philippines by armed violence and force had
assumed the magnitude of an actual state of war against our people and the
Republic of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
declaration is found in the last "whereas" of Proclamation No. 1081.
The following assertions of the factual situation on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1972</st1:date> are also found in Proclamation
No. 1081.</p>

<blockquote>1. There is a group of lawless elements who are moved by a common
or similar ideological conviction, design, strategy, and goal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their prime purpose is to stage, undertake,
and wage an armed insurrection and rebellion against the government of the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in order to forcibly seize political and state power in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have in fact actually staged undertaken,
and waged this insurrection and rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They want to overthrow the duly constituted government and supplant our
existing political, social, economic, and legal order with an entirely new
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This new form of government, its
system of laws, its conception of God and religion, its notion of individual
rights and family relations, and its political, social economic, legal and
moral precepts are based on the Marxist, Leninist, and Maoist teachings and
beliefs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. These lawless elements have entered into a conspiracy and have
joined and banded their resources and forces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They use seemingly innocent and harmless although actually destructive
front organizations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These organizations
have been infiltrated or deliberately formed by them through sustained and
careful recruitment from among the peasantry, laborers, professionals, intellectual,
students, and mass media personnel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their membership has been strengthened and broadened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This control and influence has spread over
almost every segment and level of <span style="">our </span>society
throughout the land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The foregoing group of lawless elements enjoy the active, moral,
and material support of a foreign power to the months of May, June and July
1972, they brought into the country at <span class="SpellE">Digoyo</span> Point, <span class="SpellE">Palanan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> and other points
along the Pacific coast of Luzon, substantial quantities of war materials
consisting of around<span style=""> </span><span style="">3,500 </span>M-14 rifles, several dozens of 40
mm rocket launchers, large quantities of 80 mm rockets and ammunitions and
other combat paraphernalia</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. The lawless elements have <span style="">an
ov</span>er-all revolutionary plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
have distributed their regional program of action for 1972 to their various
field commanders and party workers. The implementation of the program of action
from the intensification of recruitment to the assassination of high government
officials and the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government in
various towns and cities has actually commenced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Various incidents of bombings, strikes,
robberies, sabotage and demonstrations are actually in implementation of the
program of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liquidation missions
aimed at ranking government officials were about to be implemented by the
fielding of so-called Sparrow Units.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. There is an equally serious disorder in <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> resulting in actual war among Christians,
Muslims, <span class="SpellE">Ilagas</span>, Barracudas, the Mindanao
Independence Movement and government troops.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Violent disorder in <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> resulted in over 3,000 casualties and more than
500,000 injured, displaced and homeless persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The economy of <st1:place>Mindanao</st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> is paralyzed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6. There is throughout the land a state of anarchy, lawless chaos,
disorder, turmoil and destruction of magnitude equivalent to an actual war
between government forces on the one hand and the New People's Army and
satellite organizations on the other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. The Supreme Court in the 1971 <i>habeas corpus</i> cases has
found that in truth and in fact there exists an actual insurrection and
rebellion in the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Portions of
the Supreme Court decision are cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was concluded by the Supreme Court that the unlawful activities of the
aforesaid elements pose a clear, present, and grave danger to public safety and
the security of the nation is also cited.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(d) <i>Petitioners'
Arguments</i></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the petitioners state that in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
"there has been no disruption at all; all government offices were
performing their usual functions; all courts were open and in the unobstructed
exercise of their jurisdiction at the time martial law was declared." The
petitioners state that we have no Civil War in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and that no province, no city, no town throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has seceded from the Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
state that there is no status of war and no status of belligerency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no armed struggle carried on between
two political bodies, each of which exercises <i>de facto</i> sovereignty over
persons within a determinate territory, and commands an army which is prepared
to observe the ordinary laws of war.</p>

<p class="BODY">On rebellion, the petitioners point out that the rebels have not
established an organized civil government nor occupied a substantial portion of
the national territory and, in fact, are described as mere "lawless
elements."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners state that "the thrust of martial law cases
is this — that for the requirement of public safety to be satisfied, civil
authority must have either fallen away or proved inadequate for the emergency,
the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal
justice according to law, and that where rebellion really exists, there is a
necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, and
as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern until the laws
can have their free course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For martial
rule can never exist where the courts are open and in the unobstructed exercise
of their jurisdiction." The petitioners cite <st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city>,
in his article, “The Rationale of Martial Law" (15 ABAJ 551).</p>

<blockquote>"Martial law relates to the domestic territory in a condition
of insurre<span style="">c</span>tion or invasion, when
the Constitution and its civil authorities … HAVE <span style="">BEEN RENDERED INOPERATIVE OR </span>POWERLESS by the insurrectionary or
invading forces."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After citing the foregoing, petitioners asked this Court to take
judicial notice of the following:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress was in session
and was in the unobstructed exercise of its functions when martial law was
proclaimed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court, the
Court of Appeals, the Courts of First Instance in the Greater Manila Area —
where petitioners had been arrested — indeed, even the municipal and city
courts were, at the time martial law was publicly announced, open and are still
open and functioning throughout the length and breadth of the land; no proof
has been shown that any court has been rendered "unable to administer
justice," due to the activities of the rebels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, it is General Order No. 3, as
amended by General Order No. 3­-A, issued pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081,
that seeks to render them powerless, in many cases, to administer justice,
according to the Constitution and the laws of the land;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitutional
Convention — the so-called "fourth branch" — had been holding its
sessions when martial law was proclaimed. Despite martial law, or probably
because of it, it decided to work with greater efficiency, it has just finished
its work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A "plebiscite" under
martial law is being called on <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="1">January
 15, 1973</st1:date>, so the people can "ratify" the proposed
Constitution;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>n the Greater Manila
Area, contrary to the speech of <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September
 <span style="">23, </span>1972</st1:date>, no
university, college, or school was closed due to the activities of the rebels;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All instruments of mass
communications were in operation up to <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="9">September
 22, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, free
speech and free press — the very heart of free inquiry and the search for truth
— became nothing but empty memories. Only the "safe newspapers and radio-<span class="SpellE">tv</span>-stations" were allowed to open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Political dissent was suppressed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>All agencies and
instrumentalities of government, national as well as local, were functioning
when martial law was proclaimed. By General Order No. <span style="">3. </span>they were ordered "to continue to function under their
present officers and employees and in accordance with existing laws .. ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petitioners state why Proclamation
No. 1081 is unconstitutional:</p>

<p class="BODY">These indisputable facts which require no introduction of proof —
because they all fall within the scope of judicial notice, under Rule 129 of
the Rules of Court — show that at the time martial law was declared there was
absolutely no justification for it, in fact and in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Proclamation No. 1081 is
unconstitutional and void, because:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is predicated on
the existence of "the magnitude of an actual war" or an "actual
status of war" that does not exist;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is allegedly based
on the "status of belligerency" which no State in the world, not even
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
has extended to the rebels or the lawless elements described in the
Proclamation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there may be
rebellion in some remote places, as in <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, there
is no justification for the declaration of martial law throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
since</blockquote>

<blockquote>a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>no large-scale,
nationwide rebellion or insurrection exists in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>public safety does not
require it, inasmuch as no department of government, no government agency or
instrumentality, and even more important, no civil court of appellate or
original jurisdiction was, at the time martial law was proclaimed, unable to
open or function, or has been, at any time since the incumbent President came
into power "rendered powerless or inoperative" due to the activities
of the rebels or the lawless elements described in the Proclamation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President himself
declared that the armed forces can handle the situation without "utilizing
the extraordinary powers of the President" (January 1, 1972), that long
before martial law was proclaimed, the Government had the "rebellion
" and the "rebels and their <span class="SpellE">supportores</span>"
under control, as the Army knew the step-by-step plot of the Communists and had
an hour-by-hour monitoring of the movements of the subversive leaders;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem in the
Greater Manila Area where petitioners were seized and arrested — was, at the
time martial law was proclaimed, plain lawlessness and criminality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the President described the situation in
his speech of <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1972</st1:date>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Lawlessness and criminality like kidnapping, smuggling, extortion,
blackmail, gun-running, hoarding and manipulation of prices, corruption in
government, tax evasion perpetrated by syndicated criminals, have increasingly
escalated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners pointed out that neither any of these or a
combination of all, constitute either the occasion or the justification for the
imposition of martial rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
since these crimes have always been with us for many years, we would never see
the end of martial law in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that since Proclamation No. 1081 is unconstitutional
and void, the General Orders, issued in pursuance thereto and by way of its
implementation, must inevitably suffer from the same congenital infirmity.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(e) <i>Authorities cited
by the Parties</i> —</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners and respondents, alike premise their arguments on the
martial law provision of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both cite decisions of foreign courts and treatises of foreign writers
expounding on martial law. And yet, completely divergent opinions on the
meaning of the provision is the result.</p>

<p class="BODY">Martial law is based on a law of necessity and is utilized as a
measure of governmental self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is, therefore, an inherent power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
needs no constitutional or statutory grant before it may be wielded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the petitioners state (Addendum, pages
80-81), it is a recognized institution in the constitutional systems of both England
and America, notwithstanding lack of express provisions on martial law in
written constitutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">We accept judicial decisions of these countries as highly
persuasive, if not as precedents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of express recognition in the constitutions or statutes of these
countries helps explain why there is disagreement on a precise definition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More important, it explains why the
necessity, scope, and extent of martial law proclamations have to be determined
by the regular courts and why the decisions are, themselves, conflicting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitutions and statutes are silent or
different from each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Courts
have been forced to go to the common law and to general principles of
Constitutional Law to look for bases of power and to resolve problems arising
out of states of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
various authorities cited by both petitioners and respondents in their
pleadings and oral arguments undoubtedly have valuable worth and applicability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are very helpful in resolving the
momentous issues raised by the petitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact remains, however, that they deal with an exercise of power
which is undefined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the United
States Supreme Court, the power is not specifically prescribed in the federal
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has led foreign
courts to naturally and logically look for the confining limits and
restrictions of ambiguous, cryptic, and perplexing boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the power is not defined, the natural
tendency is not to describe it but to look for its limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anglo-American authorities may assist but
should not control because, here, the limits are present and determined by no
less than the fundamental law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there is an ubiquitous and mandatory guide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution speaks in clear and positive terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given certain conditions, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof may be placed under martial law. To resolve the instant
petitions, it is necessary to find out what the Constitution commands and what
the express words of its positive provision mean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the Constitution that should speak on
the circumstances and qualifications of the initiation and use of an awesome
emergency power.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(b) <i>More arguments of
the Respondents:</i></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the respondents, the Constitution plainly provides
that the circumstances when martial law maybe declared, its scope and its
effects are beyond judicial examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents contend that this Court lacks jurisdiction to take
cognizance of the instant petitions for <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General has consistently
pleaded throughout these proceedings that the questions involved are political
and non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He states that the President, sworn to defend the Constitution and the
Republic, proclaimed martial law pursuant to authority expressly conferred by
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that his
decision is beyond <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> because the
Constitution has made it so and that only history and the Filipino people may
pass judgment on whether the President has correctly acted in a time of supreme
crisis.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;">(a) <i>More arguments of
the petitioner's:</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on the other hand, contend that this Tribunal is the
ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. As such, it has the power and duty to
declare Proclamation No. 1081 unconstitutional and void because the President
has exceeded his powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is argued
that where basic individual rights are involved, judicial inquiry is not
precluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the argument that martial
law is textually and exclusively committed to the President, the petitioners
answer that under the same Constitution, the President may not disable the
Court and oust them, particularly the Supreme Court of their jurisdiction to
hear cases assigned to Constitution and the laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners stress that the Court should act
now or the time will come when it can no longer act, however, much it may wish
to for it shall have completely lost then the moral force and authority it
still possesses and the valid claim it may still have of being independent,
fearless, and just.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">X</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND COURT'S JURISDICTION OVER THEM</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents' assertion that the questions raised in these
petitions are political and non-<span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> raises a
point which is easily misunderstood.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is a political question?</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Mabanag</span> <i>vs</i>. Lopez (78 Phil.
1, 4), this Court recognized the problems in trying to make a definition:</p>

<blockquote>"It is a doctrine too well established to need citation of
authorities, that political questions are not within the province of the
judiciary, except to the extent that power to deal with such questions has been
conferred upon the courts by express constitutional or statutory provision. (16
C.J.S., 431).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine is
predicated on the principle of the separation of powers, a principle also too
well known to require elucidation or citation of authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difficulty lies in determining what
matters fall within the meaning of political question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term is not susceptible of exact
definition, and precedents, and authorities are not always in full harmony as
to the scope of the restrictions, on this ground, on the courts to meddle with
the actions of the political departments of the government.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I think it is time for this Court to distinguish between
jurisdiction over a case and jurisdiction over the issues raised in that
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is erroneous to state that when
a petition raises an issue which is political in nature, this Court is without
jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to receive the petition and to
find out whether the issues are indeed political or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A finding of political question is the
province of the Court in all cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
mere allegation of political questions does not automatically divest the Court
of its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court may, therefore,
require the parties to the case to prove or refute the existence of a political
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has jurisdiction to
receive the pleadings to listen to the arguments end to make up its mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once the Court, however, finds that the issue is political in
nature, it should rule that it has jurisdiction to decide the issue one way or
another still renders a decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must still state that according to the Constitution, this matter is not for the
judiciary but for the political departments to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the task We must perform in these
petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When We decide whether or not
the issues are political in nature, We exercise jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If We find a political question, We still
have jurisdiction over the case but not over the specific issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">A lot of emotionalism is directed against the Court when it rules
that a question is political.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
alleged that the Court has surrendered its powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The political question, it is said,
"applies to all those questions of which the Court, at a given time, will
be of the opinion that it is impolitic or inexpedient to take jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes this idea of inexpediency will
result from the fear of the vastness of the consequences that a decision on the
merits might entail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, it will
result from the feeling that the Court is incompetent to deal with the type of
question involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, it will be
induced by the feeling that the matter is too high for the Courts"
(Finkelstein, "Judicial Self Limitation", 38 Harvard Law Review 328,
344). The political question doctrine is, therefore, described as a doctrine of
judicial opportunism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like Pontius
Pilate, the Court is accused of tossing the hot issue for others to
determine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is charged with washing
its hands off a difficult or explosive situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A political question, it is alleged, is
nothing more than any question which the Court does not want to decide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable why courts should have a
seemingly natural or spontaneous tendency to reject a political question
argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge that the Court is
abdicating a function or running away from responsibility can strike to the
very marrow of any judge's feelings.</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not share these misgivings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I positively reject them as wrong impressions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is discharging a constitutional
duty when it determines that an issue is a political question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of its implications, however, this is
a fact which the Court must also explain in the simplest terms possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution defines and limits the powers entrusted by the sovereign
people to their government. First, it declares the boundaries where the powers
of government cannot go further because individual rights would be
impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, it divides the powers
given to the entire government among the various departments and constitutional
bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its provisions are, therefore,
both a grant and a limitation of power.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the Constitution may be likened to a map.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This map shows how the powers of sovereignty
have been distributed among the departments of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shows where there is a sharing of powers
or where checks and balances may be found.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It also shows where there is a dividing line between government power
and individual liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In plainer
language, the constitutional map, like any other map, carries different
boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boundaries are the
delimitations of power.</p>

<p class="BODY">The function of the Court is to fix those boundaries whenever
encroachments are alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so,
the Court interprets the constitutional map.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It declares that this power is executive, that power is legislative, and
that other power is judicial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may
sometimes state that a certain power, like impeachment, is judicial in
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the constitutional
map has included impeachment within the boundaries of legislative
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has to declare that
the judicial power of impeachment is exclusively for the legislature to
exercise.</p>

<p class="BODY">This task of allocating constitutional boundaries, I must repeat,
is given to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
divested of this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
yield this power.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, when the Court finds that a certain power is given by
the Constitution to a co-equal department, it must defer to the decision of
that department even if it appears to be seemingly judicial. It should declare
that the Constitution has vested this determination in the executive or the
legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court must, therefore,
state that it cannot go any further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
sovereign people through the Constitution have drawn a boundary which this
Court has ascertained and which it must respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Court finds a political question, it
is not, therefore, shirking or avoiding a duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="">is, </span>in fact, complying
with its duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much as it wants to go
into the issues and decide the questions, it has to decline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution has given the power of
determination to another department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
interpreter of the Constitution, the Court has <span style="">to </span>lead in respecting its boundaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">If we examine this Court's definition of a political question in <span class="SpellE"><i>Tañada</i></span><i> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span></i>
(G.R. <span style="">No. L-10520, </span><st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="2">February 28, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">), We </span>find
that it conforms to the foregoing explanation.</p>

<blockquote>In short, the term "political question" connotes, in
legal parlance, what it means in ordinary parlance, namely, a question of
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in the language
of Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span> <span class="SpellE">Secundum</span> (<i>supra</i>),
it refers to "those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be
decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which full
discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislature or executive
branch of the Government." It is concerned with issues dependent upon the
wisdom not legality, of a particular measure. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This is a determination of constitutional
boundaries. The Court has found that the Constitution has assigned a political
question to the people through a referendum or either one or both of the
political departments.</p>

<p class="BODY">A more complete definition is found in <i>Baker vs. Carr</i> (369
<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> 186, 7L
Ed. 2d 663, 1962), to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"It is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according
to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question,
which identifies it <span style="">as </span>essentially
a function of the separation of powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political
question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the
issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially
discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of
deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for <span class="SpellE">nonjudicial</span> discretion; or the impossibility of a court's
undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due
coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning
adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of
embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one
question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, the Court makes a determination that the Constitution has
vested the making of a final decision in a body other than the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution is sufficiently explicit in locating the power
to proclaim martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is similarly
explicit in specifying the occasions for its exercise. "In case of
invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the
public safety requires it, he (the President as Commander-in-Chief of all armed
forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
may suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law."</p>

<p class="BODY">This provision on martial law is found in Article VII of the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Article refers to the
Presidency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 10, where the
provision appears as the second paragraph, is exclusively devoted to powers
conferred by the Constitution on the President. This is in sharp contrast to
the Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
where the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
appears, not as a grant of power under Article II on the Executive nor in the
first ten amendments constituting their Bill of Rights, but in Article I on the
Legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is given not as a grant
of power but as a limitation on the powers of the Federal Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that, as regards the suspension of the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the Philippine Constitution treats it
both as a grant of power in the article on the Presidency and as a limitation
to government action in the article on the Bill of Rights. On the other hand,
there is no dual treatment of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is only a grant of power in Article VII to meet certain grave
dangers to the Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the
Constitution is it treated in terms of limitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> &amp; Co., Inc. vs.
Land Tenure Administration, 31 SCRA<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>41,3,
423</i>, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Reference to the <i>historical</i> basis of this provision as
reflected in the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, two of the
extrinsic aids to construction along with contemporaneous understanding and the
consideration of the consequences that flow from the Interpretation under
consideration, yields additional light on the matter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Let us, therefore, look at the history of the provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is important to be guided by the authors
of the Constitution more than by citations from foreign court decisions and
quotations from constitutional law writers which petitioners and respondents
can seem to unendingly cull to sustain their diametrically opposed positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Bill of 1902 had no provision on martial law,
although it provided:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 5. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the
public safety may require it, in either of which events the same may be suspended
by the President, or by the Governor, with the approval of the Philippine
Commission, whenever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall
exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both executive and legislative shared in deciding when the
privilege of the writ may be suspended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Jones Law or Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 required a
similar sharing of power as the Philippine Bill of 1902.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of approval of the Philippine
Commission, however, it provided that the President of the United States must
be notified whenever the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus has been
suspended or martial law has been proclaimed.</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 21 . . He shall be responsible for the faithful
execution of the laws of the Philippine Islands and of the United' States
operative within the Philippine Islands, and whenever it becomes necessary he
may call upon commanders of the military and naval forces of the United States
in the Islands, or summon the <i>posse <span class="SpellE">comitatus</span></i>,
or call out the Militia, or other locally created armed forces, to prevent or
suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion; and <i>he may,

  States</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i> thereof </i>together with the
attending facts, and circumstances, the President shall have power to modify or
vacate the action of the Governor-General." (Italics supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The treatment of both martial law and habeas corpus as part of
the limitations in the Bill of Rights and as part of the grant of powers of the
Chief Executive started with the Jones Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This organic act also added "imminent danger" as a ground for
suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was the status of our Constitutional Law on habeas corpus
and on martial law when the <span style="">1935 </span>Philippine
Constitution was drafted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most
learned Philippine lawyers were among the delegates to the <span style="">1934 </span>Constitutional Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates had before them the Philippine
Bill of <span style="">1902 </span>requiring approval
of the legislature before the Chief Executive may exercise his power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had before them the provision of the
Jones Law qualifying the Governor-General's power with supervision and control
by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
who may modify or vacate the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They chose to vest the power exclusively in
the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">They expanded the wide scope of his
authority by including "imminent danger" as an occasion for its
exercise, thus deliberately adopting the Jones Law provision minus the
limitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their proposal on martial
law was overwhelmingly ratified by the people.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The choice was no perfunctory or casual
one. It was the product of thorough study and deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the debates in the 1935 Constitutional
Convention centered on habeas corpus, they necessarily apply to martial law
because the two are inextricably linked in one and the same provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor-General has summarized these
deliberations on habeas corpus and martial law.</p>

<blockquote>"As a matter of fact, in the Constitutional Convention,
Delegate <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> proposed the following provisions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘In case of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion, when the public
safety requires it, the National Assembly may suspend the privilege of the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incase the
National Assembly is not in session, the President may suspend the privilege of
the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> with the consent of the majority of the
Supreme Court, but this suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> will be revoked if the President does not call a special session of
the National Assembly within fifteen days from the decree suspending the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i> or if the National Assembly fails to confirm the action
of the President within 30 days. (5 J. Laurel, Proceedings of the Philippine
Constitutional Convention; <span style="">259, </span>(S.
Laurel ed. 1966)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In support of' his proposal, <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
argued, <i>first</i>, that the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus should be vested in the National Assembly because that power was
"essentially" legislative. (Id. 249-­50) and <i>second</i>, that in
case the National Assembly was not in session, thus making it necessary to vest
the power in the President, that the exercise of the power be subject to the
concurrence of the Supreme Court and even when the Court has concurred in the
decision of the President that the suspension would be effective only for a
certain period unless the National Assembly was convened and its ratification
was secured. (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>, at 255).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He was <span class="SpellE">interpellated</span> by various
delegates; Delegate Perez and <span class="SpellE">Grageda</span>, especially,
were concerned, lest the requirement of securing the concurrence of other
branches of government in the decision of the President deprives him of
effective means of meeting an emergency. (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>,
at <span style="">255-56).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The Committee on Sponsorship headed by
Delegate Sotto opposed the amendment. When finally put to vote, the amendment
was rejected. (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>, at <span style="">259).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are a number of points we should note regarding the
proposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, the proposal refers
only to the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not apparently contemplate the proclamation
of martial law. <i>Second</i>, the proposal would vest the power of suspension
in the National Assembly and in the President only when the National Assembly
is not in session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Third</i>,
exercise of the power by <span style="">the President,
</span>is subject to the concurrence of the Supreme Court and the confirmation
of the National Assembly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Constitutional Convention must have been aware of the
experience of President Lincoln during the American Civil War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must have been aware of the views
expressed then that it was the legislature and not the President who may
suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or proclaim martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, they were cognizant of the
vast implications incident to a suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> and more so to the proclamation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is reelected in the following records of
the proceedings:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'During the debates on the first draft, Delegate Francisco proposed
an amendment inserting, as a fourth cause for the suspension of the writ of
habeas corpus, imminent danger of the three causes included herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When submitted to a vote for the first time,
the amendment was carried.</p>

<p class="2Q">After his Motion for a reconsideration of the amendment was
approved, Delegate <span class="SpellE">Orense</span> spoke against the amendment
alleging that it would be dangerous to make imminent danger a ground for the
suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In part, he said:</p>

<p class="2Q">'Gentlemen, this phrase is <span style="">too
</span>ambiguous, and in the hands of a President who believes himself more or
less a dictator, it is extremely dangerous; it would be a sword with which he
would behead <span style="">us."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">‘In defense of the amendment, Delegate Francisco pointed out that
it was intended to make this part of the bill of rights conform to that part of
the draft giving the President the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
also in the case of an imminent danger of invasion or rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked by Delegate <span class="SpellE">Rafols</span>
if the phrase, imminent danger, might not be struck out from the corresponding
provision under the executive power instead, Delegate Francisco answered:</p>

<p class="2Q">'Outright, it is possible to eliminate the phrase, imminent danger
thereof, in the page I have mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I say, going to the essence and referring exclusively to the
necessity of including the words, of imminent danger or one or the other, I
wish to say the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that it
should not be necessary that there exist a rebellion, insurrection, or invasion
in order that habeas corpus may be suspended. It should be sufficient that there
exists not a danger but an imminent danger, and the word, imminent should be
maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When there exists an
imminent danger, the State requires for its protection, and for <span style="">that of all the citizens the suspension of the
habeas corpus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'When put to vote for the second time, the amendment was defeated
with 72 votes against and 56 votes in favor of the same. (I <span class="SpellE">Aruego's</span>
Framing of the Philippine Constitution, 180-181)"</p>

<blockquote>"But the Convention voted for a strong executive, and wrote
Article VII, Section 10 <span style="">(2) </span>into
the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The conferment of the power in the President is clear and
definite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the authority to suspend
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and to proclaim martial law
was intended to be exclusively vested in the President, there can be no
doubt." (Memorandum for Respondents dated November <span style="">17, 1972, </span>pp. <span style="">11-14)"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only conclusion I can make after ascertaining the intent of
the authors of the Constitution is that the power to proclaim martial law is
exclusively vested in the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proclamation and its attendant circumstances therefore form a political
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unless this Court decides that every act of the executive and of
the legislature is <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> there can be no
clearer example of a political question that Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the exercise by the highest elective
official of the land of a <span style="">supreme </span>political
duty exclusively entrusted to him by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our people have entrusted to the President
through a specific provision of the fundamental law the awesome responsibility
to wield a powerful weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people
have entrusted to him the estimation that the perils are so ominous and
threatening that this ultimate weapon of our duly constituted government must
be used.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court was not given the jurisdiction to share the
determination of the occasions for its exercise. It is not given the authority
by the Constitution to expand or limit the scope of its use depending on the
allegations of litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
authorized by the Constitution to say that martial law may be proclaimed in <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> but not in
Greater Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less does it have
the power nor should it even exercise the power, assuming its existence, to
nullify a proclamation of the President on a matter exclusively vested in him
by the Constitution and on issues so politically and emotionally charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court's function in such cases is to
assume jurisdiction for the purpose of finding out whether the issues
constitute a political question or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its function is to determine whether or not a question is indeed <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners want this Court to examine the bases given by the
President in issuing Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They want the Court to find or to take judicial notice of the absence of
an insurrection or rebellion — of the absence of an imminent danger thereof.
Petitioners would have this Court dispute and nullify the findings of facts of
the President himself in a matter that is peculiarly executive in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why should We honor the President's findings?</p>

<p class="BODY">In cases where the issues are indisputably judicial in nature,
the findings of the President are still given utmost respect and
deference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the matter of the
declaration of martial law, a power that is exclusively vested in the
President, may the Court differ with the findings? No, because as We have
already stated, <i>the valid reason for this exclusive grant of power is that
the President possesses all the facilities to gather the required data and
information and has a broader perspective to properly evaluate them, better
than any facility and perspective that the Court can have.</i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>At what state in an insurrection or how serious and manifest
should subversive activities become before the Court decides the particular
point when martial law may be proclaimed? The petitioners, relying on the
classic stages of governmental overthrow as experienced by pre-World War II
examples, would wait until all civil courts are closed and the country is </i><i><span style="">in </span>complete chaos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners do not realize that long before
the courts are closed, the President would have been killed or captured and the
enemy irrevocably entrenched in power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The authors of the Constitution never envisioned that the martial law
power so carefully and deliberately included among the powers of the President
would be withheld until such time as it may not be used at all.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>It is my firm view that the decision to proclaim martial law
is an exclusive function of the President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If he finds that invasion, insurrection, or rebellion or imminent danger
of any of the three is present, such finding is conclusive on the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he finds that public safety requires the
entire country should be placed under martial law, that finding is conclusive
on the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise of such an
emergency power intended for the supreme and inherent right of self-defense and
self-preservation, the Constitution cannot be read to mean otherwise.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i>vs</i>. Garcia (42 SCRA
448, 480) this Court stated that "in the exercise of such authority (to
suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus), the function of the Court
is merely to <i>check</i> — not to <i>supplant</i> — the <i>Executive</i>, <i>or
to ascertain merely whether he has gone beyond the constitutions limits of his
jurisdiction, not to exercise the power vested</i> in him or to determine the
wisdom of his act."</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not see how, both from the legal and practical points of
view, the Court can check the President's decision to proclaim martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same may, perhaps, be done as
regards a suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus although I
reserve a more definitive statement on that issue when a case squarely in point
on the matter is raised before Us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, martial law poses entirely different problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A proclamation of martial law goes beyond the
suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, whose effects are
largely remedied with the release of detainees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon proclaiming martial law, the President did not limit himself
to ordering the arrest and detention of the participants and others having a
hand in the conspiracy to seize political and state power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under martial law, the President ordered the
takeover or control of communications media, public utilities, and privately
owned aircraft and watercraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Foreign
travel was restricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curfew was
imposed all over the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A purge of
undesirable government officials, through resignations or summary
investigations, was effected. The entire executive branch of government was
reorganized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cleanliness and
beautification campaign, with martial law sanctions to enforce it, was
ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was only the beginning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequences of Proclamation No. 1081 are many and
far-reaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They permeate every aspect
and every activity in the life of the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A court decision is not needed nor is it the proper place to enumerate
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most obvious, of course, are the
President's acts of legislation on the very broad range of subjects that
Congress used to cover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1972</st1:date>, the petitioners
prepared a Memorandum stressing this point.</p>

<blockquote>It may be pointed out that since martial law was declared, the
President has been exercising legislative power that is lodged by the
Constitution in Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A good number
of the decrees promulgated have no direct relation to the quelling of the
disorders caused by the lawless elements. They are aimed at building a New
Society, but they cannot be justified as a valid exercise of martial, rule. (at
page 94)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><i>These implications and consequences of martial law serve to
bolster my view that the Constitution never intended that this Court could
examine and declare invalid the President's initial determination. The
Constitution did not intend that the Court could, in the detached and peaceful <span class="SpellE">aftermatch</span> of successful martial law, reach back and
invalidate everything done from the start.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would result in chaos.</i></p>

371, 374) doctrine which this Court adopted in <i>Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pangandapun</span> Benito</i>,
et al. (27 SCRA 533, 540):</p>

<blockquote>The Courts below have proceeded on the theory that the Act of
Congress having been found to be unconstitutional, was not a law; that it was
inoperative, conferring no rights and imposing no duties, and hence affording
no basis for the challenged decree. (Norton <i>vs</i>. <st1:place><st1:placename>Shelby</st1:placename>

559, 566).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite clear, however,
that such broad statements as to the effect of a determination of
unconstitutionality must be taken with qualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actual existence of a statute, prior to
such a determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which
cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effect of the
subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects
— with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and
particular conduct, private and official.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Questions of rights claimed to have become vested of status, of prior
determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public
policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous
application, demand examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
questions are among the most difficult of those which have engaged the
attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous
decisions that an all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute
retroactive invalidity cannot be justified."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may be argued that the actual existence of Proclamation No.
1081 is an operative fact and that its consequences should not be ignored.</p>

<p class="BODY">The operative fact doctrine, however, has no application in this
situation where, faced with insurrection and rebellion, the President proclaims
martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that every
single member of this Court doubts the President's findings, We have to
consider that the Constitution vests the determination in him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stakes involved are supreme and the
determination must be made immediately and decisively.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>There is the possibility that the President has an exaggerated
appreciation of the dangers and has overreacted with the use of the awesome
measure of martial law. The fact remains, however, that the authors of the
Constitution were aware of this possibility and still provided that the power
exclusively belongs to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be
stretching the plain words of the Constitution if we weigh our personal
findings against the official </i><i><span style="">findings
of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He possesses all the
facilities </span>to </i><i><span style="">gather </span>data
</i><i><span style="">and information and has a much </span>broader
</i><i><span style="">perspective to properly </span></i><i><span style="">evaluate </span></i><i><span style="">them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span>is performing a
func</i><i><span style="">tion which is, </span>of
course, required by the </i><i><span style="">Constitution
to </span></i><i><span style="">be discharged </span>by
</i><i><span style="">the President.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="">And for us to venture
into a judicial inquiry on the </span>factual basis of </i><i><span style="">the constitutionality of the martial law </span>proclamation
would be </i><i><span style="">to ignore the
well-established principle </span>of </i><i><span style="">presidential privilege which exempts the </span>President </i><i><span style="">from divulging even to the highest court of
the land </span>facts </i><i><span style="">which if
divulged would endanger national security.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span></i>As a matter of fact, in the latest case on this matter which
was that filed against President Richard M. Nixon, although the Supreme Court
of the United States ordered the President to produce the tapes of his
conversation with some of his aides pursuant to a subpoena for use in a
criminal prosecution against one of his aides, because the claim that
"disclosures of confidential conversation between the President and his
close advisors … would be inconsistent with the public interest ... cannot
outweigh ... the legitimate needs of the judicial process" in a criminal
prosecution, the Court, however, made the statement from which we can infer
that if President Nixon had only claimed that the tapes contain "military,
diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets", it would have sustained
the refusal of Nixon to <span style="">produce them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"... However, when the privilege depends solely on the broad,
undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such
conversations, a confrontation with other values arises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Absent a claim of need to protect
military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, we find it
difficult to accept the argument</i> that even the very important interest in
confidentiality of presidential communications is significantly diminished by
production of such material for in camera inspection with all the protection
that a district court will be obliged to provide."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this case the President challenges a subpoena served on
him as a third party requiring the production of materials for use in a
criminal prosecution on the claim that he has a privilege against disclosure of
confidential communications. He does not place his claim of privilege on the
ground they are military or diplomatic secrets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to these areas of Art. II duties the courts have traditionally shown
the utmost deference to presidential responsibilities. In C. &amp; S. Air Lines
<i>vs</i>. Waterman Steamship Corp., <span style="">333
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> 103, 111 (1948), </span>dealing with
presidential authority involving foreign policy considerations, the Court said:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The President, both as Commander-in-chief and as the Nation's
organ for foreign affairs, has available intelligence services whose reports
are not and ought not to he published to the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be intolerable that courts, without
relevant information, should review and perhaps nullify actions of the
Executive taken on information properly held secret." <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>
at 111</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> <i>vs</i>. Reynolds, <span style="">345 U.S. 1 (1952), </span>dealing with a
claimant's demand for evidence in a damage <span style="">case, against the </span>Government, the Court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘It may be possible to satisfy the court, from all the
circumstances of the case, that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of
the evidence <span style="">will expose military
matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be
divulged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this is the case, the
occasion for the privilege is appropriate, and the court should not jeopardize
the security which the privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an
examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">No </span>case
of the Court, however, has extended this high degree of deference to a
President's generalized interest in confidentiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the Constitution, as we have noted
earlier, is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality, yet
<span style="">to </span>the extent this interest
relates to the effective discharge of a President's powers, it is
constitutionally based."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is for the above reasons that, as far as the proclamation is
concerned, the Court should revert to the rule in <span class="SpellE"><i>Barcelon</i></span><i>
vs. Baker</i> (6 Phil. 87) and <i>Montenegro vs. Castaneda</i> (91 Phil.
886).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only questions which the
judiciary should look into are (1) Did the Constitution confer the authority to
suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and proclaim martial law on
the President? and (2) Did the President declare that he is acting under such
authority and in conformance with it? The authority being exclusively vested in
the President, his decision is final and conclusive upon the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the President's decision to proclaim martial law is
concerned, it <span style="">is, </span>therefore, my
view that under the Constitution, the Supreme Court has no authority to inquire
into the existence of a factual basis for its proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional sufficiency for the

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">GRANTING THAT PROCLAMATION NO. 1081 IS NOT POLITICAL
BUT JUSTICIABLE, IT IS STILL VALID BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT ACTED
ARBITRARILY IN ISSUING IT</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that Proclamation No. 1081 is not a mere conclusion
that there is insurrection and rebellion in the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President did not limit himself to a curt
and laconic declaration that on the basis of his findings, there is
insurrection or a rebellion and that he has proclaimed martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proclamation No. 1081 specifies in twenty-six (26) printed pages
the various findings which led to its promulgation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conspiracy to overthrow the government,
the rapidly expanding ranks of<span style=""> </span>the
conspirators, the raising of funds and materials under centralized direction,
the maintenance of a rebel army, the massive propaganda campaign, the acts of
sabotage and armed insurrection or rebellion, the previous decision of this
Court, the lawlessness and disorder in the country, the violent demonstrations
led by Communist fronts, the armed clashes between rebels and government
troops, the active moral and material support of a foreign power, the
importation of firearms and war material by rebels, the presence of a
well-scheduled program of revolutionary action, the organization of liquidation
squads, the serious disorder in Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>,
the activities of the Mindanao Independence Movement, the thousands killed and
hundreds of thousands of injured or displaced persons, the inadequacy of simply
calling out the armed forces or suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus, the alarmingly rapid escalation of rebel or subversive activities, and
other evidence of insurrection or rebellion are specified in detailed manner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the President are given in a positive, detailed,
and categorical form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, subsequent events, related to the Court in a series of classified
briefings made to it by the Army, the last one being on August 15, 1974,
confirm the over-all validity of the President's basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is constitutional sufficiency for his
conclusion that martial law be proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proclamation No. 1081 does not, therefore, suffer any constitutional
infirmity of arbitrariness, granting that this test can be applied to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears proper, at this point, to elucidate further on the
test of arbitrariness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's decision in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i>
</i><i><span style="">vs. Garcia</span></i><span style=""> </span>(42 SCRA 448) has been interpreted
and, to my mind, misunderstood by many people to mean that the Court had
completely reversed <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Barcelon</span></i></span><i><span style=""> vs. </span>Baker</i> and <i><span style="">Montenegro vs. </span>Castaneda</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, of course, certain statements in
the decision that give rise to this conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, the Court stated that the weight of <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Barcelon</span></i></span><i><span style=""> vs. Baker</span></i><span style="">, as </span>precedent, is diluted by two factors, namely, (a) it relied
heavily upon <i>Martin </i><i><span style="">vs. </span>Mott</i>
(6 L. ed. 537) involving the U.S. President's power to call out the militia and
(b) the fact that suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas, corpus was
by the American Governor-General, the representative of the foreign
sovereign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court stated that in the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Barcelon</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>case it went into the question — Did
the Governor?General act in conformance with the authority vested in him
by the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>?
In other words, the Court stated that it made an actual determination whether
or not the Chief Executive had acted in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court also added that in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>
case, it considered the question whether or not there really was a
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court reviewed American
jurisprudence on suspension of the privilege. It stated that the tenor of the
opinions, considered as a whole, strongly suggests the Court's conviction that
the conditions essential for the validity of proclamations or orders were in
fact present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stated that whenever
the American courts took the opposite view, it had a backdrop permeated or
characterized by the belief that said conditions were absent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In truth, however, the decision in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i>
vs. Garcia</i> does not state that the Court may conduct a full examination
into the facts which led the President to issue the <span style="">proclamat</span>ion.<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The Court's decision categorically
asserts that the examination presidential acts by the Court is limited to
arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court accepted the
view —</p>

<blockquote>... that judicial inquiry into the basis of the questioned
proclamation can go no further than to satisfy the Court not that the
President's decision is correct and that public safety was endangered by the
rebellion and justified the suspension of the writ, but that in suspending the
writ, the President did not act arbitrarily.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court adopted as the test of validity, the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><i>Nebbia</i></span><i> vs. New York</i>. <span style="">291 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
502 —</p>

<blockquote><span style="">. . . </span>If the laws
passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose,
and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process
are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court <span class="SpellE">functus</span> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> ... With the
wisdom of the policy adopted, with the adequacy or practicality of the law
enacted to forward it, the courts are both incompetent and unauthorized to deal
...</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of comparison and emphasis, the Court, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i> vs. Garcia</i>. went into the judicial
authority to review decisions of administrative bodies or agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stated that the reviewing court determines
only whether there is some evidentiary basis for the contested administrative
findings and does not undertake quantitative examination of supporting
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the Court stated
that it interferes with an administrative finding only if there is no evidence
whatsoever in support thereof and said finding is actually arbitrary,
capricious, and obviously unauthorized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court ruled that this approach of deferring to the findings of <span style="">administrative </span>bodies cannot even be
applied in its aforesaid form to test the validity of an act of Congress or of
the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of
validity is of a much higher category. The Court emphasized that the
co-equality of coordinat<span style="">e</span> branches
of the government under our constitutional system demands that the test of
validity of acts of Congress and of those of the Executive should be
fundamentally the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>And this test
is not correctness but arbitrariness</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows, therefore, that even if I were to subscribe to the
view that <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i> </i><i><span style="">vs. Garcia</span></i><span style=""> </span>should not be categorically reversed as <span style="">erroneous </span>doctrine, my decision would be the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even under <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Gorica</span></i> martial law is valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing arbitrary in the decision to promulgate
Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
unconstitutional.</p>

QUESTION</p>

<p class="BODY">The continuation of the state of martial law and t<span style="">he </span>resulting continued restrictions on
individual liberties are, of course, serious aspects of the main issue <span style="">with </span>which this Court is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, this is the more difficult question — The President
having acted upon an initial and positive finding that martial law is
necessary, may the Court inquire into the bases for its duration or the need
for its continued imposition?</p>

<p class="BODY">Towards the end of this separate opinion, I answer the arguments
of the petitioners questioning the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> and
legality of the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
my unqualified vi<span style="">e</span>w, as explained
later, that this Court in the Ratification Cases declared the new Constitution
to be legally in force and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">I have to mention this view, at this juncture, because martial
law was proclaimed under the old Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, its continuation and eventual lifting are now governed by the
new Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The exercise of martial law power may be likened to the
jurisdiction of a court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court may
have jurisdiction under an old law but the jurisdiction may be removed or
modified by a new statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, is the continuing state of martial law valid under the new Constitution?
Is it also a political question under the present Charter?</p>

<p class="BODY">Article IX of the new Constitution on the Prime Minister and the
Cabinet provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 12. The Prime Minister shall be commander-in-chief of
all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may
call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion,
insurrection, or rebellion in case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or
imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the Philippines or any part
thereof under martial law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the above provision is a verbatim
reiteration of Article VII, Section 10, Paragraph (2) of the old Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">What was the intent of the framers in adopting verbatim the
provision found in the old Constitution?</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, modesty and prudence should inhibit me from advancing
my own views as the only member of this Tribunal who was <span style="">a </span>delegate to the <span style="">1971 </span>Constitutional Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <i><span style="">Vera

<blockquote>"The theory has been proposed — modest<span style="">y </span>aside — that the dissenting members of this Court who were
delegates to the Constitutional Convention and were "co-authors of the
Constitution" "are in a better position to interpret" that same
Constitution in this particular litigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no doubt that their properly recorded utterances during
the debates and proceedings of the Convention deserve weight, like those of any
other delegate therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note, however,
that the proceedings of the Convention "are less conclusive of the proper
construction of the instrument than are legislative proceedings of the proper
construction of a statue; since in the latter case it is the intent of the
legislature we seek, while in the former we are endeavoring to arrive at the
intent of the people through the discussions and deliberations of their
representatives." (<st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>
on the Constitution, Vol. I, pp. 54, 55.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Their writings (of the delegates) commenting or explaining
that instrument, published shortly thereafter, may, like those of Hamilton,
Madison and Jay in The Federalist — here in the Philippines, the book of
Delegate <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>, supra, and of others — have
persuasive force. (Op. cit., p. <span style="">55.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But their personal opinion on the matter at issue expressed
during our deliberations stand on a different footing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If based on a "fact" known to them,
but not duly established or judicially cognizable, it is immaterial, and their
brethren are not expected to take their word for it, to the prejudice of the
party adversely affected, who had no chance of rebuttal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If on a matter of legal hermeneutics, their
conclusions may not, simply on account of membership in the Convention, be a
shade better, in the eyes of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the word "deference" to be sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But deference is a compliment spontaneously
to be paid — never a tribute to be demanded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And if we should (without intending any disparagement)
compare the Constitution's enactment to a drama on the stage or in actual life,
we would realize that the intelligent spectators or readers often know as much,
if not more, about the real meaning, effects or tendencies of the event, or
incidents thereof, as some of the actors themselves, who sometimes become so
absorbed in fulfilling their emotional roles that they fail to watch the other
scenes or to meditate on the larger aspects of the whole performance, or what
is worse, become so infatuated with their lines as to construe the entire story
according to their prejudices or frustrations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perspective and disinterestedness help certainly a lot in examining
actions and occurrences.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Come to think of it, under the theory thus proposed, Marshall
and Holmes (names venerated by those who have devoted a sizeable portion of
their professional lives to analyzing or solving constitutional problems and
developments) were not so authoritative after all in expounding the United

the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amendment
discussions and debates which took place during legislative caucuses are
unrecorded and this Court has Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span> to
thank for his recollections.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in this spirit<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
I venture my own recollections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
also fairly certain that when the proceedings of the 1971 Constitutional
Convention are published, my observations will be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the last Constitutional Convention
approved the New Constitution on <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1972</st1:date>, the delegates were aware of pre-convention proposals to
subject exercise of the power by the Executive to judicial inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Studies on the wisdom of having a joint
exercise of the power by the Executive and the Legislature were before the
delegates. (U.P. Law Center Constitution Revision Project, 1970. pp. 104-108)
There were even constitutional law scholars who questioned the power altogether
and wanted it removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed that
whether or not martial law is in the Constitution, it will be declared when
absolutely necessary and, therefore, anticipating its use through a
constitutional provision serves no useful purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The delegates were fully aware of the Government stand on the
habeas corpus and martial law provision. The <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i>
vs. Garcia</i> decision was fairly recent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The powers of the Chief Executive were extensively debated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delegates knew that in the <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i> vs. Garcia</i> proceedings, the Solicitor
General had consistently and forcefully argued that <span class="SpellE"><i>Barcelon</i></span><i>
vs. Baker</i> and <i>Montenegro vs. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span></i>
were correct interpretations of the President's power to suspend the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus or place the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or any part thereof under martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">More significant is the fact that when the new Constitution was
finalized and the draft corrected and approved prior to submission to the
people, we were already under a state of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners had been arrested and various
petitions filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioner E.
Voltaire Garcia II included in his petition the argument that his detention
pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 deprived his constituency of their
representation in the Constitutional Convention. The delegates were aware that
Proclamation No. 1081 was challenged before this Court and that the Solicitor
General's answer to all the petitions was invariably the doctrine of political
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">If it was the intent of the Constitutional Convention to subject
the Prime Minister's exercise of the power to judicial inquiry and/or control,
the provision on martial law would have been accordingly amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, during deliberations of the
Committees on Civil and Political Rights and Executive Power, there were
proposals that the power to proclaim martial law be subjected to control,
confirmation, or reversal by Congress or the Supreme Court, but the Convention
did not accept any of these proposals and decided to simply reiterate the
earlier provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be enlightening for us to peruse the pertinent portions
of the proceedings of the Committee on Civil and Political Rights and Executive
Power, and I quote:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">OPENING
OF THE MEETING<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="50" hour="9">9:50 a.m.</st1:time>, Chairman Victor De la Serna called the meeting
to order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon certification of the
Secretary, the Chair announced the existence of a quorum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair then announced
that the Committee has furnished the body resolutions regarding the suspension
of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. The Chair mentioned six
Resolutions Numbered 176, 260, 531, 1415, 239 and 2394.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair further said
that the resolutions can be grouped into three schools of thought — the first,
refers to the absolute prohibition against suspension of the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus by any authority in any and all events; the second
supports the theory that it may be suspended by the President with the
concurrence of Congress or the Supreme Court; and the third, refers to the
removal of the power to suspend from the President and transfer the same to the
Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Chair then introduced to the
members the guest speaker, Justice Enrique Fernando of the Supreme Court of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He expressed few words of welcome to the
Justice in behalf of the two Committees conducting the public hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernando started
his remarks by clarifying that he would only answer questions that will not
conflict with his role as Justice of the Supreme Court, since there was a
pending case before the said Court where the Power of the President to suspend
the writ of habeas corpus is placed at issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that he considered the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus as
the most important human right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is of
the view that it might be preferable if the Bill of Rights make it clear and
explicit that at no time and under no circumstances should the privilege of the
writ be suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He clarified that
even if this power to suspend the privilege of the writ were removed from the
President, he still has enough powers to prevent rebellion, sedition,
insurrection or imminent danger thereof because of his power to call the armed
forces in case the need for it arises.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair asked the first
question to Justice Fernando.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
the Justice said that it was not necessary to grant the President the power to
suspend the writ since Congress can always pass a law that would lengthen the
period of detention of prisoners, the Chair asked if it would not be very
cumbersome for Congress to enact such a law in times of national emergency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernando, in
answer to the Chair's query, said that Congress can pass a law to that effect
without a national emergency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to question
propounded by Delegate <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span>, Justice Fernando said
in 1951 in the Hernandez case he expressed the opinion that even if the
privilege of the writ were suspended, the right to bail could still be availed
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted, however, that up to now
there is no clear-cut ruling on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also said that the President, should have the sole power to declare
Martial Law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> also asked Justice Fernando who would determine
the circumstances that would warrant the detention of prisoners for a longer
period than what is now provided under the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Justice answered that if the prisoner is
held for crimes against public order, then the ordinary rules of criminal law
will govern. The arresting authorities, in collaboration with the Fiscal, will
determine said circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11. Delegate <span class="SpellE">Laggui</span> asked Justice
Fernando whether he would still deny the power to suspend the writ to the
President if the Convention writes into the Constitution safeguards against
abuse of said power. The Justice said he would still say that the power be
denied the President because he considers the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus as the most important human right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12. Delegate <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> <span class="SpellE">interpellated</span> the Justice and asked whether the latter
would favor preventive detention of political prisoners or political offenders.
The Justice said we should follow the Constitutional Provisions regarding
probable cause, and the rights of the <span style="">accused
</span>should always be respected.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">13. </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Santillan</span> asked Justice Fernando whether he would favor the
proposal to delete the phrase "imminent danger thereof" and to limit
the suspension of the writ from <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10</st1:time> to
<span style="">15 </span>days unless Congress or the
Supreme Court would extend the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice Fernando said, since he was for the denial of the power to
suspend the writ, anything less than that would not be in consonance with his
stand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>14. Delegate <span class="SpellE">Zafra</span> asked Justice Fernando
if it would not be dangerous for a President to declare Martial Law because if
he did, the military might take over the government and topple down the
President and even Congress, thereby establishing military dictatorship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Fernando said that the danger exists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>15. Delegate <span class="SpellE">Exmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">interpellated</span>
Justice Fernando and asked the latter what the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
should have done instead of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus, considering the chaos and turmoil that prevailed prior to <span style="">the </span>suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Justice said that since it is the duty of
the President to faithfully execute the laws, he should and he could have
called out the armed forces to suppress insurrection, invasion, and rebellion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others like Delegates <span class="SpellE">Mastura</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adil</span>, <span style="">Guzman, </span><span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> (O.). and <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span> <span class="SpellE">interpellated</span> Justice Fernando.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair then thanked the Justice for his
enlightening speech, He expressed the hope that at some future time, the
Justice would again favor the Committee with, his appearance so that the
members could propound more questions.</blockquote>

OF MEETING<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 a.m.</st1:time>
Chairman Victor De la Serna called the meeting to order and declared the
existence of a working quorum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Chariman</span> Gerardo S.
<span class="SpellE">Espina</span> stated that it was a joint hearing of the
Committee on Civil and Political Rights and the Committee on Executive Powers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair confirmed the statement of Chairman
<span class="SpellE">Espina</span> and further slated that it was the second
joint hearing of<span style=""> </span>the two
Committees and introduced Senator Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>,
guest speaker for the hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
thanked the joint body for giving him an opportunit<span style="">y</span> to discuss with them the power to suspend the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the power to declare martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be able to resolve the problem, he
propounded the questions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) should the
President have the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus,
(2) assuming he was given the power, under what circumstances should he be
allowed to exercise it, and (3) what safeguards should be placed upon the
exercise of that power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He surmised that
in his opinion, if the only legal basis for the grant of the power is to bide
time to be able to bring persons to court for it to decide on the matter, as
such time is always available to the government, he saw no reason in suspending
the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, since the same objective can be
attained by the imposition of martial law, which is not a graver step and is
not gravely abused in the practical point of view that no President will
declare martial law unless he can have the armed forces agree with him that
there is actual invasion, rebellion or<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that the
present Constitution only allowed the suspension of the privilege in cases of
extreme emergency affecting the very sovereignty of the State, which in his
belief, is only in cases of invasion, rebellion or insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not agree that there should be a
safeguard provided, prior to the issuance of the proclamation suspending the
privilege of the writ but rather after the writ has been suspended, by
requiring either the courts or Congress to pass upon the necessity of the
suspension of the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He dissented with
the idea that there should be a definite time period for its validity, because
it is difficult to determine what should be an adequate period, however, the
Supreme Court or Congress could always be required to act <span style="">within a definite period </span>on the
validity of the suspension which he considered, already a proper safeguard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He added further that the power to place
any part of the national territory under martial law should be limited to cases
only of actual invasion, rebellion or insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he strongly favored the deletion 'of
the provision "on imminent danger", which he stressed, is an excuse
for a dictatorial President to declare martial law on the ground that there is
imminent danger when there is none.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a possibility, he said, that the armed forces will be broken
up, in the sense that one group may favor the President and the other may
refuse to allow themselves to be used when there is actually no "imminent
danger", so that instead of their helping preserve peace and order it
"would provide an occasion for bringing about revolutions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair asked the Senator if the President
should declare martial law in places where imminent danger actually exists and
the civil authorities are still functioning. He further qualified in the phrase
"martial law" that the civil authorities call upon the military
authorities to help them or is it a complete and arbitrary substitution of
authority by the military.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
replied that the President's action in his personal opinion, is arbitrary and
illegal, but who could stop him from doing that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the Supreme Court is reluctant to act
because it has the army to reckon with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He construed that martial law could be legally exercised only in places where
actual fighting exists and the civil authorities are no longer exercising
authority, in which case the military can supplant the civil authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that it is also possible to declare
a limited martial law in certain areas where the military may impose curfew and
temporary detention of persons charged of causing and participating in chaotic
situations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chairman <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>
recognized Delegate <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Britanico</span></span><span style=""> who had the </span>first option to <span class="SpellE">interpellate</span> the Senator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.1<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span>
wanted to know from the Senator whether, in his opinion, the power to suspend
the writ be altogether removed from the President, and that in the event this
power is retained, how should it be exercised by the <span style="">President?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.2<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
replied that if this power is retained it should be exercised by the President
alone but subject to review by either Congress or the Parliamentary Body that
may eventually be adopted.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">6.3<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Delegate </span><span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> wanted the view of
the Senator if he was agreeable to have the President share the power with the
Vice President, Senate majority and minority floor leaders, Senate President,
Justices of the Supreme Court, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Chairman
and other heads of constitutional organizations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.4<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
replied that, he is averse to sharing powers because it could not be done
expediently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator reminded the group
that as a general rule, the President and the President of the Senate belong to
the same party and even the justices of the Supreme Court fall under the same
situation, and it would then still be the President who will decide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chair called on Delegate <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span> on his reservation to ask the next question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.1<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span>
wanted to clarify if there is any technical distinction between suspension of
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the writ itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.2<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
replied that the writ itself is the order of the court to the person having
custody of the subject to produce him in court, and that the subject has the
privilege to post bail pending the filing of the case against him if he is to
be heard for an offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cited the
decision of the Confederate Authority which says that the privilege of the writ
refers to criminal arrests in which the persons arrested have the privilege to
be released on bail, which is the privilege that is suspended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.3<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span>
asked whether the Senator's stand on the abolition of the power to suspend the
privilege of the writ or as an alternative, the suspension be exercised with
the participation of other agencies, is because of the anti-administration
group clamoring for its abolition from the constitutional provisions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.4<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
reiterated his statement that it is his personal belief that martial law is a
better measure than the suspension of the privilege of the writ, which the
President claims to have exercised to dismantle the communist apparatus in the
country. Whether this is justified or not remains an issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the Communists are arrested
now, new leaders will come up and take over command, and these new ones are not
yet known to the military authorities and so the same communistic situation
continues to exist and the cycle goes on unresolved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.5<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a last question, Delegate <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span> sought to be clarified on the alternative view of
the Senator — that of retaining the power but its exercise be with the concurrence
of Congress and the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.6<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator reiterated that he is for the
abolition of the power, but if the Constitutional Convention believes it
necessary to retain it, then its exercise by the executive must be subject to
review and reversal, if need be, by Congress and the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He maintained that the exercise of the power
to suspend the privilege of the writ is determined by two factors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) legality and, (2) wisdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court shall determine the
legality and Congress determines the wisdom of the President's exercise of the
power, and it is the convention that can resolve this problem.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chairman <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>
called on Delegate Barrera, however, requested the Members to limit their
questions to only two to allow everybody the opportunity to question the guest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.1<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate Barrera stated that the Senator is
for the discarding of the constitutional provision on the power to suspend the
privilege of the writ of <i><span style="">habeas
corpus</span></i><span style="">, </span>but is for the
right of an organ of government to declare martial law but limited to an actual
existence of invasion, rebellion or insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was confirmed by the Senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate Barrera inquired whether the Senator
agrees or not to the fact that in places where actual fighting or actual
invasion, rebellion or insurrection exists, declaration of martial law is
unnecessary since the commander-in-chief has the full responsibility of
exercising every step necessary to protect and preserve the welfare of the
nation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.2<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
replied that while it is true that the power to take all the necessary steps to
preserve peace and order and protect the people, is inherent power of
sovereignty, yet it would certainly be safer to provide his power of formal
declaration to prevent individual arbitrary exercise of power by military
commanders in the field. He stressed the need for a specific for a specific
constitutional provision which must be clearly stated and defined as to the
extent of the exercise of such powers.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate Padua (C.) disclosed that he is an
author of a resolution removing powers of the President to suspend the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> as well as to declare martial
law, and his point of concern lies in the subsequent grant of emergency powers
that are complimentary to exercise of martial law by the President now given in
the present Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked the
Senator whether the criterion in the exercise of martial law to actual invasion
only — that is, remove the terms "rebellion and insurrection" as part
of the criteria, would diminish the presidential power excesses and
abuses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>
cited the view of Justice Fernando that people have the right to rebel, and
this would tend to justify exclusion of rebellion and insurrection as
prerequisites to impose martial law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.1<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
opined that the complimentary emergency powers of the President was intended by
the Constitution to allow the President to legislate in the absence of Congress
but qualified this statement by revealing that he has not made deeper studies
along this particular point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
stated that the state has to have power to protect itself from any form of
change other than through constitutional processes and this concept is shared
not only by democratic but by any form of government in existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to Delegate Padua, he suggested to
define what the word rebellion in the provision mean, and the term
"insurrection" should be removed since insurrection is a small
rebellion, which does not merit declaration of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision could well fit in the Bill of
Rights instead as "the State or any portion thereof, may be placed under
martial law only in case <span style="">of </span>actual
invasion or rebellion, when the public safety so requires." Then eliminate
the provision granting power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <span style="">habeas corpus and </span>place the power to
declare martial law among the powers of the President in Section 10, Article
VII, perhaps.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Piit</span>
sought clarification as to the stand of the Senator on the President being
already Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, and is then capable of quelling
rebellion, therefore the power of martial law need not be specified in the
Constitution or that if it has to be, then it has to be in aid to civilian
authorities only. He further sought the Senator's opinion upon whom to lodge
the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, as well
as power to declare martial law, since he is a proponent of a form of
government that would have both a President as head of state and prime minister
as head of government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Senator clarified his statement to
Delegate Barrera that to declare martial law is a recognized power inherent to
the sovereignty of the state and so, need not be mentioned in the Constitution,
a case in point is the United States Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply to the second query, he stressed
that, to him, there should not be such powers lodged on anyone anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if there has to be, the Prime Minister,
since the President is generally ceremonial officer, and would not be kept
abreast officially on every circumstance and happening of the day in the
country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Siguion</span>
Reyna pointed out that from the discussions, it would be safe to assume that
the only thing that matters to an executive when he is allowed to suspend the
privilege of the writ or not, in his equivalent right to arrest and detain
people beyond the statutory requirement. He inquired whether the Senator
entertains the same thinking that the provision has outlived its usefulness since
this provision was established during the days when third degree was accepted
as a means of getting at the truth and confessions from people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of third degree method, there
is nothing to be gained in detaining people unless by the psychological idea
that a detainee would soften to confession, which is unlikely.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11.1<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator explained that the objective of
suspending the privilege of the writ is to hold people <i>i</i><i><span style="">ncommunicado</span></i><span style=""> citing </span>as an example, the Philippines, if it is threatened by a
Red-Chinese invasion and the authorities suspected Mr. Chan, Mr. Tan, etc. to
be spies, then suspension of the privilege of the writ would enable the
government to take immediate hold of Mr. Chan, Mr. Tan and company and keep
them under detention without right to bail This would put them out of
circulation and disable their operations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The justifying reason therefore, lies in the need of the Armed Forces
for essential time to devote on the fight against the invaders or rebels
instead of consuming time to formulate charges against these detainees and the
filing of charges against these detainees can be put aside until such time when
the invasion or rebellion is under control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, it is to enable the Armed Forces to buy essential time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reiterated that power to suspend the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> and power to declare martial law
are justified only on actual invasion or rebellion, and he still maintained
that the former case is unnecessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11.2<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Siguion</span>
Reyna further queried the Senator how the State can meet the security problem
in a case of imminent invasion and the power to suspend the privilege of the
writ is no longer provided for, taking as a case in point, the Philippine
situation during the period prior to the Japanese war when Japanese spies were
all over the country preparing the grounds for its invasion in <span style="">Japan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How can the </span>President or the Prime Minister meet the problem if
he has no power to suspend the privilege of the writ.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">11.3<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
Senator replied <span style="">that in situations like
this, </span>the State should <span style="">undertake surveillance
work </span>as is done in the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
suspects are kept </span>under surveillance and when enough evidence is
acquired the authorities spring the trap on them and bring them to court or in
case the suspect is found operating within an area where an actual fighting is
on, then the commander of the Armed Forces in the area, by virtue of his
inherent military power to restrict movement of civilians in the area can
apprehend and take them to custody until the fight is over without the need for
suspending the privilege of the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is part of military power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He suggested
as an alternative that a degree of flexibility in the manner of legislation can
be resorted to. Citing as an example the legislation on matters of crimes
against the security of the state, detention period prior to filing the case in
court can be enlarged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are laws at
present falling under this category. Wire tapping is unlawful under normal
conditions but it is allowed in cases involving security and rebellion.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">12.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
the follow-up clarification by Chairman De la Serna, the attention of the
Senator was directed back to his former statement that pending the privilege of
the writ only allows the government to hold the detainee <i><span style="">incommunicado</span></i><span style=""> </span>but the detainee has other rights as
the right to communicate with relatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
agreed that the detainee is still entitled to other rights as the right to be
represented by counsel, but once detained, he is subject to restrictions and
control by the jailer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12.2<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate De la Serna asked if there is a
difference in the treatment of detainees when the privilege of the writ is
suspended and detainees arrested when the privilege is not suspended; Whether
to hold a person <i>incommunicado</i>, a jailer is under instruction to impose
certain degree of restrictions to this person which is not true with the
ordinary prisoners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12.3<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
replied that there was really no distinction or difference written in the law
but the jailer, in the exercise of his duty, has a certain degree of unwritten
power over his detainees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator
however disclosed what happened recently to people detained which he experience
as their counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyers were
allowed to talk to the detainees after a number of days had lapsed, and in fact
after their statements were already taken, after the process of interrogations
were terminated. He revealed that he was informed that the detainees were never
harmed nor subjected to physical pressure but the process of interrogation
continued for hours and hours, and even at an unholy hour of <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> they were awakened for further
interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Methods designed to
inflict mental and physical torture to tire out the detainees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>13.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Chair recognized Delegates Molina and <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> who jointly engaged the Senator into a series of
interpellations regarding the Senator's personal opinions and views on the
incumbent President's exercise of his powers (Proclamation 889 and 889-A)
suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>14.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>
asked the Senator if there is no difference between the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Barcelon</span></i></span><i><span style=""> vs. the Baker</span></i><span style=""> case </span>and the <i>Montenegro </i><i><span style="">vs. </span>Castaneda</i> cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>14.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Senator replied that there was a
difference and explained:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) In the
former case, the suspension of the privilege of the writ should not have been
done but it was done only upon joint hearing by the Philippine Commission and
the <span style="">Governor</span>-<span style="">General </span>to grant <span style="">action </span>While in the latter case, the
suspension was the exclusive action of the President of the Philippines. (2)
The situation in the former case were such that at the very beginning our
courts were manned by American Jurists intended to be later on manned by
Filipino Jurists. This being so, the courts found it hard to rule and make a
doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action could be
interpreted as tantamount to allowing Filipino Jurists to overrule an American
Governor General and by implication, overrule the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
since under the Jones Law, the privilege of the writ can be suspended by the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can be <span style="">held </span>later on (today) that the Filipino Supreme Court could
review the findings of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which is impossible under the relation between a colony and its colonizer, and
(3) that the standard of morality and truth were observed with greater fidelity
at that time than they are today.</blockquote>

<blockquote>14.2<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>
sought clarification in the event that the Supreme Court rules that the
anti-subversion law is not a Bill of Attainder, the Senator begged off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that he preferred not to discuss
the details and merits of his position in this case, but strongly urged the
Convention to consider rewriting the provisions on the freedom of association.</blockquote>

<blockquote>15.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
Chair wanted to know whether suspension of the writ and the right to bail is
not suspended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>15.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Senator stated that in his opinion the
right to bail prior to filing the case in court is suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case is filed in court, the custody
of the person accused goes from the executive to the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <span style="">a </span>follow-up
question by the Chairman seeking clarification for the distinction pointed out
by the Senator that right to bail prior to filing the case in court is
suspended, the Senator explained that the provision of the privileged of the
writ consists of the right of a person to be released if the arrest is found
illegal by court, or the detention is arbitrary or in absence of a <i>prima
facie</i> evidence against the person, so if the privilege of the writ is
suspended, it follows that all the other rights are also suspended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>15.2<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Chair sought the view of the Senator on
the opinion of both Secretary <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos and
Solicitor Antonio that during suspension of the privilege of the writ, an order
of warrant of arrest is necessary. Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
agreed with this opinion. The Chair pointed out that if, as the Senator said,
the purpose of the privilege of the writ is to question the legality of arrest
and detention, it could be so, even if there is a valid warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would seem to point out that the
issuance of the warrant of arrest is unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator replied, NO, and pointed out that
if no care can be produced against a person detained, the arrest is unlawful
and the arresting officer is subject to prosecution. The suspension of the
privilege of the writ merely makes it impossible for the courts to order the
release of the detainee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The senator
agreed substantially with the observation of the Chair that this long legal
process required to be followed defeats the very purpose of the suspension of
the privilege of the writ, and stated that this is the reason the executive and
the military authorities resort to illegal shortcuts in taking people into
custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of the detainees today
were not issued legal warrants, but were just invited to the military
headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of these
observations cited, the Senator urged the joint Body to review and rewrite the
provisions on the issuance of warrants of arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>16.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
(d.) engaged the Senator in a series of <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>
questions which delved on points already discussed by the Senator in previous
interpellations by Delegates <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, Barrera, Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Laggui</span> and <span class="SpellE">Siguion</span> Reyna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator however reiterated his statement
that he is for the retention of the exercise of martial law, not that it is
less harmful, but that it is loss subject to abuse than the suspension of the
privilege of the writ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>17.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo's</span>
interpellations were on the subject of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
and validity of Presidential Proclamation as Proclamations No. 889 and
889-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Senator emphasized that the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of proclamations hinges on the time it was made
public, not necessarily though that it be published in the Official Gazette,
nor copies of the contents be furnished the metropolitan newspapers for
publication.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>18.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
categorically answered Delegate Sanchez that he was suggesting a proposal to
totally remove the power to suspend the writ of <span style="">habeas </span>corpus in the proposed Constitution, since being silent
about it will allow Congress or the President to exercise its power of such
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer to Delegate
Calderon (J.), he reiterated that the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> can be exercised with or without being provided for in the
Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>19.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span>
was informed by Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> that those detained
can only apply for bail if a case is filed against a detainee in court, so what
is done is to file a petition for <i>habeas corpus</i>, which includes the
right to bail, if the case is <span class="SpellE">bailable</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>20.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delegate Velez explained that he was
recommending two alternative proposals to the Executive Power Committee:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) to prevent forever the suspension of the
privilege, or <span style="">2) </span>to put
safeguards, meaning the President may suspend it but only in actual cases of
invasion or rebellion for a specific period of time in specific areas where
public safety requires it, with the concurrence of two-thirds vote of the
members of Congress, if in session, and if not, it will be subject to the
automatic review by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>20.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Senator <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> was
in favor of Delegate <span class="SpellE">Veles</span>' first proposal, however,
in the event the thinking of the Convention does not agree, the Senator did not
want to limit the President, or whoever exercises the power to suspend, for a
specific period, because it will be inflexible and meaningless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not agreeable to a concurrence by
Congress because he does not want to tie the hands of the President in cases of
emergency, since it is very hard to muster a quorum in both houses of Congress.
However, he was for its review by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was for the immediate proclamation, but a
limit of time should be set within which, the review should be made.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">20.2<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Delegate
Barrera insisted that the right to protect itself is an inherent sovereign
right of any State, so that for any organization of government to exercise
those means of protection (declaration of martial law and suspension of the
privilege of the writ) should be so stated in the Constitution, and the
necessary, safeguards provided <span style="">for.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

sections, Section <span style="">15 </span>of the Bill
of Rights and Section <span style="">12 </span>of
Article IX, we are, in a way of <span style="">speaking,
</span>remedying the seeming discrepancy between similar provisions in the
present Constitution. Both provisions will now contain the phrase "or in
case of imminent danger thereof". With such a change, I believe <span style="">that no </span>conflict as to the <span style="">true </span>intent will arise in the
future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But allow me, Your Honor, to
recall, briefly, our recent jurisprudence on the matter of the declaration of
martial law and of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i style=""><span style="">habeas
corpus</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Your Honor will recall that under the
Jones Act, the Governor-General of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was given the power to suspend the privilege of the writ of <i style="">habeas corpus</i> and to declare martial
law. When such power was questioned in court, the Supreme Court came out with
the decision, in the case of <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Barcelon</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span><i style=""><span style="">Baker</span></i><span style="">, that </span>the
findings of the Chief Executive on the existence of the grounds for the
declaration of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i style="">habeas corpus</i> are conclusive and may not
be inquired into by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
Philippine Commonwealth was established under the 1935 Constitution, the
President thereof was likewise given the power to suspend the privilege of the
writ of <i style="">habeas corpus</i> and to proclaim
or declare martial law for any of the causes enumerated in the pertinent
provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in the 1950's, then
President <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> suspended the privilege of the writ
of <i><span style="">habeas corpus</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a case arose, that of Montenegro <i style="">vs</i>. Castaneda, the Supreme Court
affirmed its stand in <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i style="">vs</i>. Baker, that the assessment by the Chief Executive of the
existence of the cause or causes giving rise to the proclamation of martial law
or the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is conclusive and may not
be contested in the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recently,
however, only a little less than a year ago, when President Marcos suspended
the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> the Supreme Court ruled, in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i style="">vs</i>. Garcia and other companion cases, that the existence of
insurrection, rebellion, invasion, or imminent danger thereof, may be properly
inquired into by the courts. Now, I would like to pose before this body,
whether this Convention should now affirm the latest doctrine or whether we
should revert to the old theory and doctrine in the two cases of <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i style="">vs</i>.
Baker and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<i style="">vs</i>. Castaneda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE TUPAZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the fact that Chairman de Guzman

Right which conducted an exhaustive Study on this matter of martial law, may I
request that he be the one to answer queries on this point?</blockquote>

<blockquote>CHAIRMAN DE GUZMAN
(A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, may I request
Delegate <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> to act as Chairman in the meantime?</blockquote>

this point, Chairman De Guzman yielded the Chair to Delegate Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>)</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am personally in favor of abandoning the
doctrine laid down in the case of <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i style="">vs</i>. Garcia, and I would recommend such a
view to this Committee, and to the Convention as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this very moment, the Solicitor General,
in representation of President Marcos, is urging the Supreme Court that such a
doctrine be abandoned and that we revert to the old theory laid down in the
cases mentioned by Your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
our courts, especially the Supreme Court, where these cases are invariably
taken up, are ill-equipped to make findings on the existence of rebellion,
insurrection, or lawlessness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But is not Your Honor aware that there are a
number of resolutions filed in the Convention that the Chief Executive may
suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or proclaim and declare
martial law only for a limited period and/or with the concurrence of the
Legislature?</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor, but we are not bound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Committee is not bound by those
resolutions. As already agreed upon when the 166-Man Special Committee was
created, that Committee of which we are a part was merely advised to take into
consideration such resolutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
should bear in mind also that we are adopting the parliamentary system where
there is more, rather than less, fusion of legislative and executive
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are adopting, Your Honor, the
concept and principle of an executive more directly and immediately responsible
to the Legislature so that the exercise by the Chief Executive of any of his
powers will be subject to the ever present scrutiny of the Legislature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my point, Your Honor, is to emphasize the
fact that the filing of those resolutions requiring even the concurrence of the
National Assembly for the valid exercise by the Prime Minister of these
extraordinary constitutional prerogatives indicates that there is a sentiment
among the Delegates to further restrict, rather than expand, the powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I would say that the decision of the
Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i style="">vs</i>. Garcia, which repudiated the doctrine earlier laid down in
Baker and Castaneda lends support to that sentiment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we are to interpret the provision under
consideration in the way Your Honor would want it interpreted, in the sense
that the factual findings of the Chief Executive for the suspension of the
privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or the declaration of martial law
would be conclusive insofar as the judicial Department is concerned, then we
are retrogressing and, in effect, going against the sentiment to further
restrict the exercise of these great constitutional powers.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can go along with Your Honor's argument if,
as I have already stated, this Convention opted for the presidential form of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as we have already opted
and chosen the parliamentary system, I think further restriction on the powers
of the Chief Executive will no longer be justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be trite to repeat here, but I repeat
them nevertheless, the arguments in favor of a parliamentary form of
government:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that this system is for a
strong executive, but one who is immediately and instantly answerable to his
peers at all times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, should a Prime
Minister suspend the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or declare
martial law arbitrarily or, even perhaps, irrationally, I don't think that
there can be any better or more immediate check on such arbitrary and
irrational exercise of power than the Parliament itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts cannot pretend to be in a better
position than the Parliament in this regard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the Parliament on the very day, or perhaps even on the very hour,
that the Prime Minister proclaims martial law or suspends the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> may file a motion to depose him and should this
motion be successful, then the prevailing party with its Prime Minister will
just issue another proclamation restoring normalcy and order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (Q):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you, Your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the moment, Mr. Chairman, I have no more,
questions to ask.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are there any further comments or
interpellations?</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE QUIRINO:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just one question, Mr. Chairman, in
connection with the point raised by Delegate <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You may proceed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE QUIRINO:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I ask my question, Your Honor, let me
state my position clearly lest I be misunderstood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am asking this question not because I
disagree with Your Honor's position but only for the purpose of enriching this
debate with exchanges of views for future researchers and scholars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, if, as Your Honor puts it, the decision
of the Prime Minister on the existence of grounds justifying the declaration of
martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
would no longer be opened to judicial scrutiny, would that not enable the Prime
Minister to abuse his powers?</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor was not listening. I just stated
that there is a more immediate check on the part of the Parliament, and aside
from this practical check, it must be understood that an act of the Chief
Executive suspending the privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> or
proclaiming martial law is a political act and may not therefore be legally
questioned in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being a
political act, the remedy must also be political, in a political forum, be it
in the Parliament or directly before our people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it must be stated that there is no power
which may not be abused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think, Your
Honor, we should once and for all agree as to the nature of this power we are
investing in the Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once
and for all, we should agree that this power is eminently political and
executive in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Judiciary, I
submit, is not the best, much less is it the most practical agency, to possess,
to exercise, or to limit this power, need for which cannot be denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE QUIRINO:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, Your Honor, I am not a lawyer, so I <span style="">hope </span>you will pardon me if I cannot
fully appreciated what you are talking about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, to me, an act is political if it is done by a politician.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PRESIDING OFFICER TOPAZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let's be serious, please.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All right, are there further interpellations
or comments? Yes, Delegate Ortiz, what is it that you want to ask?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">DELEGATE
ORTIZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Well, Mr. Chairman,
this is <span style="">not a </span>question but just
additional observations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
unfortunate really that the doctrine first laid down in <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Barcelon</i></span> <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">vs</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">Baker</span></i><span style=""> </span>and affirmed more than half a century later in Montenegro <i style="">vs</i>. Castaneda was reversed by the
Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Lansang</i></span>
<i style="">vs</i>. <i style="">Garcia</i>, I say it is unfortunate because more than anyone else, only
the President is in the best position to evaluate and assess the existence of
the causes which would warrant the exercise of this constitutional power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it were, the Prime Minister is the head of
the Executive Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than
that, he is the Commander-in-Chief of all the armed forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has, therefore, all the resources and
facilities not available to any other official of the government, much less too
the Supreme Court, to make authoritative findings and assessments of the
threats to national security.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even
in the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> case, I would say that the Court had
to rely on the findings of the Executive Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">I </span>have
here a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court in that case, and I would say
that the Court had to rely on the findings of the Executive Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have here a copy of the decision of the
Supreme Court in that case, and I would like to quote a portion thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this decision, the Supreme court stated,
and I quote:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the year 1969, the NPA had — according to the records of the
Department of National Defense — conducted raids, resorted to kidnapping and
taken part in other violent incidents, summing over <span style="">230, </span>in which it inflicted <span style="">404
</span>casualties and, in turn, suffered <span style="">243
</span>losses. In <span style="">1970, </span>its
record of violent incidents was about the same but the NPA casualties more than
doubled.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I
wish to call the attention of the Members of this Committee to the phrase
appearing in this portion of the court's decision, namely, "according to
the records of the Department of National Defense".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This phrase is, to me, significant in the
sense that even the Supreme Court itself had to rely on the records of an
agency of the Executive Department, which only proves or, at least indicates an
admission on the part of the Court that by itself, it is not in a position to
make its own factual findings on the grounds justifying the suspension of the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, even in the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> case where the Supreme Court repudiated the
conclusiveness of executive findings on facts to justify the exercise of the
power, the same court, nonetheless, had to resort to such findings made by an
arm of the Executive Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I
may further add, I would like to say that, to my recollection, during that
hearing when the Supreme Court received this evidence, or perhaps we may call
them pieces of information, from the military, which information was
classified, there was objections on the part of some counsel who were excluded
from the hearing, to the effect that they should also be afforded the
opportunity of hearing such information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of these, of course, merely show the impracticability on <span style="">the </span>part of any court, be it the
Supreme Court or a lower court, to receive evidence which is, perhaps, not even
acceptable under the Rules of Court and, thereafter, to determine for itself
whether such evidence or information is legally sufficient for the President or
the Prime Minister to act upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
therefore here abandoning the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> doctrine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SOME DELEGATES:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No objection! No objection!</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, it is then the understanding of this <span class="SpellE">Commitee</span>, and I take if to be its position, that when the
Prime Minister suspends the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or declares
martial law, the findings by the Prime Minister on the causes that justify such
suspension or proclamation are conclusive and may not, therefore, be inquired
into by the courts.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May not be inquired into by the courts or by
anyone, and Chief Executive is fully responsible for his acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts, of course, are powerless to take
remedies against any arbitrary acts of the Chief Executive, but such arbitrary
act, if there be any, may be checked by the political branch or department of
the government and, ultimately, by the people themselves.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that is our understanding, Your Honor, why
don't we put it here, in black and white, that the findings of the Prime
Minister on the existence of the grounds for the suspension of the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus or the proclamation of martial law are conclusive
upon the courts?</blockquote>

<blockquote>PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor, I suppose you are aware that we
are here drafting a Constitution and not annotating an existing one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we are to include in this document every
intent and interpretation we have on each provision, I cannot imagine the kind
of bulk of such Constitutional which we shall submit to our people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made that suggestion, Your Honor, because I
want to leave no doubt on our position regarding this point.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I think the records of our
deliberations here would suffice to erase that doubt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, Mr. Chairman, if I may go to another
point, I would like to inquire whether this provision on the powers of the
Chief Executive or the Prime Minister concerning the declaration of martial law
is limited to the quelling or the suppression of rebellion, insurrection, invasion
or lawlessness, or whether such a power includes in it the establishment of a
new order of things, a new society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
say this, Your Honor, because on the evening President Marcos announced the
proclamation of martial law, he underscored his action by saying that he
proclaimed martial law in order, according to him, "to save the Republic
and form a New Society".</blockquote>

<blockquote>PRESIDING OFFICER TUPAZ (A.):. Delegate
De Guzman will please answer that.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question; Your Honor, brings to the fore
the nature and concept of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As it is understood by recognized authorities on the subject, martial
law rests upon the doctrine of paramount necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The controlling consideration, Your Honor, is
necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crucial consideration is
the very existence of the State, the very existence of the Constitution and the
laws upon which depend the rights of the citizens, and the condition of peace
and order so basic to the continued enjoyment of such rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, from this view of the nature of
martial law, the power is to be exercised not only for the more immediate
object of quelling the disturbance or meeting a public peril which, in the
first place, caused the declaration of martial law, but also to prevent the
recurrence of the very causes which necessitated the declaration of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Your Honor, I believe that
when President Marcos, to cite the domestic experience, declared that he
proclaimed Martial law to save the Republic and to form a New Society, he was
stating the full course which martial law must have to take in order to achieve
its rational end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because in the
particular case of the Philippine situation, I agree with the President that it
is not enough that we be able to quell the rebellion and the lawlessness, hut that
we should also be able to eliminate the many ills and evils in society which
have, in the first place, bred and abetted the rebellion and the lawlessness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O):):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I agree with you wholeheartedly, Your
Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems, Your honor, that we are
revolutionizing the traditional concept of martial law which is commonly
understood as a weapon to combat lawlessness and rebellion through the use of
the military authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If my
understanding is correct, Your Honor, martial law is essentially the
substitution of military power for civilian authorities in areas where such
civilian authorities are unable to discharge their functions due to the
disturbed peace and order conditions therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But with your explanation, Your Honor, it seems that the martial law
administrator, ever if he has it the meantime succeeded in quelling the
immediate threats to the security of the state, could take measures no longer
in the form of military operations but essentially and principally of the
nature of ameliorative social action.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor is correct when he said that we are
abandoning the narrow, traditional and classic concept of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we are abandoning the same only to humanize
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Your Honor will recall that the
old concept of martial law is that the law of the camp is the law of the land,
which we are not ready to accept, and President Marcos, aware as he is, that
the Filipino people will not countenance any suppressive and unjust action,
rightly seeks not only to immediately quell and break the back of the rebel
elements but to form a New Society, to create a new atmosphere which will not
be a natural habitat of discontent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>State otherwise, the concept of martial law, as now being practiced, is
not only to restore peace and order in the streets and in the towns but to
remedy the social and political environments, in such a way that discontent
will not once more be renewed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE ORTIZ (R.); I can feel from the
discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Chairman, that we are
having difficulty in trying to ascertain the scope and limitations of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, Mr. Chairman, it is
constitutionally impossible for us to place in this great document, in black
and white, the limits and the extent of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are framing a Constitution and not a
statute and unlike a statute, a Constitution must limit itself to providing
basic concepts and policies without going into details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard from some of the Delegates here
their concern that we might be, by this provision and the interpretations being
given to it, departing from the traditional concept of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concepts are mere concepts, Mr. Chairman, but
concepts, like principles, must be tested by their application to existing
conditions, whether those concepts are contained in statutes or in a
Constitution. Referring specifically to the exercise of his power by President
Marcos, doubts have been expressed in some quarters, whether in declaring
martial law he could exercise legislative <span style="">and
judicial </span>powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would want to
emphasize that the circumstances which provoked the President in declaring
martial law may not be quantified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, it is completely different from a case of invasion where the threat to
national security comes from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The martial law declared by the President was occasioned by the acts of
rebellion, subversion lawlessness and chaos that are widespread in the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their origin, therefore, is
internal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no threat from
without, but only from within.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these
acts of lawlessness, rebellion, and subversion are mere manifestation of more
serious upheavals that beset the deepest core of our social order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we shall limit and constrict martial law
to its traditional concept, in the <span style="">sense
</span>that the military will be merely called upon to discharge civilian
functions in areas where the civil functionaries are not in a position to
perform their normal duties or, better still, to quell lawlessness and restore
peace and order, then martial law would be a mere temporary palliative and we
shall be helpless if bound by the old maxim that martial law is the public law
of military necessity, that necessity calls it forth, that necessity justifies
its existence, and necessity measures the extent and degrees to which it may be
employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My point here, Your Honor, is
that beyond martial necessity lies the graver problem of solving the maladies
which, in the first place, brought about the conditions which precipitated the
exercise of his martial authority, will be limited to merely taking a military
measure to quell the rebellion and eliminating lawlessness in the country and
leave him with no means of authority to effect the needed social and economic
reforms to create an enduring condition of peace and order, then we shall have
failed in providing in this Constitution the basic philosophy of martial law
which.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am sure, we are embodying in it
for the great purpose of preserving the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I say that the preservation of the State is not limited merely to eliminating
the threats that immediately confront it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More than that, the measure to preserve the State must go deeper into
the root causes of the social disorder that endanger the general safety.</blockquote>

would it mean that the Constitution, which authorizes such proclamation, is set

 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution not set aside, but the
operation of some of its provisions <span style="">must,
of necessity, be restricted, if not suspended </span>because their continuance
is inconsistent with the proclamation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, some civil liberties will have
to be suspended upon the proclamation of martial law, not because we do not value
them but simply because it is impossible to implement these civil liberties
hand-in-hand with the effective and successful exercise and implementation of
martial powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are certain
individual rights which must be restricted and curtailed because their exercise
and enjoyment would negate the implementation of martial authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preservation of the State and its
Constitution stands paramount over certain individual rights <span style="">and </span>freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">it </span>were,
the Constitution provides martial law as<span style="">
</span>its weapon for survival and when the occasion arises, when such is at
stake, prudence requires that certain individual rights must have to be
sacrificed temporarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For indeed, the
destruction of the Constitution would mean the destruction of all the rights
that flow from it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does Your Honor mean to say that when martial
law is declared and I, for instance am detained by the military authorities, I
cannot avail of the normal judicial processes to obtain my liberty and question
the legality of my detention?</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I am not mistaken, Your Honor, you are
referring to the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes. Your Honor, that is correct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE DE GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, Your Honor, I take it that when
martial law is proclaimed, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is ipso
facto suspended and, therefore, if you are apprehended and detained by the
military authorities, more so. when your apprehension and detention were for an
offense against the security of the State, then you cannot invoke the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus and ask the courts to order your temporary
release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus, like some other individual rights, must have to yield to the
greater need of preserving the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, we have to make a choice between two values, and I say that in
times of great peril, when the very safety of the whole nation and this
Constitution is at stake, we have to elect for the greater one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">For,
as </span>have said, individual rights assume meaning and importance only when
their exercise could be guaranteed by the State, and such guaranty cannot
definitely be had unless the State is in a position to assert and enforce its
authority.</blockquote>

which are in the nature of statutes, regulating as they do, various and
numerous norms of conduct of both the private and the public sectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would you say, Your Honor, that such exercise

GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, and that is the
position of this Committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As martial
law administrator and by virtue of his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
Forces, the President could exercise legislative and, if I may add, some
judicial powers to meet the martial situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Chief Executive must not be <span class="SpellE">harmstrung</span> or
limited to his traditional powers as Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When martial law, declared, the declaration
gives rise to the birth of powers, not strictly executive in character, but
nonetheless necessary and incident to the assumption of martial law authority
to the end that the State may be safe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE ADIL:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not at all questioning the
constitutionality of the President's assumption of powers which are not
strictly executive in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
I can concede that when martial law is declared, the President can exercise
certain judicial and legislative powers which are essential to or which have to
do with the quelling of rebellion, insurrection, imminent danger thereof, or
meeting an invasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What appears
disturbing to me, and which I want Your Honor to convince me further, is the
exercise and assumption by the President or by the Prime Minister of powers,
either legislative or judicial in character, which have nothing to do with the
conditions of rebellion, insurrection, invasion or imminent danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be more specific.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor, and to cite to you an example, I
have in mind the decree issued by the President proclaiming a nationwide land
reform or declaring land reform throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suppose you will agree with me, Your Honor,
that such a decree, or any similar decree for that matter, has nothing to do
with invasion, insurrection, rebellion or imminent danger thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My point, Your Honor, is that this measure
basically has nothing to do with the restoration of peace and order or the
quelling of rebellion or insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How could we validly say that the President's assumption of such powers
is justified by the proclamation of martial law?</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I have repeatedly stated, Your Honor, we
have now to abandon the traditional concept of martial law as it is understood
in some foreign textbooks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to
look at martial law not as an immutable principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, we must view it in the light of our
contemporary experience and not in isolation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quelling of rebellion or lawlessness or,
in other words, the restoration of peace and order may admittedly be said to be
the immediate objective of martial law, but that is to beg the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For how could there really be an enduring peace
and order if the very causes which spawned the conditions which necessitated
the exercise of martial powers are not remedied? Your cite as an example the
decree on land reform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor will
have to admit that one of the major causes of social unrest among the peasantry
in our society is the deplorable treatment society has given <span style="">to </span>our peasants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as the <span style="">1930's </span>the peasants have been agitating for agrarian reforms to
the extent that during the time of President <span class="SpellE">Qurino</span>
they almost succeeded in overthrowing the government by force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were we to adopt the traditional concept of
martial law, we would be confined to merely putting clown one peasant uprising
after another, leaving unsolved the maladies that in the main brought forth
those uprisings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we are really to
establish an enduring condition of peace and order and assure through the ages
the stability of our Constitution and the Republic, I say that martial law,
being the ultimate weapon of survival provided for in the Constitution, must
penetrate deeper and seek to alleviate and cure the ills and the seething
furies deep in the bowels of the social structure. In a very real sense,
therefore, there is a profound relationship between the exercise by the martial
law administrator of legislative and judicial powers and the ultimate objective
of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I may add that in
the ultimate analysis, the only known limitation to martial law powers is the
convenience of the martial law administrator and the judgment and verdict of
the people and, of course, the verdict of history itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DELEGATE LEVISTE (O.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Honor, just for purposes of discussion,
may I know from you whether there has been an occasion in this country where
any past President had made use of his martial law power?</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:place><st1:city>DELEGATE</st1:city>
 <st1:state>DE</st1:state></st1:place> GUZMAN (A.):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am glad that you asked that question, Your
Honor, because it seems that we are of the impression that since its
incorporation into the <span style="">1935 </span>Constitution
the martial law provision has never been availed of by any President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I recall, Your Honor, that during the
Japanese occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>President Laurel
had occasion to declare martial law he also assumed legislative and judicial
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must, of course, realize that
during the time of President Laurel, the threats to national security which
precipitated the declaration came from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The threats, therefore, were not internal in
origin and character as those which prompted President Marcos to issue his
historic proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, in case — as
what happened <span style="">during the time of
President Laurel — the declaration </span>of martial law necessitated the
exercise of legislative powers by the martial law administrator, I say that
greater necessity calls forth the exercise of that power when the threats to
national security are posed not by invaders but by the rebellious and seditious
elements both of the left and right, from within.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say that because every rebellion, whether
in this country or in other foreign countries, is usually the product of social
unrest and dissatisfaction with the established order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebellions or the acts of rebellion are
usually preceded by long suffering of those who ultimately choose to rise in
arms against the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rebellion
is not born overnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the result
of an accumulation of social sufferings on the part of the rebels until they can
no longer stand those sufferings to the point that, like a volcano, it must
sooner erupt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this context, the
stamping out of rebellion must not be the main and only objective of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Martial law administrator
should, nay, must, take steps to remedy the crisis that lie behind the
rebellious movement, even if in the process, he should exercise legislative and
judicial powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what benefit would
it be after having put down a rebellion through the exercise of martial power
if another rebellion is again the offing because the root causes which
propelled the movement are ever present? One might succeed in capturing the
rebel leaders and their followers, imprison them for life or, better skill,
kill them in the field, but someday new leaders will pick up the torch and the
tattered banners and lead another movement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Great causes of every human undertaking do not usually die with the men
behind those causes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless the root
causes are themselves eliminated, there will be a resurgence of another
rebellion and, logically, the endless and vicious exercise of martial law
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This reminds me of the wise
words of an old man in our town:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That if
you are going to clear your field of weeds and grasses, you should not merely
cut them, but dig them out.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is for the foregoing <span style="">reasons
that I find continued </span>martial law to be a political <span style="">question under the new </span>Charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present Constitution <span style="">does not give the </span>Supreme Court any
power to check the exercise of a supremely political prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there <span style="">is </span>any checking or review of martial law, the Constitution gives
it, not to the Supreme Court, but to the National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the checking function is vested
in the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the National
Assembly expresses displeasure and withdraw its confidence from the Prime
Minister through election of a successor or the Prime Minister asks the
President to dissolve the National Assembly under Article VIII<span style="">, </span>Section <span style="">13, </span>the issue of martial law ultimately rests with the
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anything dependent upon the
popular will is, of course political.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the interim National Assembly has not yet been convened, the
intent of the Constitutional Convention to make the question political is
clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exclusive of the Transitory Provisions, other provisions of the
present Charter may be cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bill
of Rights, Article IV, Section <span style="">15 </span>had
added "or imminent danger thereof" to the <span style="">1935 provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It now
reads —</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion,
insurrection, rebellion, <i>or</i> <i>imminent danger thereof</i>, when the
public safety requires it.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article IX, Section 16, another new provision reads--</p>

deemed, and are hereby, vested in the Prime Minister, unless the National

</span>Correctness of the President's acts, I must repeat, is not the

arbitrariness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from asserting that there was no basis for the initial
proclamation of martial law, the petitioners insist there is no real emergency

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> cites various newspaper

that reservists won't undergo combat duty, statements of Defense Secretary

that the rebel backbone is broken. (Supplemental Petition and Motion for

<p class="BODY">The petitioners assert that the "actual state of war"
aspect was dropped from general orders as early as <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1972</st1:date> and that the transformation of
a New Society has become the new theme.</p>

a semantic manipulation, namely, that the building of a New Society is the only
way of saving the Republic.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a Manifestation dated <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1974</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> cites other
circumstances showing that peace and order conditions in the country are
normal.</p>

left the country a few weeks ago for a meeting at <span class="SpellE">Menado</span>
with President <span class="SpellE">Suharto</span> of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
something he obviously would not have done if there really was an emergency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Tourists and
foreign investors are coming to our shores in hordes, not just to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
but also its environs and outlaying provinces, which they would certainly not
do if they were not assured of security stability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basketball, chess, swimming and even karate
international tournaments are being held in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President even attended the latter event.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1974 Miss Universe contest is scheduled to
be held in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> this month with
expenses in preparation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> amounting to million
of pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government would not have
been so thoughtless as to spend so much money for such an unnecessary affair,
if there is really an "actual and imminent danger of insurrection and
rebellion."</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the proclamation of martial law, the
Philippines has hosted several international conference the latest being the
United Nations Development Program session which were attended by delegates and
observers from sixty-six (66) countries, twenty-six (26) United Nations
Agencies, and the U.N.D.P. Secretariat. The event last mentioned brought in so
many visitors that facilities of no less than fourteen (14) hotels had to be
utilized. This can only happen in a country where peace and tranquility
prevail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These circumstances, — some bordering on the frivolous, <i>coupled
with the President's clear and repeated assurance that there is "no real
emergency today" (Daily Express, June 22, 1973) and that "actually We
have removed" martial law </i>(Time Magazine, April 15,1974) —all confirm
that the conditions under which "persons may be detained without warrant
but with due process" (to use the quotation from petitioner's cited by
respondents), no longer exist, if indeed they ever existed, and that,
therefore, the power of indefinite detention claimed by the Solicitor General
and the respondents for the President in their last two pleadings, is actually
and patently "beyond the pale of the law because it is <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the human rights guaranteed by the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While I believe that the continuation of a state of martial law
is a political question under the new Constitution, these arguments deserve
answer for the sake of our people who will read the Court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am not convinced, at this stage of martial law, that the
President is acting arbitrarily in not lifting the proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A Manifestation dated <st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1974</st1:date> from the respondents states:</p>

<blockquote>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the President's constitutional
powers, functions, and responsibilities in a state of martial law, he
periodically requires to he conducted a continuing assessment of the factual
situation which necessitated the promulgation of Proclamation No. 1081 on
September 21, 1972 and the continuation of martial law through Proclamation
No.1104, dated January 17, 1973.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Government's current and latest
assessment of the situation including evidence of the subversive activities of
various groups and individuals, indicates that there are still pockets of
actual armed insurrection and rebellion in certain parts of the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in the major areas of the active
rebellion the military challenge to the Republic and its duly constituted Government
has been overcome and effective steps have been and are being taken to redress
the centuries-old and deep-seated causes upon which the fires of insurrection
and rebellion have fed, the essential process <span style="">of </span>rehabilitation and renascence is a slow and delicate
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of said current
assessment and of consultations with the people, the President believes that
the exigencies of the situation, the continued threat to peace, order, and
security the dangers to stable government and to democratic processes and
institutions, the requirements of public safety, and the actual and imminent
danger of insurrection and rebellion all require the continuation of the
exercise of powers incident to martial law:</blockquote>

<blockquote>c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of persons who had to be detained
upon the proclamation of martial law have been released and are now engaged in
their normal pursuits. However, the President has deemed that, considering the
overall situation described above and in view of adequate evidence which can
not now be declassified, the continued detention of certain individuals without
the filing of formal charges in court for subversive and other criminal acts is
necessary in the interest of national security and defense to enable the
Government to successfully meet the grave threats of rebellion and
insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the
Secretary of National Defense and his authorized representatives have acted in
accordance with guidelines relating to national security which the President
has prescribed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The President believes that the continued threat <span style="">to </span>peace and order, the dangers to
stable government and democratic institutions and the actual and imminent
danger of insurrection and rebellion require continuation of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding is based on a continuing assessment
of the factual situation which resulted in Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, petitioners believe
otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the exercise of judicial review, one reasonable mind assessing
the factual situation now obtaining could probably agree with the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another reasonable mind,
however, viewing the same factual situation could very understandably arrive at
an opposite conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming We have
the power, We should not try to weigh evidence on either side and determine who
is correct and who is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
earlier, the test of validity is arbitrariness and not correctness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not doubt the President's sincerity and
good faith in making the determination outlined in the respondent's
Manifestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can, therefore, be
no finding that he is acting arbitrarily in not lifting martial law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The "evidence" presented by petitioner <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Diokno</span></span><span style=""> </span>weakens his arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as he claims, the mass media are
controlled, the news items on rebellion that he cites should not be accorded
strong probative value. It <span style="">is </span>possible
that the news about rebels and insurrectionist activities is deliberately
played down as part of the peace and order campaign under Martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
news </span>could be intended to convince those who may waver between seeking
amnesty or prolonging the rebellion to take the first course of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, there is overwhelming a greater number of reasonable men
and women who agree with the President's findings than with the petitioners'
convictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1973</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1973</st1:date>, voters in a national referendum were asked
— Do you want President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the reforms
he has initiated under martial law? The Commission on Elections has reported
that 18,505,216 voters answered "Yes" and 1,858,744 voted
"No".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vote of the
18,505.216 people from all parts of the country who answered "Yes"
can clearly be interpreted as sustaining the finding that the President is not
acting arbitrarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it can be
read in no other way but <span style="">to </span>confirm
even the correctness of the President's determination on the continuing need
for martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since other
referendum are forthcoming, a more reliable gauge of arbitrariness and
correctness than press clippings is available to our people as they judge the
President.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in urging this Court to decide the petitions and
to decide them in their favor, raise the alarm that unless We do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may never be able to decide at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are warned that "in the face of an
assault on the judiciary, it would be ridiculous, if it were not tragic, if
this Court did not even so much as defend itself . . . In the face of a
dismantling of the entire constitutional order of which the judiciary is a
vital, indispensable part, how can it even afford the luxury of acquiescence in
its own ruin?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And now can it continue <span style="">to </span>inspire the high respect of the
people, if it merely indulges in sculptured rhetoric and fails to protect their
civil liberties in live, concrete petitions such an this?" (Reply
Memorandum for Petitioners dated November 30, 1972, page 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners speak of "constitutional
suicide" (ibid. p. 60) and allege that "the gloom deepens and is
encircling, and only a few lights remain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One remaining light is that provided by this Supreme Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire nation now looks in its direction
and prayerfully hopes it will continue burning" <span style="">(ibid. p. </span>81).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I </span>do not share the

</span>My decision is based not alone on my sincere conviction about what the
Constitution commands and what the relevant constitutional provisions
mean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Happily, my reading of the
Constitution as a legal document coincides with what I feel is right, morally
and conscience-wise, for our country and people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It confirms my life-long conviction that there
is indeed wisdom, profundity and even genius in the seemingly short and
uncomplicated provisions of our fundamental law.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">MARTIAL LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF <span style="">THE WRIT </span>OF HABEAS CORPUS</p>

<p class="BODY">Another issue in the instant petitions is whether the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended upon a proclamation of martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is obviously in the
affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proclamation of martial law is conditioned on the occurrence
of the gravest contingencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
exercise of a more absolute power necessarily includes the lesser power
especially where it is needed to make the first power effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The suspension enables the executive,
without interference from the courts or the law, to arrest and imprison persons
against whom no legal crime can be proved, but who may, nevertheless. be
effectively engaged in forming the rebellion or inviting the invasion, to the
imminent danger of the public safety." (<span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span>
<i>vs</i>. Baker, 5 Phil. 87. 112).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>would negate the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of martial law if detainees could <span style="">go </span>to the courts and ask for release
under the same grounds and following the same procedure obtaining in normal
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> paragraph of Proclamation No. 1081 ordered that
all persons presently detained or others who may thereafter be similarly
detained for the crimes of insurrection and rebellion and all other crimes and
offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion or in connection therewith
shall be kept under detention until otherwise ordered released by him or his
duly designated representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
General Order No. 2-A, the President ordered the arrest and taking into custody
of certain individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>General Order
No. 2-A directs that these arrested individuals will be held in custody until
otherwise ordered <span style="">by </span>the
President or his duly designated representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These general orders clearly show that the
President was precluding court examination into these specified arrest and
court orders directing release of detained individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial law is intended to overcome the
dangers from rebellion or insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose would be subverted if martial law is declared and yet
individuals committing acts of direct rebellion and insurrection or acts which
further the goals of the rebels cannot be detained without filing charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the President decides to proclaim martial
law and to use all the military forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to preserve the Republic and safeguard the interests of the people, it is
sophistry to slate that the lesser power of suspending the privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is not included.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is especially true where, as in these cases, the President has
specifically ordered the detention without filing of charges of individuals who
further or might further the rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This appears clear from Proclamation No. 1081 itself and from pertinent
general orders issued pursuant to it.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">THE EFFECT OF ARTICLE XVII, SEC. <span style="">3 </span>(2) OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION</p>

by the express words of the Constitution, part of the law of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the transitory provision considers
them valid, legal, binding and effective even after lifting of martial law or
the ratification of this Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are valid not only at the inception of but also during martial
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only an express and explicit
modification or repeal by the regular National Assembly may modify, revoke, and
supersede the proclamation orders, decrees, instructions or other acts of the
incumbent President under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This transitory provision does not, as many people believe, merely
validate Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
section confirms the validity of the proclamation under the old Constitution
and its continuing validity under the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitutional Convention concurred with
the President and declared that the proclamation was validly issued under the
old Charter and continues to be constitutional under the new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the constitutional provision
alone, the declaration of martial law under Proclamation No. 1081 may,
therefore, be justified and validated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, the orders of the President on the continued detention of the
petitioners and, in effect, the suspension of the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus have been definitely declared valid and constitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">I wish to add that with the above-cited portion of <span style="">t</span>he Transitory Provision, the
Constitutional Convention wanted to foreclose any constitutional attack on the
validity of "all proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, and acts
promulgated, issued, or done by the incumbent President" mentioned
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, during the
discussion of this portion of the Transitory Provision before the 166-man
special committee, formed to finally draft the Constitution of which I was a
member, (being the Vice-Chairman of the panel of floor leaders), answering a
query from Delegate <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>, Delegate <span class="SpellE">Pacificador</span> said:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">TRANSCRIPT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 166-MAN<br>
SPECIAL COMMITTEE — MEETING NO. <span style="">33<br>
</span><st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="11">NOVEMBER 26, 1972</st1:date></p>

<blockquote>"By the provisions of Subsection <span style="">2, </span>we are rendering the decrees of the incumbent President as
more than mere statutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
constituting them as highly political acts, the validity of which cannot be
inquired into even by our courts, but are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
only to the people themselves. There <span style="">will
</span>be no other way of revoking or repealing such decrees except by the two
ways mentioned in Subsection 2 of Section 3."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Justifying martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus by citing the transitory provisions of the present
Constitution leads to another argument in the petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>,
the statements in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
decision in the ratification cases that "there is no further judicial
obstacle to the new Constitution being considered in force and effect" is
clearly, not a ruling that the New Constitution is legally in force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>
stresses how carefully the Court, has chosen its language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him, the Court does not say that
there is no further legal obstacle and that it says merely that there is no
further judicial obstacle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Petitioner </span>finds a world of difference
between a <i>legal</i> and a <i>judicial</i> obstacle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every illegal act, according to him, is <i><span style="">per se </span></i>barred by a legal obstacle
but not necessarily by a judicial obstacle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner points out that the Court does not state that the new
Constitution is in force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely
speaks of the new Constitution <i>being </i><i><span style="">considered</span></i><span style=""> </span>in
force and in effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleges that
between "being" and "being considered", there is again a
world of difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the decision
of the Supreme Court in the ratification cases, the petitioner believes that
the Court was trying to make it as plain as circumstances permitted that it had
not decided that the new Constitution is legally and factually in force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other pleadings submitted in these cases have raised basically
the same major issues that were raised in the ratification cases already
decided by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">To my mind, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the Supreme Court's decision is best interpreted by the Supreme Court
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No amount of argumentation,
submission of pleadings, play of words, and semantic niceties can overcome or
ignore the fact that the Supreme Court is interpreting and applying the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members have taken an
oath to defend this new Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
both action and words, all the members of this Court have made it plain beyond
any shadow of doubt that the new Constitution is legally and factually in
force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The justices of this Court would
be the last persons to interpret and enforce something they do not consider
valid, legitimate, and effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not alone the taking of an oath to support and defend the new constitution that
indicates clearly what the Court meant then it rendered the <span class="SpellE"><i>Javellana</i></span><i>
vs. Executive Secretary</i> L-36142 decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The meaning of the decision is quite the fact that the Court has been
enlarged beyond its earlier composition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has reorganized itself into two divisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each division is now trying cases pursuant to
the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All courts are
under the administrative supervision of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination decisions rendered by the
Court since the <span class="SpellE"><i>Javellana</i></span><i> vs. Executive
Secretary</i> decision will show that there is constant reference to the 1973
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its provisions form the
basis for its authority to interpret and expound on the laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever a provision of the Constitution is
invoked, the Court turns to the 1973 Constitution as the present
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can see no clearer
interpretation of a decision of this Court than these various acts of the Court
itself.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XVII </p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">A FEW OTHER POINTS</p>

<p class="BODY">There are a few other points which I would like to answer
briefly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Francisco
"Soc" Rodrigo states that while he was released from detention on <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1972</st1:date>, his release <span style="">is </span>conditional and subject to some
restrictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not allowed to leave
the confines of the Greater Manila area unless specifically authorized by the
military.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He states that his petition
for habeas corpus is not moot and academic because of his release.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering my <span style="">opinion on
</span>the constitutionality <span style="">of </span>Proclamation
No. 1081, it follows that the release <span style="">of
</span>petitioners Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> may not
ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitions for their
release, as in the case of detainees already released, must be directed to the
President.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> If such is the case with petitioners who are
actually detained and confined, with more reason should the principles herein
enunciated apply to those no longer confined or detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of former Senator <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, criminal charges have been filed against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a rule a petition for the wr<span style="">it</span> of habeas corpus is satisfactorily
answered by a showing that a prisoner is detained on the basis of valid
criminal charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> challenges the jurisdiction of the military tribunal
and the validity of the charges against <span style="">him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, insofar as all issues in the case of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> <i>vs</i>.
Military Commission No. 2. L-37364, which <span style="">a</span>re
common to the issues in these instant petition are concerned, this decision
applies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On any other issued not common
to the issues in these Petitions, I am reserving my opinion for L-37364.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XVIII</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">THE REMEDIES AGAINST CLEAR ABUSE OF POWER</p>

<p class="BODY">The general remedy against an arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious
exercise of the martial law power of the President, as it is the remedy on all
political questions, is the voice of the people in the election when one is
held, or through the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> which the President
himself has consulted in the July 27 and 28, 1973 referendum on whether the
people wanted President Marcos to continue beyond 1973 and finish the reforms
he has initiated under <span class="SpellE">marcial</span> law. The President has
officially announced a number of times that he would consult with the <span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> periodically.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under this remedy, the people, in the exercise of their sovereign power,
can base their decision, not only on whether the acts of the President has been
arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious; they can base their decision on a broader
basis — and that is whether, in their own opinion, the President acted
correctly or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Or if and when the interim assembly is convened, a majority of
the members thereof, as representatives of the people, can also remedy an
arbitrary, whimsical, capricious, or even an unwise exercise of the power, by
so advising the Prime Minister to lift martial law under pain of being deposed
as Prime Minister.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we declare the proclamation and the continuation of martial
law political and therefore <span class="SpellE">nonjusticiable</span> in nature,
We are only acknowledging the constitutional limitation of<span style=""> </span>that power to <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
questions only, just as we had defined the constitutional limitations of the
powers of Congress and of the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the interpreter of the Constitution, the Court has to lead in
respecting its boundaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our jurisprudence is replete with examples where this Court
exercised its judicial power in appropriate cases (<span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, 83 Phil. 17; <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
<i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> 84 Phil. 386; <span class="SpellE">Nationalista</span> Party <i>vs</i>. Bautista, 85 Phil. 101;
Rodriguez <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Gella</span>, 92 Phil. 603; <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span> <i><span style="">vs</span></i><span style="">. </span>Esteban, 93 Phil. 68; <span class="SpellE">Aytona</span> <i>vs</i>. Castillo, 4 SCRA 533, to name only the
few), which should more than prove that no matter how grave or urgent, delicate
or formidable and novel or uncommon a legal problem is, the Court will know
when and how to resolve it. Specifically, it will know what to do if, as
petitioners fear, a President may someday wake up and out of the blue proclaim
martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, this is already
almost an impossibility under the parliamentary system established by the New
Constitution.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XIX</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">C O N C L U S I O N</p>

<p class="BODY">The voluminous pleadings and the lengthy arguments supporting the
petitions are generally couched in erudite and eloquent language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is regrettable that they have been tainted
in a number of instances with frenzied and biting statements indicative a sense
of exasperation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am certain, however,
that these statements cannot affect the high sense of impartiality of the
members of the Court as they giv<span style="">e</span>
their opinion in these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The President is the highest elective official in the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was no casual or perfunctory
choice which elevated him to the position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is his duty, no less than that of this Court, to save the Republic
from the perils of rebellion and insurrection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order to preserve public safety and good order, he has been forced to
proclaim a state of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
insure the continuation of civilian authority and democratic institutions, he
has utilized the armed forces to quell the armed challenge and to remedy the
ancient evils upon which rebellion and insurrection flourish.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners dispute the President's determination and
question his motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To them the
exercise of his constitutional powers is an abuse of executive powers and
assumption of a dictatorship. Inasmuch as the real reason for the imposition of
martial law, according to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, is not
to preserve the nation but to keep the President in power, there is only one
decision the Court should make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should invalidate Proclamation No. 1081.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dire consequences are given by the petitioner-eventual resort to
arms, shedding of blood, destruction of property and irreparable loss of
invaluable lives — which, of course are the same consequences sought to be
avoided when martial law was proclaimed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court may be the highest court of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not, however, a super Being over and
above the Executive, the Legislature and the Constitution, deciding cases on an
infallible sense of Truth and a faculty of divination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Principles of liberty, right, and justice are
not interpreted in an abstract and dogmatic form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are applied in the manner the sovereign
people adopted our institutions of government and formulated our written
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court can rule on the proclamation of martial law
only insofar as its validity under the Constitution is raised as an issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Constitution, the expression of
sovereign will, vests the determination of the necessity for martial law in the
President the Court shall so declare and respect it.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the determination of the wisdom of the propriety of the
proclamation must rest with the people. Wisdom and propriety in the making of
supremely political decisions and in the exercise of political functions are
for the people to assess and determine. Under our constitutional form of
government, no official or department can effectively exercise a power unless
the people support it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Review by the
people may not be as <span class="SpellE">clearcut</span> and frequent as
judicial review but it is actual, present, and most effective.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>constitutional
process and the rule of law are <span style="">interpreted
and </span>enforced by the Supreme Court but then viability and strength depend
on the support and faith of the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, if our people allow the <span style="">system </span>of government to be changed, no pronouncement of this
Court can reverse the change or topple an alleged dictator from power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the people can do it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fortunately, the trend of present events clearly shows that
martial law instead of destroying constitutional government as advanced by the
petitioners, is, in fact, saving and strengthening it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to render judgment.</p>

motion to withdraw his petition for habeas corpus,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Declaring that the decision proclaim martial

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue involved in these habeas corpus petitions is the
pre-eminent problem of the times — the primacy to be accorded the claims of
liberty during periods of crisis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
much that is novel in what confronts the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A traditional orientation may not suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The approach taken cannot be characterized by
rigidity and inflexibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
room, plenty of it, for novelty and innovation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Doctrines deeply rooted in the past, that have stood the test of time
and circumstance, must be made adaptable to present needs and, hopefully,
serviceable to an unknown future, the events of which, to recall Story, are
locked up in the inscrutable designs of a merciful <st1:city><st1:place>Providence</st1:place></st1:city>.
It is essential then that in the consideration of the petitions before us there
be objectivity, calmness, and understanding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The deeper the disturbance in the atmosphere of security, the more
compelling is the need for tranquility of mind, if reason is to prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No legal barrier is to be interposed to
thwart the efforts of the Executive to restore normalcy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not to be denied the power to take what
for him may be necessary measures to meet emergency conditions. So the
realities of the situation dictate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There should be on the part of the judiciary then, sensitivity to the
social forces at work; creating conditions of grave unrest and turbulence and
threatening the very stability, not to say existence, of the political
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in that setting that the
crucial, issue posed by these petitions is to be appraised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that this clash between the primacy
of liberty and the legitimate defense of authority is not susceptible of any
definite, <span class="SpellE">clearcut</span> solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless; an attempt has to be made. With
all due recognition of the merit apparent in the exhaustive, scholarly and
eloquent dissertations of Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and my
other brethren as well as the ease and lucidity with which the Chief Justice
clarified the complex issues and the views of members of the Court, I would
like to give a brief expression to my thoughts to render clear the points on
which I find myself, with regret, unable to be of the same persuasion.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. solely on
the ground that charges had been filed, and dissent in part in the dismissal of
the petition of Francisco Rodrigo and others,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
who joined him in his plea for the removal of the conditions on their release,
on the view that as far as freedom of travel is concerned, it should be, on
principle, left unrestricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
originally prepared, this opinion likewise explained his dissent in the denial
of the motion to withdraw in the petition filed on behalf of Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>, a matter now moot and academic.</p>

<blockquote>1. We have to pass on habeas corpus petitions. The great writ of
liberty is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rightfully, it is
latitudinarian in scope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
wide-ranging and all-embracing in its reach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can dig deep into the facts to assure that there be no toleration of
illegal restraint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Detention must be for
a cause recognized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ
imposes on the judiciary the grave responsibility of ascertaining whether a
deprivation of physical freedom is warranted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The party who is keeping a person in custody has to produce him in court
as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, he
must justify the action taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only if
it can be demonstrated that there has been no violation of one's right to
liberty will he be absolved from responsibility. Failing that, the confinement
must thereby cease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it suffice
that there be a court process, order, or decision on which it is made to
rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there be a showing of a
violation of constitutional rights, the jurisdiction of the tribunal issuing it
is ousted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even if there be a
valid sentence, it cannot, even for a moment, be extended beyond the period
provided for by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When that time
comes, he is entitled to be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is in that sense then, as so well put by Holmes, that this great writ "is
the usual remedy for unlawful imprisonment."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It does afford, to borrow from the language of <st1:place>Birkenhead</st1:place>,
"a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or
confinement."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Not that there is need for actual incarceration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A custody for which there is no support in
law suffices for its invocation. The party proceeded against is usually a
public official, the run-of-the-mill petitions often coming from individuals
who for one reason or another have run afoul of the penal laws. Confinement
could likewise come about because of contempt citations,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
whether from the judiciary or from the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could also be due to statutory commands,
whether addressed to cultural minorities<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
or to persons diseased.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, too, this proceeding could be availed of by citizens subjected to
military discipline<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as aliens seeking entry into or to be deported from the country.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Even those outside the government service may be made to account for their
action as in the case of wives restrained by their husbands or children
withheld from the proper parent or guardian.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It is thus apparent that any deviation from the legal norms calls for the
restoration of freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be sheer mockery of
all that such a legal order stands for, if any person's right to live and work
where he is minded to move about freely, and to be rid of any unwarranted fears
that he would just be picked up and detained, is not accorded full
respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The significance of the writ
then for a regime of liberty cannot be overemphasized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Nor does the fact that, at the time of the filing of these
petitions martial law had been declared, call for a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is of course imparted to the matter a
higher degree of complexity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it
cannot be gainsaid that the reasonable assumption is that the President
exercised such an awesome power one granted admittedly to cope with an
emergency or crisis situation, because in his judgment the situation as thus
revealed to him left him with no choice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the President did attested to an executive determination of the
existence of the conditions that called for such a move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, in his opinion, an insurrection or
rebellion of such magnitude that public safety did require placing the country
under martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That decision was his
to make; it is not for the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The assessment thus made, for all the sympathetic consideration it is
entitled to, is not, however, impressed with finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has a limited sphere of
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, for me, is the teaching
of Lansang.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a>
The judicial role is difficult, but it is unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writ of liberty has been invoked by
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must be heard, and we
must rule on their petitions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. This Court has to act then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The liberty enshrined in the Constitution, for the protection of which
habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy, imposes that obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its task is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a trust to which it cannot be
recreant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever the grievance
complained of is deprivation of liberty, it is its responsibility to inquire
into the matter and to render the decision appropriate under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, a habeas
corpus petition calls for that response.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the significance of liberty in a constitutional regime cannot be
sufficiently stressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness these
words from the then Justice, later Chief Justice, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Furthermore, individual freedom is too
basic, too transcendental and vital in a republican state, like ours, to be
denied upon mere general principles and abstract consideration of public
safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the preservation of
liberty is such a major preoccupation of our political system that, not
satisfied with guaranteeing its enjoyment in the very first paragraph of section
(1) of the Bill of Rights, the framers of our Constitution devoted [twelve
other] paragraphs [thereof] to the protection of several aspects of
freedom."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>
A similar sentiment was given expression by the then Justice, later Chief
Justice, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Let the rebels have no reason to apprehend that their comrades now
under custody are being railroaded into <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>
without benefit of those fundamental privileges which the experience of the
ages has deemed essential for the protection of all persons accused of crime

them the assurance that the judiciary, ever mindful of its sacred mission will
not, thru faulty cogitation or misplaced devotion, uphold any doubtful claims
of Governmental power in diminution of individual rights, but will always cling
to the principle uttered long ago by Chief Justice Marshall that when in doubt
as to the construction of the Constitution, 'the Courts will favor personal
liberty' . . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> The pertinence of the above
excerpt becomes quite manifest when it is recalled that its utterance was in
connection with a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding where the precise point at issue
was whether or not the right to bail could be availed of when the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus was suspended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no decisive outcome, although there were five votes in favor
of an affirmative answer to only four against.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> Such pronouncements in cases
arising under the 1935 Constitution should occasion no surprise. They merely
underscore what was so vigorously emphasized by the then Delegate. Jose P. Laurel,
Chairman of the Committee on the Bill of Rights, in his sponsorship address of
the draft provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The history of the world is the history
of man and his arduous struggle for liberty. ... It is the history of those
brave and able souls who, in the ages that are past, have labored, fought and
bled that the government of the lash — that symbol of slavery and despotism —
might endure no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the history
of those great self-sacrificing men who lived and suffered in an age of
cruelty, pain and desolation so that every man might stand, under the
protection of great rights and privileges, the equal of every other man."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a>
So should it be under the present Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No less a person than President Marcos during the early months of the
1971 Constitutional Convention categorically affirmed in his <i>Today's
Revolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Democracy</i>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Without freedom, the whole concept of
democracy falls apart."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a> Such a View has support in
history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A statement from Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> has a contemporary ring:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Give liberties, so that no one may have
a right to conspire."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>

<blockquote>4. Equally so, the decisive issue is one of liberty not only
because of the nature of the petitions, but also because that is the mandate of
the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is its
philosophy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a regime of liberty to
which our people are so deeply and firmly committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a>
The fate of the individual petitioners hangs in the balance. That is of great
concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is at stake, however, is
more than that — much more. There is a paramount public interest involved. The
momentous question is how far in times of stress fidelity can be manifested to
the claims of liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is ordained
by the Constitution, and it is the highest law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be obeyed. Nor does it make a crucial difference, to my mind,
that martial law exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may call for
a more cautious approach. The simplicity of constitutional fundamentalism may
not suffice for the complex problems of the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, the duty remains to assure that the
supremacy of the Constitution is upheld.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether in good times or bad, it must be accorded the utmost respect and
deference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is what
constitutionalism connotes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, its
distinctive characteristic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Greater
restraints may, of course, be imposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Detention, to cite the obvious example, is not ruled out under martial
law, but even the very proclamation thereof is dependent on public safety'
making it imperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The powers, rather
expansive, perhaps at times even latitudinarian, allowable the administration
under its aegis, with the consequent diminution of the sphere of liberty, are
justified only under the assumption that thereby the beleaguered state is in a
better position to protect, defend and preserve itself. They are hardly
impressed with the element of permanence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They cannot endure longer than the emergency that called for the
executive having to make use of this extraordinary prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it is a thing of the past, martial law
must be at an end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no more reason
for being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If its proclamation is open
to objection or its continuance no longer warranted, there is all the more
reason, to follow <span class="SpellE">Laski</span>, to respect the traditional
limitation of legal authority that freedom demands.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
With these habeas corpus petitions precisely rendering peremptory action by
this Court, there is the opportunity for the assessment of liberty considered
in a concrete social context. With full appreciation then of the complexities
of this era of turmoil and disquiet, it can hopefully contribute to the
delineation of constitutional boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may even be able to demonstrate that law can be timeless and yet
timely.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. There arc relevant questions that still remain to be
answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does not the proclamation of
martial law carry with it the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so, should not the principle
above enunciated be subjected to further refinement?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not too certain that the first query
necessarily calls for an affirmative answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Preventive detention is of course allowable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Individuals who are linked with invasion or
rebellion may pose a danger to the public safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing inherently unreasonable in
their being confined. Moreover, where it is the President himself, as in the
case of these petitioners, who personally 'directed that they be taken in, it
is not easy to impute arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may happen though that officers 'of lesser stature not impressed with the high
sense of responsibility would utilize the situation to cause the apprehension
of persons without sufficient justification. Certainly it would be, to my mind,
to sanction oppressive acts if the validity of such detention cannot be
inquired into through habeas corpus petitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is more than just desirable therefore that if such be the intent,
there be a specific decree concerning the suspension of the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then,
however, such proclamation could be challenged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If vitiated by constitutional infirmity, the release may be ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it were otherwise, the applicant may
not be among those as to whom the privilege of the writ has been
suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pertinent to note in
this connection that Proclamation No. 1081 specifically states "that all
persons presently detained, as well as all others who may hereafter be similarly
detained for the crimes of insurrection or rebellion, and all other crimes and
offenses committed in furtherance or on the occasion thereof, or incident
thereto, or in connection therewith, for crimes against national security and
the law of nations, crimes against the fundamental laws of the State, crimes
against public order, crimes involving usurpation of authority, rank, title and
improper use of names, uniforms and insignia, crimes committed by public
officers, and for such other crimes as will be enumerated in Orders that I
shall subsequently promulgate, as well as crimes as a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>consequence of any violation of any decree,
order or regulation promulgated by me personally or promulgated upon my
direction shall be kept under detention until otherwise ordered released by me
or by my duly designated representative."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a> The implication appears to be that
unless the individual detained is included among those to whom any of the above
crimes or offenses may be imputed, he is entitled to judicial protection.
Lastly, the question of whether or not there is warrant for the view that
martial law is at an end may be deemed proper not only in the light of
radically altered conditions but also because of certain executive acts clearly
incompatible with its continued existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under such circumstances, an element of a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
controversy may be discerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6. That brings me to the political question doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its accepted signification is that where the
matter involved is left to a decision by the people acting in their sovereign
capacity or to the sole determination by either or both the legislative or
executive branches of the government, it is beyond judicial cognizance.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
Thus it was that in suits where the party proceeded against was either the
President or Congress, or any of its branches for that matter, the courts
refused to act.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a>
Unless such be the case, the action taken by any or both the political branches
whether in the form of a legislative act or an executive order could be tested
in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where private rights are
affected, the judiciary has the duty to look into its validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is this further implication of the
doctrine A showing that plenary power is granted either department of
government may not be an obstacle to judicial inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its improvident exercise or the abuse thereof
may give rise to a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a>
What is more, a constitutional grant of authority is not usually unrestricted.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
Limitations are provided for as to what may be done and how it is to be
accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily then, it
becomes the responsibility of the courts to ascertain whether the two
coordinate branches have adhered to the mandate of the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question thus posed is judicial rather
than political.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. Reference at this point to the epochal opinion in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> <i>vs</i>. Garcia
decision, where the validity of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus was sustained by this Court, is not amiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in both the 1935 and the present
Constitutions, the power to declare martial law is embraced in the same provision
with the grant of authority to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus, with the same limits to be observed in the exercise thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a>
It would follow, therefore, that a similar approach commends itself on the
question of whether or not the finding made by the President in Proclamation
No. 1081 as to the existence of "rebellion and armed action undertaken by
these lawless elements of the communist and other armed <span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span>
organized to overthrow the Republic of the Philippines by armed violence and
force [impressed with the] magnitude of an actual state of war against [the]
people and the Republic."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a> is open to judicial inquiry.
Reference to the opinion of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
would prove illuminating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Indeed,
the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute nor
unqualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority conferred by
the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive
Department, is limited and conditional.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as
an exception thereto. What is more, it postulates the former in the negative,
evidently to stress its importance, by providing that '(t)he privilege of the
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not be suspended....' It is only by way of
exception that it permits the suspension of the privilege 'in cases of
invasion, insurrection, or rebellion' -- or, under Art. VII of the
Constitution, 'imminent danger thereof' — 'when the public safety requires it,
in any of which events the same may be suspended wherever during such period
the necessity for such suspension shall exist.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Far from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege
of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined and restricted not only by the
prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but also as
regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These factors and the aforementioned setting
or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the
limits of said power, beyond which it does not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, like the limitations and restrictions
imposed by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence
thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by
courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless. Surely, the
framers of our Constitution could not have intended to engage in such a
wasteful exercise in futility."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a> Such a view was fortified by the
high estate accorded individual freedom as made clear in the succeeding
paragraph of his opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Much
less may the assumption be indulged in when we bear in mind that our political
system is essentially democratic and republican in character and that the
suspension of the privilege affects the most fundamental element of that
system, namely, individual freedom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, such freedom includes and connotes, as well as demands, the
right of every single member of our citizenry to freely discuss and dissent
from, as well as criticize and denounce, the views, the policies and the
practices of the government and the party in power that he deems unwise,
improper or inimical to the commonwealth, regardless of whether his own opinion
is objectively correct or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The untrammeled
enjoyment and exercise of such right — which; under certain conditions, may be
a civic duty of the highest order — is vital to the democratic system and
essential to its successful operation and wholesome growth and
development."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The writer wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was fully in agreement with the rest of
his brethren as to the lack of conclusiveness attached to the presidential
determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The doctrine announced in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Montenegro</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<i>vs</i>. Castaneda that such a question is political has thus been laid to
rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is about time too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It owed its existence to the compulsion
exerted by <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> <i>vs</i>. Baker, a 1905
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court was partly misled
by an undue reliance in the latter case on what it considered to be
authoritative pronouncements from such illustrious American jurists as
Marshall, Story, and Taney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to
misread what was said by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
most evident in the case of Chief Justice Marshall, whose epochal <span class="SpellE">Marbury</span> <i>vs</i>. Madison was cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why that was so is difficult to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it speaks to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was by virtue of this decision that the
function of judicial review owes its origin notwithstanding the absence of any
explicit provision in the American Constitution empowering the courts to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It is emphatically the province and duty of
the judicial department to say what the law is.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound
and interpret that rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If two laws
conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So
if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the
constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide
that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably
to the constitution, disregarding, the law; the court must determine which of
these conflicting rules governs the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is of the very essence of judicial duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, then; the courts are to regard the
constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of
legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case
to which they, both apply."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>8. To refer to <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> anew, this Court
sustained the presidential proclamation suspending the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus as there was no showing of arbitrariness in the exercise of a
prerogative belonging to the executive, the judiciary merely acting as a check
on the exercise of such authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> made clear in this portion
of his opinion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Article VII of the
Constitution vests in the Executive power to suspend the privilege of the writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i> under specified conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the principle of separation of
powers underlying our system of government, the Executive is supreme within his
own sphere. However, the separation of powers, under the Constitution, is not
absolute. What is more, it goes hand in hand with the system of checks and
balances, under which the Executive is supreme, as regards the suspension of
the privilege, but only if and when he acts within the sphere allotted to him
by the Basic Law, and the authority to determine whether or not he has so acted
is vested in the Judicial Department, which, in this respect, is, in turn,
constitutionally supreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
exercise of such authority, the function of the Court is merely to <i>check </i>not
to <i>supplant</i> — the Executive, or to ascertain merely whether he has gone
beyond the constitutional limits of his jurisdiction, <i>not to exercise the
power vested</i> in him or to determine the wisdom of his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the power of the Court to
determine the validity of the contested proclamation is far from being
identical to, or even comparable with, its power over ordinary civil or
criminal cases elevated thereto by ordinary appeal from inferior courts, in
which cases the appellate court has <i>all </i>of the powers of the court of
origin."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a>
The test then to determine whether the presidential action should be nullified
according to the Supreme Court is that of arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent such a showing, there is no
justification for annulling the presidential proclamation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On this point, the writer, in a separate opinion, had this to
say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"With such presidential
determination of the existence of the conditions required by the Constitution
to justify a suspension of the privilege of the writ no longer conclusive on
the other branches, this Court may thus legitimately inquire into its
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question before us, it
bears repeating, is whether or not Proclamation No. 889 as it now stands, not
as it was originally issued, is valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The starting point must be a recognition that the power to suspend the
privilege of the writ belongs to the Executive, subject to limitations. So the
Constitution provides, and it is to be respected. The range of permissible inquiry
to be conducted by this Tribunal is necessarily limited then to the
ascertainment of whether or not such a suspension, in the light of the credible
information furnished the President, was arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a test met with the approval of the
chief counsel for petitioners, Senator Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase Frankfurter, the question
before the judiciary is not the correctness but the reasonableness of the
action taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One who is not the
Executive but equally knowledgeable may entertain a different view, but the
decision rests with the occupant of the office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As would be immediately apparent even from a cursory perusal of the data
furnished the President, so impressively summarized in the opinion of the Chief
Justice, the imputation of arbitrariness would be difficult to sustain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the steps taken by him to limit the
area where the suspension operates as well as his instructions attested to a
firm resolve on his part to keep strictly within the bounds of his
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
decision reached by the Court that no finding of unconstitutionality is
warranted commends itself for approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The most that can be said is that there was a manifestation of
presidential power well-nigh touching the extreme borders of his conceded
competence, beyond which a forbidden domain lies. The requisite showing of
either improvidence or abuse has not been made."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>9. The <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> doctrine for me is
decisive on the various issues raised in this case, my discussion being
confined to petitioner Rodrigo, as well as others similarly situated, for under
my view that the petition in <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> should be
dismissed because charges had been filed, and the petition in <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> should be considered withdrawn, there need be no
further inquiry as to the merits of their respective contentions.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now, first as to the validity of the proclamation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem that it is beyond question in
the light of this particular transitory provision in the present
Constitution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"All proclamations,
orders, decrees, instructions, and acts promulgated, issued, or done by the
incumbent President shall be part of the law of the land, and shall remain
valid, legal, binding, and effective even after lifting of martial law or the
ratification of this Constitution, unless modified, revoked, or superseded by
subsequent proclamations, orders, decrees, instructions, or other acts of the
incumbent President, or unless expressly and explicitly modified or repealed by
the regular National Assembly."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a> Independently of such provision,
such presidential proclamation could not be characterized as arbitrary under
the standard set forth in the <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did act "on the basis of carefully
evaluated and verified information, [which] definitely established that lawless
elements who are moved by a common or similar ideological conviction, design
strategy and goal and enjoying the active moral and material support of a
foreign power and being guided and directed by intensely devoted, well-trained,
determined and ruthless groups of men and seeking refuge under the protection
of our constitutional liberties to promote and attain their ends, have entered
into a conspiracy and have in fact joined and banded their resources and forces
together for the prime purpose of, and in fact they have been and are actually
staging, undertaking and waging an armed insurrection and rebellion against the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines in order to forcibly seize
political and state power in the country, overthrow the duly constituted
government and supplant our existing political, social, economic and legal
order with an entirely new one whose form of government, whose system of laws,
whose conception of God and religion, whose notion of individual rights and
family relations, and whose political, social, economic legal and moral
precepts are based on the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist teachings and beliefs; . .

<p class="BODY">Subsequent events did confirm the validity of such
appraisal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even now, from the pleadings
of the Solicitor General, the assumption that the situation has not in certain
places radically changed for the better cannot be stigmatized as devoid of
factual foundation. As of the present then, even on the view that the courts
may declare that the crisis conditions have ended and public safety does not
require the continuance of martial law, there is not enough evidence to warrant
such a judicial declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
to deny that in an appropriate case with the proper parties, and, in the
language of Justice Laurel, with such issue being the very <span class="SpellE"><i>lis</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">mota</span></i>, they may be compelled to assume such an
awesome responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sense of
realism as well as sound juristic theory would place such delicate task on the
shoulders of this Tribunal, the only constitutional court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I would read <span class="SpellE">Rutter</span>
<i>vs</i>. Esteban.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a> There, while the Moratorium Act<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a>
was at first assumed to be valid, with this Court in such suit being persuaded
that its "continued operation and enforcement" under circumstances
that developed later, became "unreasonable and oppressive," and
should not be prolonged a minute longer, ... [it was] "declared null and
void and without effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a> It goes without saying that before
it should take such a step, extreme care should be taken lest, the maintenance
of public peace and order, the primary duty of the Executive, be attended with
extreme difficulty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise
essential that the evidence of public safety no longer requiring martial law be
of the clearest and most satisfactory character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be too strongly stressed that while
liberty is a prime objective and the judiciary is charged with the duty of
safeguarding it, on a matter of such gravity during periods of emergency, the
executive appraisal of the situation is deserving of the utmost credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to recall the stress laid by
Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>
that its function "is merely to <i>check</i> — not to <i>supplant</i>"
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allocation of authority
in the Constitution made by the people themselves to the three departments of
government must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
to be no intrusion by any one into the sphere that belongs to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely because of such fundamental
postulate in those cases, and there may be such, but perhaps rather rare, it
could amount to judicial abdication if no inquiry were deemed permissible and
the question considered political.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last point is, while the detention of petitioners could have
been validly ordered, as dictated by the very proclamation itself, if it
continued for an unreasonable length of time, then his release may be sought in
a habeas corpus proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is not devoid of plausibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even in times of stress, it cannot just be assumed that the indefinite
restraint of certain individuals as a preventive measure is unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be denied that where such a
state of affairs could be traced to the wishes of the President himself it
carries with it the presumption of validity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The test is again arbitrariness as defined in <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may happen that the continued confinement
may be at the instance merely of a military official, in which case there is
more leeway for judicial scrutiny.</p>

<blockquote>10. A word more on the withdrawal of a habeas corpus petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basic assumption that precisely the
great writ of liberty is available to a person subjected to restraint so that
he could challenge its validity, I find it difficult not to yield assent to a
plea by the applicant himself that he is no longer desirous' of pursuing such
remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a choice of whether or
not to go to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was free to act
either way. The fact that at first he did so, but that later he was of a
different mind, does not, in my opinion, alter the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter for me, is still one left to his
free and unfettered will. The conclusion then, for me at least, is that a court
must accede to his wishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could
likewise be based on his belief that the realities of the situation compel the
conclusion that relief could come from the Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That decision was his to make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if only because of humanitarian
considerations, considering the ill-effects of confinement on his state of
health, there is equally legal support for the view that his conditional
release as in the case of the other detainees would not be inappropriate.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If his motion for withdrawal contained phraseology that is
offensive to the dignity of the court, then perhaps the corresponding
disciplinary action may be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
that purpose, and for that purpose alone, the petition may be considered as
still within judicial cognizance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
true in certain cases that the issues raised may be so transcendental that
there is wisdom in continuing the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The withdrawal, even then, for me, is not fraught with pernicious
consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the matter were that
significant or important, the probability is that the question will soon be
ventilated in another petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is, to deal briefly with another point, the matter of the rather harsh and
bitter language in which the motion for withdrawal was couched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a matter of taste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it went beyond the bounds of the
permissible, the withdrawal should be granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This for me is the principle that should obtain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rather uncharitable view expressed
concerning the ability of certain members of the Court to act justly on the
matter should not give rise, in my opinion, to undue concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is one's belief, and one is entitled to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not follow that thereby the
person thus unjustifiably maligned should suffer any loss of self-esteem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is a truism to say that a man
on the bench accountable only to his conscience and, in the ultimate analysis,
to his Maker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is all the more
reason then not to be unduly bothered by the remarks in question. Moreover,
they emanated from a source suffering from the pangs of desperation born of his
continued detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could very well
be that the disappointment of expectations and frustration of hopes did lead to
such an intemperate outburst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is,
for me at least, relevance to this excerpt from an opinion by Justice
Frankfurter:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Since courts,
although representing the law, ... are also sitting in judgment, as it were, on
their own function in exercising their power to punish for contempt, it should
be used only in flagrant cases and with the utmost forbearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is always better to err on the side of
tolerance and even of disdainful indifference."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>11. There is novelty in the question raised by petitioner
Rodrigo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is that the only reason why
it matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fraught with
significance not only for him but also for quite a number of others in a like
predicament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They belong to a group
released from confinement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are no
longer detained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily that should
suffice to preclude resort to the remedy of habeas corpus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Offhand, it may be plausibly asserted that
the need no longer exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prison
wall, to paraphrase Chafee, is no longer there; it has fallen down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is there to penetrate? That is just the
point, petitioner Rodrigo complains. That is not really true or only true
partially. There are physical as well as intellectual restraints on his
freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His release is
conditional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are things he cannot
say, places he cannot go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not
liberty in a meaningful sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
great writ then has not lost its significance for him, as well as for others
similarly situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The way he developed
his argument calls to mind <span class="SpellE">Cardozo's</span> warning that in
a world of reality, a juridical concept may not always be pressed to the limit
of its logic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are countervailing
considerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he was
among those whose detention was ordered by the President is one of them. There
was then an executive determination on the highest level that the state of
affairs marked by rebellious activities did call for certain individuals being
confined as a preventive measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless
there is a showing of the arbitrariness of such a move, the judiciary has to
respect the actuation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
assumed that what was to be done with them thereafter must have been given some
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one extreme, their
preventive detention could be terminated and their full freedom restored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the other, it could be continued if
circumstances did so warrant. Here, there was a middle way chosen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Rodrigo as well as several others
were released subject to conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be dogmatically maintained that such a solution was an affront to
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only for the person locked
up, but perhaps even more so for his family, the end of the incarceration was
an eagerly awaited and highly welcome event.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is quite understandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
did justify petitioner's assertion that in so agreeing to the conditions
imposed, he was not acting of his own free will. Realistically, he had no
choice, or one minimal at most.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that he was a recipient of what at the
very least was a clear manifestation of the Philippine brand of martial law
being impressed with a mild character.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This being a habeas corpus petition, the appropriate question for
judicial inquiry is the validity of the limits set to the conditional release
of petitioner Rodrigo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guiding
principle, is supplied by this ringing affirmation of Justice Malcolm:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Any restraint which will preclude
freedom of action is sufficient."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a> The implication for me is that
there may be instances of the propriety of the invocation of the writ even
without actual incarceration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is heartening that the
Court so views it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, to my mind,
regrettable though that there appears to be full acceptance of the power of the
military to impose restrictions on petitioner Rodrigo's physical liberty. There
is need, it would seem to me, for a more discriminating appraisal, especially
where it could be shown that the order to that effect proceeds from a source
lower than the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The extremely
high respect justifiably accorded to the action taken by the highest official
of the land, who by himself is a separate and independent department, not to
mention the one constitutional official authorized to proclaim martial law, is
not indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should be, of
course, no casual or unreasoned disregard for what the military may deem to be
the appropriate measure under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This reflection, though, gives me pause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Rodrigo and others similarly situated
were released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That step would not have
been taken if circumstances did not justify it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It seems then reasonable to assume that full, rather than restricted,
freedom was warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter may be
put forth more categorically, but I refrain from doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is practical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To insist that it should be thus may curb
what appears to be the commendable tendency to put an end to the preventive
detention of those in actual confinement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As for restraints on intellectual liberty embraced in freedom of speech
and of press, of assembly, and of association, deference to controlling
authorities compels me to say that the writ of habeas corpus is not the proper
case for assailing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
mean that judicial inquiry is foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Far from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is intended
to be conveyed is that this remedy does not lend itself to that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so advocating this approach, I am not
unmindful that it might be looked upon as lack of awareness for the mischief
that may be caused by irresponsible elements, not to say the rebels
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words of <st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>,
whose view on martial law is the most sympathetic to the primacy of liberty,
furnish the antidote:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As long as
the emergency lasts then, they must upon pain of arrest and subsequent punishment
refrain from committing acts that will render more difficult the restoration of
a state of normalcy and the enforcement of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>12. Reliance, as is quite evident from the foregoing, is well-nigh
solely placed on Philippine authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the persuasive character of American Constitutional law doctrines
is not entirely a thing of the past, still, the novelty of the question before
us, compels in my view deference to the trend indicated by our past decisions,
read in the light not only of specific holdings but also of the broader
principles on which they are based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
if they do not precisely control, they do furnish a guide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there seems to be a dearth of
United States Supreme Court pronouncements on the subject of martial law, due
no doubt to absence in the American Constitution of any provision concerning
it.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is understandable why no reference was made to such subject in
the earliest classic on American constitutional law written by Justice Story.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a>
When the landmark 1866 Milligan case<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">41</span></span></a> made its appearance, and much more
so after <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">42</span></span></a>
followed in 1932 and <st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">43</span></span></a>
in 1946, a discussion thereof became unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is evident from subsequent commentaries
and case books.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">44</span></span></a>
Cooley though, in his equally famous work that was first published in 1868
contented himself with footnote references to Milligan.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">45</span></span></a>
Watson viewed it in connection with the suspension of the privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">46</span></span></a> In the nineteen twenties, there
was a fuller treatment of the question of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Burdick anticipated <st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>
with this appraisal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"So-called
martial law, except in occupied territory of an enemy; is merely the calling in
of the aid of military forces by the executive, who is charged with the
enforcement of the law, with or without special authorization by the
legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such declaration of martial
law does not suspend the civil law, though it may interfere with the exercise
of one's ordinary rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to
call out the military forces to maintain order and enforce the law is simply
part of the police power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only
justified when it reasonably appears necessary, and only justifies such acts as
reasonably appear necessary to meet the exigency, including the arrest, or in
extreme cases the killing of those who create the disorder or oppose the
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the exigency is over
the members of the military forces are criminally and civilly liable for acts
done beyond the scope of reasonable necessity. When honestly and reasonably
coping with a situation of insurrection or riot a member of the military forces
cannot be made liable for his acts, and persons reasonably arrested under such
circumstances will not, during the insurrection or riot, be free by writ of
habeas corpus."<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">47</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>, as already
noted, was partial to the claims of liberty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is quite evident in this excerpt in his opus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is, then, strictly speaking, no
such thing in American law as a declaration of martial law whereby military law
is substituted for civil law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So-called
declarations of martial law are, indeed, often made, but their legal effect
goes no further than to warn citizens that the military powers have been called
upon by the executive to assist him in the maintenance of law and order, and
that, while the emergency lasts, they must, upon pain of arrest and punishment,
not commit any acts which will in any way render more difficult the restoration
of order and the enforcement of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some of the authorities stating substantially this doctrine are quoted
in the footnote below."<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">48</span></span></a> Willis spoke similarly:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Martial law proper, that is, military
law in case of insurrection, riots, and invasions, is not a substitute for the
civil law, but is rather an aid to the execution of civil law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declarations of martial law go no further
than to warn citizens that the executive has called upon the military power to
assist him in the maintenance of law and order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While martial law is in force, no new powers are given to the executive
and no civil rights of the individual, other than the writ of habeas corpus,
are suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relations between the
citizen and his state are unchanged."<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">49</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is readily evident that even when Milligan supplied the only
authoritative doctrine, Burdick and <st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>
did not ignore the primacy of civil liberties. Willis wrote after <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would indeed be surprising if his opinion
were otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Duncan, such an
approach becomes even more, strongly fortified, Schwartz, whose treatise is the
latest to be published, has this summary of what he considers the present,
state of American law:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The<i>
Milligan and Duncan </i>cases show plainly that martial law is the public law
of necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessity alone, calls it
forth; necessity justifies its exercise; and necessity measures the extent and
degree to which it may be employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is, the high Court has affirmed, an unbending rule of law that the exercise of
military power, where the rights of the citizen are concerned, may never be
pushed beyond what the exigency requires.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If martial rule survives the necessity on which alone it rests, for even
a single minute, it becomes a mere exercise of lawless<i> violence</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">50</span></span></a>
Further:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<i>Sterling vs. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></i> is of basic importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before it, a number of decisions, including
one by the highest Court, went on the theory that the executive had a free hand
in taking martial-law measures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
them, it had been widely supposed that a martial-law proclamation was so far
conclusive that any action taken under it was immune from judicial
scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Sterling vs. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></i> definitely discredits these earlier
decisions and the doctrine of conclusiveness derived from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under <i>Sterling vs. <span class="SpellE">Constantin</span></i>,
where martial law measures impinge upon personal or property rights — normally
beyond the scope of military power, whose intervention is lawful only because
an abnormal situation has made it necessary — the executive's <i>ipse <span class="SpellE">dixit</span></i> is not of itself conclusive of the
necessity."<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">51</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not to be lost sight of that the basis for the declaration
of martial law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is not mere necessity but an explicit constitutional provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Milligan, which furnished
the foundation for <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city><a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">52</span></span></a>

had its roots in the English common law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is pertinence therefore in ascertaining its significance under
that system. According to the noted English author, Dicey:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“ ‘Martial law,’ in the proper sense of that
term, in which it means the suspension of ordinary law and the temporary
government of a country or parts of it by military tribunals, is unknown to the
law of England.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have nothing
equivalent to what is called in <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
the 'Declaration of the State of <st1:state><st1:place>Siege</st1:place></st1:state>,'
under which the authority ordinarily vested in the civil power for the
maintenance of order and police passes entirely to the army (<span class="SpellE">autorite</span> <span class="SpellE">militaire</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an unmistakable proof of the
permanent supremacy of the law under our constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">54</span></span></a>
There was this qualification:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Martial law is sometimes employed as a name for the common law
right of the Crown and its servants to repel force by force in the case of
invasion, insurrection, riot, or generally of any violent resistance to the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right, or power, is essential
to the very existence of orderly government, and is most assuredly recognized
in the most ample manner by the law of <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a power which has in itself no special
connection with the existence of an armed force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Crown has the right to put down breaches
of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every subject, whether a
civilian or a soldier, whether what is called a 'servant of the government,'
such for example as a policeman, or a person in no way connected with the
administration, not only has the right, but is, as a matter of legal duty,
bound to assist in putting down breaches of the peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt policemen or soldiers are the
persons, who, as being specially employed in the maintenance of order, are most
generally called upon to suppress a riot, but it is clear that all loyal
subjects are bound to take their part in the suppression of riots."<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">55</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The picture would be incomplete, of course, if no reference were
made to <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his work on Constitutional Dictatorship, where he discussed crisis
governments in the <st1:place><st1:placename>French</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Great Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
he spoke of martial rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For him, it
"is an emergency device designed for use in the crises of invasion or
rebellion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be most precisely
defined as an extension of military government to the civilian population, the
substitution of the will of a military commander for the will of the people's
elected government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event of an
actual or imminent invasion by a hostile power, a constitutional government may
declare martial rule in the menaced area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The result is the transfer of all effective powers of government from
the civil authorities to the military, or often merely the assumption of such
powers by the latter when the regular government has ceased to function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event of a rebellion its initiation
amounts to a governmental declaration of war on those citizens in insurrection
against the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case it
means military dictatorship — government by the army, courts-martial,
suspension of civil liberties, and the whole range of dictatorial action of an
executive nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the modern
democracies the military exercises such dictatorship while remaining
subordinate and responsible to the executive head of the civil government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martial rule has a variety of forms and
pseudonyms, the most important of which are <i>martial law</i>, as it is known
in the common law countries of the <st1:place>British Empire</st1:place> and
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and the <i>state of <span class="SpellE">seige</span></i>, as it is known in the
civil law countries of continental <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and <st1:place>Latin
 America</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The state of siege
and martial law are two edges to the same sword, and in action they can hardly
be distinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The institution of
martial rule is a recognition that there are times in the lives of all
communities when crisis has so completely disrupted the normal workings of
government that the military is the only power remaining that can restore
public order and secure the execution of the laws."<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">56</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Happily for the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the declaration of martial law lends itself to the interpretation that the
Burdick, <st1:city><st1:place>Willoughby</st1:place></st1:city>, Willis,
Schwartz formulations paying due regard to the primacy of liberty possess
relevance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said that the
martial rule concept of <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span>, latitudinarian in
scope, has been adopted, even on the assumption that it can be reconciled with
our Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is undeniable is
that President Marcos has repeatedly maintained that Proclamation No. 1081 was
precisely based on the Constitution and that the validity of acts taken <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> could be passed upon by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me, that is quite reassuring, persuaded
as I am likewise that the view of <span class="SpellE">Rossiter</span> is opposed
to the fundamental concept of our polity, which puts a premium on freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No undue concern need then be felt as to the
continuing reliance on Moyer <i>vs</i>. Peabody,<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">57</span></span></a> where Justice Holmes speaking for
the Court, stated that the test of the validity of executive arrest is that
they be made "in good faith and in the honest belief that they are 'needed
in order to head the insurrection off . . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">58</span></span></a>
He did state likewise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When it
comes to a decision by the head of the state upon a matter involving its life,
the ordinary rights of individuals must yield to what he deems the necessities
of the moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public danger warrants

</span>More specifically, it was from his pen, in <span class="SpellE">Chastleton</span>
Corporation <i>vs</i>. Sinclair,<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">60</span></span></a> where the doctrine that the
judiciary may inquire into whether the emergency was at an end, was given
expression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We repeat what was stated in Block <i>vs</i>.
Hirsh,......, as to the respect due to a declaration of this kind by the
legislature so far as it relates to present facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, even as to them, a court is not at
liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law
depends upon the truth of what is declared. . . . And still more obviously, so
far as this declaration looks to the future, is can be no more than prophecy,
and is liable to be controlled by events.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A law depending upon the existence of an emergency or other certain
state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if the emergency ceases or the
facts change, even though valid when passed."<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">61</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>13. It may safely be concluded therefore that the role of American
courts concerning the legality of acts taken during a period of martial law is
far from minimal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why it must be so was
explained by Dean <span class="SpellE">Rostow</span> in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Unless the courts require a showing, in
cases like these, of an intelligible relationship between means and ends,
society has lost its basic protection against the abuse of military power. The
general's good intention must be irrelevant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There should be evidence in court that his military judgment had a
suitable basis in fact. As Colonel <span class="SpellE">Fairman</span>, a strong
proponent of widened military discretion, points out:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'When the executive fail or is unable to
satisfy the court of the evident necessity for the extraordinary measures it
has taken, it can hardly expect the court to assume it on faith.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">62</span></span></a>
This is the way <span class="SpellE">Lasswell</span> would summarize the
matter:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the whole, we can
conclude that the courts of this country have a body of ancient principles and
recent precedents that can be used to keep at a minimum unnecessary encroachments
upon private rights by the executive, civil or military.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vigor and sensitiveness with which the
due process clause has been affirmed in the last two decades is, in particular,
an important development."<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">63</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>14. It may be that the approach followed may for some be indicative
of lack of full awareness of today's stern realities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my submission that to so view the
transcendental issues before us is to adhere as closely as possible to the
ideal envisioned in Ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> Milligan:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The Constitution is a law for rulers
and for people equally in war and in peace and covers with the shield of its
protection all classes of men at all times and under all circumstances."<a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">64</span></span></a>
It is ever timely to reiterate that at the core of constitutionalism is a
robust concern for individual rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not to deny that the judicial process does not take place in a
social void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questions that call for
decision are to be examined in the total social context with full appreciation
of the environmental facts, whether viewed in its temporal or other relevant
aspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have to reconcile
time-tested principles to contemporary problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legal norms cannot always stand up against
the pressure of events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The great
unquestioned verities may thus prove to be less than adequate. So much is
conceded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, even with the
additional difficulty that the Court today is compelled to enter terrain with
boundaries not so clearly defined, carrying with it the risk of exceeding the
normal limits of judicial imprecision, I find myself unable to resist the
compulsion of constitutional history and traditional doctrines. The facts and
issues of the petitions before us and the mandates of the fundamental law, as I
view them in the light of accepted concepts, blunt the edge of what otherwise
could be considerations of decisive impact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I find myself troubled by the thought that, were it otherwise, it would
amount to freezing the flux of the turbulent present with its grave and
critical problems in the icy permanence of juristic doctrines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of now, such an uncomfortable thought
intrudes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this brief concurring
and dissenting opinion.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Prefatory statement</i>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This separate opinion was prepared and scheduled to be promulgated with
the judgment of the Court (penned by the Chief Justice) on <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such promulgation was however overtaken by
the welcome news of the release from detention on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date> of petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> upon the order of President Ferdinand E. Marcos; and
the Court then resolved to defer promulgation until the following week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Part I of this opinion dealing with
the <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> petition should be read in such time
context.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two other parts thereof of dealing with the <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and Rodrigo cases are to be read as of the actual
date of promulgation, since they reiterate a main theme of the opinion that the
Court should adhere to file well-grounded principle of not ruling on
constitutional issues except when necessary in an appropriate case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the writer's view, the gratifying
development in the <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> case which rendered his
petition moot by virtue of his release once more demonstrates the validity of
this principle.</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>On the <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> petition</i>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I vote for the granting of petitioner Jose W. <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span>
motion of December 29, 1973 to withdraw the petition for habeas corpus filed on
September 23, 1972 on his behalf and the supplemental petition and motions for
immediate release and for oral argument of June 29, 1973 and August 14, 1973
filed in support thereof, as prayed for.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. The present action is one of habeas corpus and the detainee's
own withdrawal of his petition is decisive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the detainee himself withdraws his petition and no longer wishes this
Court to pass upon the legality of his detention and cites the other pending
habeas corpus cases which have not been withdrawn and wherein Court can rule on
the constitutional issues if so minded,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
such withdrawal of a habeas corpus petition should be granted practically as a
matter of absolute right (whatever be the motivations <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>)
in the same manner that the withdrawal motions of the petitioners in the other
cases were previously granted by the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since there were seven (7) members of the Court who voted for
granting the withdrawal motion as against five (5) members who voted for
denying the same and rendering a decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> I
submit that this majority of seven (7) out of the Court's membership of twelve
(12) is a sufficient majority for granting the withdrawal prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple majority of seven is legally
sufficient for the granting of a <i>withdrawal </i>of a petition, since it does
not involve the rendition of a decision on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only where a <i>decision</i> is to be
rendered on the merits by the Court <i>en banc</i> that the 1973 Constitution
requires the concurrence of at least eight (8) members.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore dissent from the majority's adhering to the
five-member minority view that the majority of members seven is not legally
sufficient for granting withdrawal and that a decision on the merits be
rendered notwithstanding the withdrawal of the petition.</p>

<blockquote>2. The granting of the withdrawal of the petition is but in
consonance with the fundamental principle on the exercise of judicial power
which, in the words of the Solicitor-General, "as Justice Laurel
emphasized, is justifiable only as a necessity for the resolution of an actual
case and controversy and therefore should be confined to the very <span class="SpellE"><i>lis</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">mota</span></i>
presented."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such withdrawal is furthermore in accord with the respondents'
stand from the beginning urging the Court not to take cognizance (for want of
jurisdiction or as a matter of judicial restraint citing Brandeis' injunction
that "The most important thing we decide is what not to decide'<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>)
or that "at the very least, this Court should postpone consideration of
this case until the present emergency is over."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Many of the other petitioners in the habeas corpus cases at bar
were granted leave to withdraw their petitions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Diokno's</span> withdrawal motion should
likewise be granted in line with the well-established doctrine that the Court
will not rule on constitutional issues except when necessary in an appropriate
case.</p>

<blockquote>3. But the Solicitor-General now objects to the withdrawal on the
ground of public interest and that "this Tribunal . . . has been used as
the open forum for underground propaganda by those who have political axes to
grind" with the circulation of the withdrawal motion and that this Court
would be "putting the seal of approval" and in effect admit the
"unfair, untrue and contemptuous" statements made in the withdrawal
motion should this Court grant the withdrawal.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> I
see no point in the position taken by the Solicitor-General of urging the Court
to deny the withdrawal motion only to render a decision that would after all
dismiss the petition and sustain respondents' defense of <i>political question</i>
and have the Court declare itself <i>without jurisdiction</i> to adjudicate the
constitutional issues presented<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and asking the Court to embrace the "pragmatic method" of William
James which "rejects ... the a priori assumption that there are immutable
principles of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It tests a
proposition by its practical consequences."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The objections are untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public interest objection is met by the fact that there are
still pending other cases (principally the prohibition case of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. in another
case, L-37364 questioning the filing of grave charges under the Anti-Subversion
Act, etc. against him with a military commission<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and which is not yet submitted for decision) where the same constitutional
issues may be resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other objections are tenuous:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor-General refutes his own objections in his closing
statement in his comment that "for their part, respondents are confident
that in the end they would be upheld in their defense, as indeed petitioner and
counsel have practically <i>confessed judgment </i>in this case."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The propaganda objection is not a valid ground for denying the
withdrawal of the petition and should not be held against petitioner who had
nothing whatsoever to do with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The objection that granting the withdrawal motion would amount to
an admission of the "unfair, untrue and contemptuous statements" made
therein is untenable since it is patent that granting the withdrawal motion per
se (regardless of petitioner's reasons) does not amount to an admission of the
truth or validity of such reasons and as conceded by the Solicitor-General,
neither will denying the withdrawal motion per se disprove the reasons.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The untruth, unfairness or contumacy of such reasons may best be dealt with,
clarified or expounded by the Court and its members in the Court's resolution
granting withdrawal or in the separate opinions of the individual justices (as
has actually been done and which the writer will now proceed to do).</p>

<blockquote>4. Petitioner's first reason for withdrawal is subjective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After mentioning various factors,
particularly, the fact that five of the six justices (including the writer) who
held in the Ratification cases<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
that the 1973 Constitution had not been validly ratified had taken on October
29, 1973 an oath to support and defend the new Constitution, he expresses his
feeling that "(I) cannot reasonably expect either right or reason law or
justice, to prevail in my case," that "the unusual length of the
struggle also indicates that its conscience is losing the battle" and that
"since I do not wish to be a party to an adverse decision, I must renounce
every possibility of favorable judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
A party's subjective evaluation of the Court's action is actually of no moment,
for its has always been recognized that this Court, possessed of neither the
sword nor the purse, must ultimately and objectively rest its authority on
sustained public confidence in the truth, justice, integrity and moral force of
its judgments.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's second reason for withdrawal reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“(S)<span class="SpellE">econd</span>, in view
of the new oath that its members have taken, the present Supreme Court is a new
Court functioning under a new 'Constitution,' different from the Court and the
Constitution under which I applied for my release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was willing to be judged by the old Court
under the old Constitution, but not by the new Court under the new
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is in error in his assumption that this Court is a
"new Court functioning under a new Constitution different from the Court
and the Constitution under which [he] applied for [his] release." The same
Supreme Court has continued save that it now operates under Article X of the
1973 Constitution which <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> increased
its component membership from eleven to fifteen and transferred to it
administrative supervision over all courts and personnel thereof with the power
of discipline and dismissal over judges of inferior courts in the same manner
that the same Republic of the Philippines of which the Supreme Court is but a
part has continued in existence but now operates under the 1973 Constitution.'<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the period of ninety days that the Ratification cases were
pending before the Court until its dismissal of the cases per its resolution of
March 31, 1973 became final on April 17, 1973, the Executive Department was
operating under the 1973 Constitution in accordance with President Ferdinand E.
Marcos' Proclamation No. 1102 on January 17, 1973 announcing the ratification
and coming into effect of the 1973 Constitution while this Court as the only
other governmental department continued to operate under the 1935 Constitution
pending its final resolution on the said cases challenging the validity of
Proclamation No. 1102 and enforcement of the new Constitution. (As per the
Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1973</st1:date>,
it declined to take over from the Department of Justice the administrative
supervision over all inferior courts expressing its sense that "it is best
that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained until the case aforementioned (<span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> <i>vs</i>. Exec. Secretary) shall have been
finally resolved . . .")</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a situation could not long endure wherein the only two great
departments of government, the Executive and the Judicial,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a>
for a period of three months were operating under two different Constitutions
(presidential and parliamentary).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
this Court's resolution of dismissal of the Ratification cases by a majority of
six to four Justices became final and was entered on April 18, 1973 "with
the result that there (were) not enough votes to declare that the new
Constitution is not in force,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a> the Court and particularly the
remaining three dissenting Justices (notwithstanding their vote with three
others that the new Constitution had not been validly ratified<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
had to abide under the Rule of Law by the decision of the majority dismissing
the cases brought to enjoin the enforcement by the Executive of the new
Constitution and had to operate under it as the fundamental charter of the
government, unless they were to turn from legitimate dissent to internecine
dissidence for which they have neither the inclination nor the capability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court as the head of the Judicial Department thenceforth
assumed the power of administrative supervision over all courts and all other
functions and liabilities imposed on it under the new Constitution.
Accordingly, this Court and all other existing inferior courts continue to
discharge their judicial function and to hear and determine all pending cases
filed or submitted under the old (1935) Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a>
as well as new cases under the new (1973) Constitution with the full support of
the members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (none of whom has made
petitioner's claim that this is a "new Court" different from the
"old Court").</p>

<p class="BODY">A major liability imposed upon all members of the Court and all
other officials and employees was that under Article XVII, section 9 of the
Transitory Provisions<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a> which was destructive of their
tenure and called upon them "to vacate their respective offices upon the
appointment and qualification of their successors." Their taking the oath
on October 29, 1973 "to preserve and defend the new Constitution" by
virtue of their "having been continued in office"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
on the occasion of the oath-taking of three new members of the Court<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a>
pursuant to Article XV, section 4<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span> was meant to assure their
"continuity of tenure" by way of the President having exercised the
power of replacement under the cited provision and in effect replaced them with
themselves as members of the Court with the same order of seniority.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>5. The withdrawal in effect gives cause for judicial abstention and
further opportunity (pending submittal for decision of the <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
prohibition case in L-37364) to ponder and deliberate upon the host of grave
and fundamental constitutional questions involved which have thereby been
rendered unnecessary to resolve here and now.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the benchmark case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span><i>
vs. Garcia</i><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a>
when the Court declared that the President did not act arbitrarily in issuing
in August, 1971 Proclamation No. 889, as amended, suspending the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus for persons detained for the crimes of insurrection
or rebellion and other overt acts committed by them in furtherance thereof, the
Court held through then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> that
"our next step would have been the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, or a commissioner designated by
it, would have received evidence on whether — as stated in respondents' 'Answer
and Return' — said petitioners had been apprehended and detained 'on reasonable
belief' that they had participated in the crime of insurrection or rebellion.' "</p>

<p class="BODY">(However, since in the interval of two months during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, criminal complaints had been filed in
court against the petitioners-detainees (<span class="SpellE">Luzvimindo</span>
David, Gary <span class="SpellE">Olivar</span>, et al.). the Court found that
"it is best to let said preliminary examination and/or investigation be
completed, so that petitioners' release could be ordered by the court of first
instance, should it find that there is no probable cause against them, or a
warrant for their arrest could be issued should a probable cause be established
against them."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a> The Court accordingly ordered the
trial court "to act with utmost dispatch" in conducting the
preliminary investigation for violation of the Anti-Subversion Act and "to
issue the corresponding warrants of arrest, if probable cause is found to exist
against them, or otherwise, to order their release.")</p>

<p class="BODY">Can such a procedure for reception of evidence on the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> allegations concerning the detention as
indicated in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span> be likewise applied to
petitioner's case considering his prolonged detention for almost two years now
without charges?<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a>
It should also be considered that it is conceded that even though the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus has been suspended, it is suspended only as to
certain specific crimes and the "answer and return" of the
respondents who hold the petitioner under detention is not conclusive upon the
courts which may receive evidence and determine as held in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span>
(and as also provided in the Anti-Subversion Act [Republic Act 1700]) whether a
petitioner has been <i>in fact</i> apprehended and detained arbitrarily or
"on reasonable belief" that he has "participated in the crime of
insurrection or rebellion" or other related offenses as may be enumerated
in the proclamation suspending the privilege of the writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pertinent to this question is the Court's adoption in <span class="SpellE"><i>Lansang</i></span> of the doctrine of <i>Sterling vs.
Constantin</i><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></i></span></a>
enunciated through U.S. Chief Justice Hughes that even when the state has been
placed under martial law "... (<i>W)</i>hen there is a<i> substantial showing
that the exertion of state power has overridden private rights </i>secured by
that Constitution, the subject is<i> necessarily one for judicial inquiry</i>
in an appropriate proceeding directed against the individuals charged with the
transgression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To such a case the
Federal judicial power extends (Art. 3. sec. 2) and, so extending, <i>the court
has all the authority appropriate to its exercise</i>. . .."</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally pertinent is the Court's statement therein announcing the
members' unanimous conviction that it has the authority to inquire into the
existence of said factual bases [stated in the proclamation suspending the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or placing the country under martial law
as the case may be, since the requirements for the exercise of these powers are
the same and are provided in the very same clause] in order to determine the
constitutional sufficiency thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a> The Court stressed therein that
"indeed, the grant of power to suspend the privilege is neither absolute
nor unqualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority conferred
upon by the Constitution, both under the Bill of Rights and under the Executive
Department, is limited and conditional.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The precept in the Bill of Rights establishes a general rule, as well as
an exception thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it
postulates the former in the <i>negative</i> evidently to stress its
importance, by providing that '(t)he privilege of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
shall <i>not</i> be suspended ...' It is only by way of exception that it
permits the suspension of the privilege 'in cases of invasion, insurrection, or
rebellion' — or under Art. VII of the Constitution imminent danger thereof —
'when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be
suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall
exist.' Far from being full and plenary, the authority to suspend the privilege
of the writ is thus circumscribed, confined and restricted, not only by the
prescribed setting or the conditions essential to its existence, but, also, as
regards the time when and the place where it may be exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These factors and the aforementioned setting
or conditions mark, establish and define the extent, the confines and the
limits of said power, beyond which it does not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And like the limitations and restrictions
imposed, by the Fundamental Law upon the legislative department, adherence
thereto and compliance therewith may, within proper bounds, be inquired into by
the courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the
explicit constitutional provisions thereon would be meaningless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the framers of our Constitution could
not have intended to engage in such a wasteful exercise in futility."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While a state of martial law may bar such judicial inquiries
under the writ of habeas corpus in the actual theater of war, would the
proscription apply when martial law is maintained as an instrument of social
reform and the civil courts (as well as military commissions) are open and
freely functioning?</p>

<p class="BODY">What is the extent and scope of the validating provision of
Article XVII, section 3(2) of the Transitory Provisions of the 1973
Constitution?<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a></p>

process and to "speedy, impartial and public trial"<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a>
may be invoked under the present state of martial law?</p>

<p class="BODY">Is the exercise of martial law powers for the
institutionalization of reforms incompatible with recognizing the fundamental
liberties granted in the Bill of Rights?</p>

<p class="BODY">The President is well aware of the layman's view of the
"central problem of constitutionalism in our contemporary society . . .
whether or not the Constitution remains an efficient instrument for the
moderation of conflict within society.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are two aspects of this problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One is the regulation of freedom in order to prevent anarchy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other is the limitation of power in order
to prevent tyranny."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, he has declared that "The New Society looks to
individual rights as a matter of paramount concern, removed from the
vicissitudes of political controversy and beyond the reach of majorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are pledged to uphold the Bill of Rights
and as the exigencies may so allow, we are determined that each provision shall
be executed to the fullest,"<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a> and has acknowledged that
"martial law necessarily creates a command society [and] is a temporary
constitutional expedient of safeguarding the republic . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He has thus described the proclamation of martial law and
"the setting up of a corresponding crisis government" as
"constitutional authoritarianism," which is a recognition that while
his government is authoritarian it is essentially constitutional and recognizes
the supremacy of the new Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">He has further declared that "martial law should have
legally terminated on January 17, 1973 when the new Constitution was
ratified", but that "the popular clamor manifested in the referendum
(was) that the National Assembly be temporarily suspended" and the
reaction in the July, 1973 referendum "was violently against stopping the
use of martial law powers," adding that "I intend to submit this
matter at least once a year to the people, and when they say we should shift to
the normal functions of government, then we will do so."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The realization of the prospects for restoration of normalcy and
full implementation of each and every provision of the Bill of Rights as
pledged by the President would then hopefully come sooner rather than later and
provides an additional weighty reason for the exercise of judicial abstention
under the environmental circumstances and for the granting of the withdrawal
motion.</p>

<blockquote>II. <i>In the <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> case: </i><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I maintain my original vote as first
unanimously agreed by the Court for dismissal of the habeas corpus petition of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Jr. on the
ground that grave, charges against him for violation of the Anti-Subversion Act
(Republic Act 1700], etc. were filed in August 1973 and hence the present
petition has been superseded by the prohibition case then filed by him
questioning the filing of the charges against him with a military commission
rather than with the civil courts (which case is not yet submitted for
decision).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The said prohibition case involves the same constitutional issues
raised in the <span class="SpellE">Diokno</span> case and more, concerning the
constitutionality of having him tried by a military commission for offenses
allegedly committed by him long before the declaration of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident from the special and
affirmative defenses raised in respondents' answer therein filed just last <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1974</st1:date> by the Solicitor
General which reiterate the same defenses in his answer to the petition at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the same constitutional
issues may well be resolved if necessary in the decision yet to be rendered by
the Court in said prohibition case.</p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore dissent from the subsequent vote of the majority to
instead pass upon and resolve in advance the said constitutional issues
unnecessarily in the present case.</p>

<blockquote>III. <i>In the Rodrigo case</i>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I submit that the habeas corpus petition of Francisco "Soc"
Rodrigo as well as the petitions of those others similarly released should be
dismissed for having been rendered moot and academic by virtue of their release
from physical confinement and detention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That their release has been made subject to certain conditions (e.g. not
being allowed to leave the Greater Manila area without specific authorization
of the military authorities) does not mean that their action would survive,
since "(T)he restraint of liberty which would justify the issuance of the
writ must be more than a mere moral restraint; it must be actual or
physical."40 They may have some other judicial recourse for the removal of
such restraints but their action for habeas corpus cannot survive since they
are no longer deprived of their physical liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons and those already expounded
hereinabove, I dissent from the majority vote to pass upon and resolve in
advance the constitutional issues unnecessarily in the present case.</blockquote>

authority -- possessed of neither the purse nor the sword — ultimately rests on
sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be
nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in <span class="SpellE">appearnace</span> from political entanglements and by abstention

likely to be misinterpreted either as a vindictive action taken against the

expressed by the Petitioner — that this Court cannot do justice in this

would be to render judgment for the petitioner, although then others will
likely think that the Court is reacting to the charge. 'It is this harmful
