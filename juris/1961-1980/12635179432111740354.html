				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from a decision of
the Court of Tax Appeals reversing that of said official, in connection with
the liability of the Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc.,
for deficiency carrier's percentage tax, plus surcharge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc. -
hereinafter referred to as the taxpayer - is a foreign corporation duly
licensed to do business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, with head office in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Amsterdam</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Holland</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
taxpayer is engaged in the operation of ocean-going vessels, plying between the
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and other countries, transporting passengers
and cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, likewise, an agent and
representative of the Holland East Asia Lines, a Dutch shipping company, from
which the taxpayer receives compensation in the form of commissions for
services rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed
that from February to May, 1962, inclusive, vessels of the taxpayer and/or the
Holland East Asia Lines called at Philippine ports to load cargo, with freight,
payable at destination, valued at US $37,501.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sum had been collected by and paid to
the taxpayer's head office in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Holland</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, and was not actually turned over or
forwarded, as such freight fees, to the taxpayer in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only remittances received by the latter from its aforementioned head office
were those made, through its agent bank, for the operational expenses of the
branch office in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Prior to January, 1962,
its dollar earnings derived from freight revenues were converted into the
Philippine peso equivalent thereof, under the prevailing free market rate, for
purposes of the common carrier's tax prescribed in Section 192 of the National
Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
taxpayer discontinued this practice and, since February, 1962, it reported said
revenues, in its monthly returns for carrier's tax, based on the parity rate of
</span><span style="">P2 to </span><span style="">$1, end paid P1,500.00 as such carrier's
tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon examination of the records of
the taxpayer, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, hereinafter referred to as
the petitioner, held that, applying the free market conversion rate, the
taxpayer's gross receipts from February to, May, </span>1962, <span style="">aggregated P163,776.38, and, based thereon,
demanded payment of P2,219.35 as deficiency common carrier's tax, plus
surcharge and penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having found,
soon later, that the sum of P29,920.50 had twice been included in the
computation of said receipts, petitioner subsequently agreed with the taxpayer
that its gross receipts for the period in question, reckoned on the free market
conversion rate, amounted to P133,855.88, based on which petitioner demanded,
in a letter received by the taxpayer on January 18, 1963, payment of the total
sum of P1,471.39, </span>consisting <span style="">of
P1,177.12, as deficiency carrier's tax, plus a 25% surcharge, computed as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, likewise, demanded payment of P200.00 as compromise
penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The taxpayer protested against this deficiency assessment, upon
the ground that the conversion rate should be the parity rate of P2 to a US
dollar, not the current market rate, it being conceded that the freight fees in
question had not been physically remitted, as such, to the tax­payer in the
Philippines, but were actually collected by its head office abroad, which had
remitted no funds to the former, except those needed for its operating
expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last remittance <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> amounted to $20,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner having overruled the protest, the
taxpayer appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, which, relying mainly upon
Commissione<span style="">r </span><span style="">of Internal Revenue v. United States Lines,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a><span style=""> reversed
petitioner's decision, without costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this appeal by the petitioner, which we find to be well taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, "due to the
pressure on the international reserve of the country and the threat to economic
stability," as well as "the state of exchange crisis," the
Monetary Board availed of the emergency powers granted by Section 74 of
Republic Act No. 265, otherwise known as the Central Bank Act, and issued, on
December 9, 1949, Circular No. 20 restricting "sales of exchange by the
Central Bank," subjecting "all transactions in gold and foreign
exchange to licensing" by the same, and requiring the surrender thereto of
100% of all foreign exchange receipts at the official parity rate of P2 to a US

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this provision, the aforementioned freight fees
earned by the taxpayer are the product of "foreign exchange"
transactions, with<span style="">in the purview of
Central Bank Circular No. 20, because, having been collected by the taxpayer's
main office in Amsterdam, said fees are deemed to have been paid to the
taxpayer in the Philippines, on behalf of which the former had acted; because
they were due for services rendered in the Philippines, without which said main
office would have had no right to collect or receive said fees; because the
same represented the compensation for services performed by a resident of the
Philippines - the taxpayer's branch office therein; because they represented
"collections of residents made abroad," to which subdivision (h) of
said section 2 refers; and because they fall under the category of "(a)<span class="SpellE">ny</span> other transactions involving international financial
implications," covered by subdivision (m) of the same section.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that on July 16, 1959, the policy incorporated
in Circular No. 20 and implemented in subsequent circulars, was relaxed with
the enactment of Republic Act No. 2609, which directed the monetary authorities
to take steps for the adoption of a four-year program of gradual decontrol, <span style="">during which the Monetary Board, </span>with <span style="">the approval of the President, could and did
fix the conversion rate of the Philippine peso </span>to <span style="">the US dollar at a ratio <u>other</u> than
that prescribed </span>in Section 48 of Republic Act 265.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the period involved in the case at
bar, the free market conversion rate ranged from P3.47 to P3.65 to a US dollar,
at which rates the freight fees in question were computed in the contested
assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as said fees were
revenues derived from "foreign exchange" transactions, it follows
necessarily that the petitioner was fully justified in computing the taxpayer's
receipts at said free market rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory <span style="">of </span>the
taxpayer to the effect that, not having been <span style="">physically remitted </span>to <span style="">the
Philippines, the fees in question do </span>no<span style="">t </span>partake of the nature of revenues derived from foreign <span style="">exchange tran</span>sactions, is manifestly
devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transactions from
which said revenues were derived involved the loading of cargo in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the transportation of said cargo to its ports of destination, the delivery of
the cargo to the respective consignees, and the payment of the corresponding
fees to the <span style="">taxpayer's head office at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Ams</span>terdam</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the taxpayer, the transactions
were consummated upon delivery of the cargo to the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the obligations of the
latter or the shipper were discharged upon payment of the freight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the parties to said transaction
were concerned, <u>the same were fully completed upon payment of the fees at </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Amsterdam</u></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question whether or not such fees were to
be remitted by the taxpayer's head office in that City to its branch office in
the Philippines, which had earned it, was one that concerned <u><span style="">exclusively</span></u><span style=""> the </span>former and the latter, it being <u>independent of the rights
and obligations of the parties to the aforementioned transactions</u>, which
were extinguished upon delivery of the cargo at destination and payment of the
freight to said main office of the taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the remittance or non-remittance of said fees could not affect
the nature of said transactions, as involving foreign exchange, <u>not being a
part thereof in any manner whatsoever</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, we take it that - in line with the ordinary course of
business, adherence to which is presumed, in the absence of proof to the
contrary - upon receipt of said freight, the same must have been <u>credited</u>
in the records of the taxpayer's main office in Amsterdam, in favor of its
branch office in the Philippines, and that, upon notice of such payment to the
head office in Amsterdam, the branch office in the Philippines must have, in
turn, <u>debited</u> said fees against its main office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such processes of bookkeeping and accounting
are, for legal purposes, tantamount to delivery, receipt, or remittance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, by so crediting said fees, the
taxpayer's main office in Amsterdam in effect acknowledged being, in a way,
indebted to its Philippine branch, as debited in the latter's records, in much
the same way as the former would have been had it received the fees directly
from the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, this is
in accord with established practice especially among merchants the world over,
who seldom bring or send money physically from one country to another, but,
generally, resort to bills, notes or other conventional forms of transacting
business in the manner they may deem most practical and suitable to their
respective interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the remittances made by the taxpayer's head
office to its Philippine branch, for the operational expenses thereof - or for
any other purposes - must have been credited in the books of account of the
latter in favor of the former, in the records of which they must have been
debited against said branch, and, hence, <u>deducted</u> from its assets in
Amsterdam, including the freight revenues involved herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The infirmity of the taxpayer's theory becomes readily apparent
when We consider that, if upheld, its effect would be to <u>subject to the
carrier's tax</u> at the free market rate all business enterprises that <u>bring</u>
their dollar earnings into the Philippines, and to <u>exempt from such tax</u>
or, apply the parity rate to those who do <u>not</u> bring in their dollars or
other foreign exchange, thereby discriminating <u>against</u> those who help
maintain or increase our international reserve<span style=""> and <u>in favor</u> of those who do not only <u>fail</u> to do so, but
<u>jeopardize</u> the condition of such reserve, by keeping abroad their dollar
</span>and <span style="">other earnings, and, worse
still, by <u>inducing other merchants in the Philippines, </u></span><u>engaged
in a foreign trade, to adopt the same practice, </u><u><span style="">in order to avoid, evade or cut down the payment of said tax</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
result could not surely have been intended or countenanced by the framers of
our tax laws, much less by those responsible for our policy of control and,
later, of gradual decontrol, considering their grave concern for our
international reserve and the stability of the Philippine currency.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of the United States Lines, on which the appealed
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is anchored, refers to transactions that
took place <u>before</u> the approval of Republic Act 2609, on July 16, 1959,
when the <u>only</u> legal rate of exchange obtaining in the Philippines was P2
to $1, and <u>all</u> foreign exchange had to be surrendered to the Central
Bank, subject to its disposition pursuant to its own rules and
regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
present case refers to transactions that took place during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act 2609, when there was, <u>apart
from</u> the parity rate, a legal free market conversion rate for foreign
exchange transactions, which rate had been fixed in open trading, such as those
involved in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
the decision in the case cited contains a phrase suggesting that there can be
no foreign exchange operation when the amount involved therein is not remitted
to the Philippines, this implied pronouncement was a mere <u>obiter</u>, <u>inasmuch
as the result would have been the same had there been a remittance of said
amount</u>, there being, at that time, <u>no</u> other legal rate of exchange
for US dollars than the parity rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, thus, our considered view that the freight revenues
accruing to the taxpayer in the present case, even though collected abroad and
not remitted to its branch office in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
are part of its foreign exchange operations and subject to the common carrier's
tax, computed at the free market rate then prevailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next urged that the 25% surcharge sought to be collected by
the petitioner should not be imposed upon the taxpayer, it having acted in good
faith in doing what it did, for it merely followed the advice of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned surcharge was imposed by
petitioner herein in accordance with Section 183 of the National In<span style="">ternal Revenue Code,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a><span style=""> subdivision
(a) of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a><span style=""> and Republic of the Philippines v.

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros. Co v. Collector of
Internal Revenue<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
Electric Co. v. Court of Tax Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> upon
which the taxpayer relies, are not in point.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first case, the issue was whether the <span style="">sales tax </span>of
5% of the "gross selling price" of certain articles shall be imposed
upon the price set forth in the corresponding invoices, notwithstanding the
fact that the phrase "5% sales tax included" appeared thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question was resolved in the affirmative,
upon the ground that a circular of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, implementing
the law imposing said tax, provided:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Unless billed to the purchaser as separate items in the invoice, the amounts
intended to cover the sales tax shall be considered as part of the gross selling
price of the articles sold, and deductions thereof will not be allowed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and that the taxpayer had not complied
with it since January 18, 1948, - although it had adhered thereto up to then,
by issuing invoices containing an itemization of the actual selling price and
of the 5% sales tax thereon, which was added to the selling price and shifted
to the customer, who paid the total amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that - <u>unlike</u> the taxpayer in
the case at bar, which declared its revenues from February to May 1962 as
P75,003.00, when, in fact, the revenues aggregated P133,855.88 - <span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros. Co. had set forth in its invoices the <u>true</u>
amounts collected from its customers, and the issue hinged merely on the <u>application</u>
of the law thereto, namely, whether the sales tax shall be based upon said
amounts, or should be computed <u>after</u> deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the sum corresponding to the tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
although disagreeing with the position taken by the Bureau of Internal Revenue,
<span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros. had forthwith <u>deposited</u> the
amount assessed by the same, and the deposit was later converted into <u>pay­ment</u>,
followed by a formal request for refund and then, upon denial thereof, by the
corresponding petition for review in the Court of Tax appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <u>upon demand</u>, the amount
representing the taxes sought to be collected by the Government was <u>placed
at the latter's disposal</u>, subject only to the taxpayer's claim that it was
not legally due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the reason for
the imposition of a surcharge - which is non-payment within the period
prescribed by law - <span style="">did </span>not, in
effect, exist in <span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros.' case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second case initially referred to a similar claim for refund
of payments made of the corporate franchise tax - provided in section 259 of
the Tax Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 39, effective in 1946 - of 5% of the
gross earnings or receipts of a corporation that had, since 1930, a municipal
franchise imposing a tax of 1% of the earnings for the first 20 years and 2%
for the next 15 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taxpayer
maintained that the application of the Tax Code impaired its vested rights
under said municipal franchise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
claim for refund had started an exchange of views, between the Bureau of
Internal Revenue and the taxpayer, that dragged for a number of years, culminating,
in September 1961, in an assessment for deficiency franchise tax, for the
period from January 1956 to September 1960, plus 25% surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the claim of impairment of
contractual obligation was overruled, for the reason that the municipal
franchise contained an express reservation that it was subject to amendment or
repeal, We exempted the taxpayer from the payment of the surcharge upon the
authority of the <span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros.' case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regardless of our present opinion on the applicability to the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> case of the view taken in the <span class="SpellE">Connel</span>
Bros.' case concerning the payment of surcharges, the fact is that, in such
case, there had been <u>no</u> failure to pay the tax assessed therein, so that
there really was <u>no</u> legal justification for the imposition of
surcharges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance that <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Electric Co. had <u>begun</u> by demanding a <u>refund</u>
of the <u>payments it had made</u>, for the period from 1948 to 1951, pursuant
to the Tax Code, to which, it later claimed, it could not be made subject
without violating rights vested under its municipal franchise, may, perhaps,
account for the reliance upon the <span class="SpellE">Connel</span> Bros.' case,
although the issue between the electric company and the Government, eventually,
became one for collection of the deficiency franchise tax from 1956 to 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, neither case nor both suffice to outweigh the
above-mentioned six cases declaring that the provision imposing surcharges is
mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged good faith of the
taxpayer herein is - apart from being insufficient to justify a departure from
the rule laid down and repeatedly applied in said cases - merely based upon the
advice said to have been given by its counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering, moreover, that, up to December, 1961, the taxpayer had
reported its earnings at the free market conversion rate - thereby indicating
that such was, in its belief, the rate at which its foreign exchange transactions
should be computed - its change of policy in 1962, allegedly following said
advice of counsel, implied no more than the taking of a calculated risk.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the Court of Tax
Appeals is reversed, and judgment shall be entered affirming that of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, except as to the compromise penalty of
P200.00, which is hereby eliminated, and sentencing respondent corporation,
Royal <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc., to pay to petitioner
herein the sum of P1,471.39, with interest thereon at the legal rate from
January 18, 1963, when it received the letter of demand of said petitioner,
until full payment,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> with
