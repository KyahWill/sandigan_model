filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> petition for </span>consolidation of

right of repurchase within the <span style="">pe</span><span style="">riods </span>stipulated in the two contracts

hearing at which the petitioners presented evidence in support of the petition,
the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">, </span>through Judge Francisco Geronimo,
granted the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July <span style="">19, 1956, </span>the vendors filed a motion
to set aside the Order of January 28, 1955, and on July 27, 1956, the court <u>a</u>
<u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">,</span> through Judge Felix Q. Antonio,
granted the motion on the ground that the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> had
not been duly notified of <span style="">the </span>hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion by the petitioners to set aside the
Order of July 27, 1956, on the ground that the vendors had been notified by registered
mail of the hearing, the lower court, by its <span style="">Order </span><span style="">of February 27,
1957, granted the motion and </span>set aside the Order of July 27, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vendors appealed the Order of <st1:date year="1957" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1957</st1:date> to the Court <span style="">of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1958" day="27" month="6"><span style="">June </span><span style="">27, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">the Court of Appeals rendered judgment in the
appeal setting aside the lower court's Order of </span><st1:date year="1957" day="27" month="2"><span style="">February 27, 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, after holding that the vendors had not been
legally notified of the petition and the hearing, and that the Order of </span><st1:date year="1955" day="28" month="1"><span style="">January
 28, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, was a
patent nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
remanded the record to the lower court for reopening and for further
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, after the
vendors had been duly summoned as respondents, they filed their answer alleging
</span><span style="">that the </span><span style="">two contracts of sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span></span><span style="">
</span><u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <u>retro</u> were really intended as
equitable mortgages </span><span style="">as
securities</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for usurious loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the lower court rendered its
decision on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="10"><span style="">October 26, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, holding that respondents’ allegation was
substantiated by their evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judgment was rendered in favor of their respondents as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders
judgment declaring that Exhibits 2 and <span style="">3
</span>are actually intended by the parties to be Deeds of Equitable Mortgage,
and as such respondents are entitled to redeem the lands described therein, by
paying to the petitioners whatever balance remains of the principal and
interest thereon at 12%, after deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the excess interest paid on November 11, 1952 and September 10, <span style="">1953, </span>and the value of the produce
taken from those properties by petitioners in accordance with the above
findings from <span style="">1955 until </span>the
possession of these properties are returned to respondents, and upon such
settlement, the petitioners are ordered to execute the corresponding release of
mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petition for consolidation of title <span style="">is </span>therefore denied, with costs against petitioners."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petitioners appealed to the Supreme
Court on questions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that the lower court erred in not finding that
the Order of January 28, 1955, was valid, final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
and that all proceedings thereafter taken, <span style="">including</span> the vendors' appeal to the Court of Appeals and its
decision rendered in said appeal setting aside the Order of February <span style="">27, 1957, </span>and <span style="">remanding the case for reopening and further proceed­</span><span style="">ings, as well as </span><span style="">the proceedings thereafter taken including
the decision of October 26, 1960, are null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is untenable in view of the
following considerations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">(1) Article 1607 of the Civil Code which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">In </span>case of
real property, the consolidation of ownership in the vendee by virtue of the
failure of the vendor to comply with the provisions of article 1616 shall not
be recorded in the Registry of Property without a judicial order, after the
vendor has been duly heard."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">contemplates</span> a
contentious proceeding wherein the vendor <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> must be named
respondent in the caption and title of the petition for consolidation of
ownership and duly summoned and heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the caption and title of the petition for
consolidation of ownership named the vendees as petitioners, but did not name
the vendors' as responde<span style="">nts and </span>said
vendors were not duly summoned and heard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view thereof, the Order of January 28, <span style="">1955, </span>was a patent nullity having been issued contrary to the
contentious proceeding contemplated in Article 1607 of the Civil Code, and the
lower court not having acquired jurisdiction over the persons of the vendors;</p>

<blockquote>(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside the Order of
February 27, <span style="">1957, </span>and in
consequence thereof the Order of January 28, 1955, as a patent nullity on the
ground that the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of
the vendors because they had not been duly summoned is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>on the question of nullity of said
orders; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) After the remand to the court below, the proceedings further
taken wherein the vendors were named as <span style="">respondents
</span>and duly summoned and heard, after which on October 26, 1960, the
appealed judgment was rendered in favor of the respondents, were valid, being
in accordance with the contentious proceeding provided for in Article 1607 of
the Civil <span style="">Code.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment of the lower
court of October 26, 1960, is hereby affirmed in all its parts, with costs
against the petitioners-appellants.</p>
