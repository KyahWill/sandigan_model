<span class="SpellE">Tamala</span>, appealed under Republic Act No. 5440 from the
resolution or order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1977</st1:date>
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte
in Civil Case No. 2711 entitled "Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">In that order, the lower court ordered <span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> and her children and children-in-law to vacate
Lot No. 1592, a homestead or coconut land, with an area of eleven hectares
located at <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental, and not to disturb Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> "from the enjoyment" of the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be observed that since the petitioners imputed to the
trial court grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, their
petition also partakes of the nature of a special civil action of certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">The disposition of this case was rendered difficult by the
failure of the parties to make an orderly and chronological statement of the <span class="SpellE">antecedental</span> facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A time-consuming and laborious exami­nation of the pleadings had to be
made in order to ascertain the factual bases for this adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>, a widow and a resident of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sinaad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, was
the registered owner of Lot No. 1592 as shown in Transfer Certificate of Title
No. T-943 issued to her in 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1973</st1:date> she sold that lot under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> for P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim, the wife of Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romula</span> was also the owner of an
eight-hectare lot located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sipaon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte which
she also sold under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> to <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim for P14<span class="GramE">,000</span> on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romula</span> failed to exercise her right of
redemption under the two <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u>
sales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To consolidate their ownership
over those two lots, the spouses Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim sued <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> in September, 1975
in Civil Case No. 2710 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte (referring to the <span class="SpellE">Sipaon</span> lot) and in Civil
Case No. 3131 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental (referring to <span class="SpellE">Baliangao</span> Lot No. 1592).</p>

<p class="BODY">Also in September, 1975, Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> sued <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte for the
recovery of the sum of P22<span class="GramE">,250</span> representing the
amounts which she received from Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> in 1972, 1973 and 1974 for the purchase of
copra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suit was <span class="GramE">filed</span>
because she did not deliver to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> any copra nor returned the money to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">That third case, Civil Case No. 2711, did not reach the trial
stage because the parties and their lawyers submitted to the lower court a
compromise agreement dated <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="4">April 22,
 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compromise
purported to settle not only Civil Case No. 2711 but also the aforementioned <u>Civil
Cases Nos. 2710 and 3131</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
reference, the compromise is reproduced below:</p>

<p class="BODY">On that date, <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="4">April 22,
 1976</st1:date>, when the compromise agreement was signed, it was submitted to
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental which
in its order issued on April 28, dismissed Civil Case No. <u>3131</u>, a case
for consolida­tion of ownership over Lot No. 1592, one of the three cases
compromised by <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>
and Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not show whether the compromise was submitted in
Civil Case No. <u>2710</u> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, another case for consolidation of
owner­ship over another lot of <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The compromise was submitted to that same court in Civil Case No.
<u>2711</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the lower
court, pursuant to the compromise, rendered a judgment dated <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1976</st1:date>, ordering <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> to pay the spouses
Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim Tan the sum of P46<span class="GramE">,000</span>
on or before <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If no payment was made and <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> failed to transfer to the Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> spouses Lot No. 1592, then the spouses may file
a motion for the cancellation of TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-943 and for the
issuance to them of a new title for that lot.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was further ordered in that judgment based on the compromise
that after a new title is issued to the spouses, they would pay to the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span>
debt amounting to P20<span class="GramE">,000</span> plus interest and other
charges and that she and any of her children could <u>repurchase the said lot
within five years from April 22, 1976</u> by paying P46,000 plus the expenses
incurred by the spouses in settling <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span>
obligation to the DBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it should be emphasized that, by virtue of that
compromise and the judgment approving it, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> was given three months (April 22 to July 22, 1976)
within which to settle her total indebtedness of P46<span class="GramE">,000</span>
to the spouses Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In case of non­payment, Lot No. 1592 would be transferred to the said
spouses as a payment of that debt and <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span> debt
of P20<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the DBP, or as a <span class="SpellE"><u>dacion</u></span><u>
en <span class="SpellE">pago</span></u>, but she could repurchase that lot from
the said spouses within a five-year period ending on <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="4">April 21, <u>1981</u></st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, Lot No. 1592, instead of being conveyed to the
spouses Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim for <u>P10<span class="GramE">,000</span></u>,
the price at which <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> sold it in 1973 under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> to <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span>
Lim, would in effect be sold to them for more than P66,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted above, she had failed to redeem Lot
No. 1592 from <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Civil Case No. 3131 was filed
against her for the consolidation of the ownership over that lot by the vendee <u>a
retro</u>, <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The compromise enabled <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> to
reacquire her eight-hectare lot (distinct from Lot No. 1592) which she had sold
under <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> to <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim for P14,000 and which she had not redeemed
within the stipulated period (Civil Case No. 2710).</p>

<p class="BODY">We should not lose sight of these aspects of the compro­mise in
order to dispel the erroneous impression that it was unduly favorable to the spouses
Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim and prejudicial to <span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romula</span> did not pay the sum of P46<span class="GramE">,000</span> as stipulated in the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To enforce the judgment based on that
compromise, the lower court issued on September 1, 1976 a <u>writ of execution</u>
requiring the DBP to accept from Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> the payment of <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span>
debt and ordering the register of deeds of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental to issue a new title to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> for Lot No. 1592 with <u>the annotation of her right
to repur­chase it</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
paid to the DBP on September 7, 1976 the sum of P21<span class="GramE">,101.81</span>
on account of <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span> debt of P20,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of that payment and in conformity
with the writ of execu­tion, <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span> title to Lot
No. 1592 was cancelled and a new one, TCT No. T-5815 (5818) was issued to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> on September 10, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court also issued a <u>writ of possession</u> dated
November 8, 1976 commanding the sheriff to eject <span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> from Lot No. 1592 (p. 59, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff turned over the possession of the
lot to a representative of <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because <span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
did not vacate Lot No. 1592, Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> filed a petition dated December 31, 1976 to de­clare
her and "all the persons acting under her" <u>in</u> <u>contempt of
court</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">She opposed that petition on the grounds that the compro­mise was
vitiated by fraud; that Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>,
being an alien, was disqualified to acquire Lot No. 1592; that the transfer to
him of that lot, which originally was a homestead, was in viola­tion of the
Public Land Law, and that the said lot was owned by her children.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record further discloses that <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span>
eight child­ren, Fe, Amador, Napoleon, Luisa, <span class="SpellE">Genara</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, Nestor and Jesus, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Mangompit</span>, filed a complaint dated December 3, 1976 in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental,
praying that the spouses, Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lagri­mas</span> Lim, be
ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to them Lot No. 1592 (Civil Case
No. 3216).</p>

<p class="BODY">About six months later, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> and her eight children filed in the same court an
action to rescind the amicable settlement and annul the judgment based thereon
which was rendered in Civil Case No. 2711 (Civil Case No. 3256).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>
filed in Civil Case No. 2711 a petition to suspend the contempt proceeding on
the ground that it is criminal in nature and, consequently, a prejudicial
question is allegedly involved in Civil Case No. <u>3256</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the lower court in its order of July 6, 1977
ordered <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> and
all the persons claiming under her (including her children and son-in-law) to
vacate Lot No. 1592 for which a new title had already been issued to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court held that the judgment based
on the compromise was not tainted with fraud and that a contempt charge is not
a criminal offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It announced that if
the lot is not vacated within thirty days from notice, it would continue with
the contempt proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of that order was received by <span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> on August 5, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 3, 1977, she mailed to this
Court her petition under Republic Act No. 5440 for the review of the said order
of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are (1) whether the lower court's judgment based on
the compromise is valid and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and (2) whe­ther
a contempt proceeding is proper in view of the failure of <span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>, her children and son-in-law to vacate Lot No.
1592.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that that judgment is binding and conclusive upon
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its enforcement or execution,
already begun, may be completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, the compromise in question is not a flawless agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its caption should have included Civil Cases
Nos. 2710 and 3131.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms could have
been couched in less <span class="SpellE">involuted</span> language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its provisions could have been simpler and
more concise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And before rendering
judgment, the trial court should have held a hearing and asked <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> categorically in
open court whether she understood the stipulations of the compromise.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have underscored time and again that the trial court should
scrutinize a compromise agreement with utmost care and circumspection so as to
obviate misunderstanding and con­troversy when later on it is sought to be
implemented (<span class="SpellE">Rañeses</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
L-26854, March 4, 1976, 70 SCRA 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding those deficiencies, the compromise and the
judgment based thereon are valid and effective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Romula</span> was assisted by her lawyer when she
signed the compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
personally furnished with a copy of the judgment approving it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already noted, that judgment, which was rendered
on June 18, 1976, had already been partly executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">"A compromise has upon the parties the effect and authority
of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>."
A judicial compromise may be en­forced by writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a compromise in which there is
mistake, fraud, violence, intimidation, undue influence, or falsity of
documents may be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a party
fails or re­fuses to abide by the compromise, the other party may either
enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded and insist upon his original
demand (Arts. 2037, 2038 and 2041, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">A judgment based upon a compromise is more than a mere contract
and, with more reason, it has also the force of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without legal cause, it cannot be unilaterally repudiated by a party (<span class="SpellE">Katipunan</span> Labor Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
[Philippines], Inc., <span class="GramE">101</span> Phil. 1224).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, "a judgment on compromise is not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> and is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
unless a motion is filed to set aside the compromise on the ground of fraud,
mistake or duress, in which event an appeal may be taken from the order denying
the motion" (De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes vs. <span class="SpellE">Ugarte</span>, 75 Phil. 505 and Enriquez vs. Padilla; 77 Phil.
373).</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ugarte</u></span> case, the
reason for the rule is that when both parties enter into an agreement to end a
pending litigation and request that a decision be rendered approving said
agreement, it is only natural to presume that such action constitutes an
implicit waiver of the right to appeal from the decision which waiver is as
undeniable as an express waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a
party to a compromise to reserve the right to appeal from the said decision
"is to adopt an attitude of bad faith which courts cannot
countenance."</p>

<p class="BODY">To be entitled to appeal from a judgment approving a compromise,
a party must move not only to set aside the judg­ment but also to annul or set
aside the compromise itself on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress vitiating
his consent to the compromise (Serrano vs. Reyes, 110 Phil. 536, 542).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To set it aside under Rule 38 of the Rules of
Court, the petition for relief must be filed within six months from the date
the judg­ment was entered (<span class="SpellE">Bodiogan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span>, 102 Phil. 750).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>
did not seasonably move for the setting aside of the compromise and the
judgment based upon it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ins­tead, her
children pretending to be the <u>unregistered owners</u> of Lot No. 1592, filed
a separate action against Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> and his wife for the recovery of Lot No. 1592 (Civil
Case No. 3216).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romula</span>
and her children filed a second case to rescind the compromise and annul the
judgment (Civil Case No. 3256).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal from respondent Judge's order in Civil Case No.
2711, upholding the compromise and the judgment based thereon, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> contends that Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, being an alien, was
incapacitated to acquire Lot No. 1592.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That contention is wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before approving the compromise, the trial court re­quired Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> to prove his
Philippine citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submitted to
the court a certified copy of his Certificate of Naturalization No. 32 issued
by the clerk of court of the lower court on March 18, 1968 in Naturalization
Case No. <span class="GramE">R-50 toge­ther with his oath of allegiance of the
same date.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Philippine
citizenship is an indisputable fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another contention of <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> is that as a mem­ber of the cultural minority she
could not be divested of Lot No. 1592 without the intervention of the proper
government agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She submitted a
certification of the provincial development officer of the governor's office of
<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental stating that she belongs to the <span class="SpellE">Subanon</span> tribe and, as such, she is a mem­ber of the
National Cultural Communities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without so specifying, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale's</span> counsel is re­ferring to section 145(b) of the
Administrative Code of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> and section
120 of the Public Land Law which <span class="GramE">require</span> approval by
the competent authority of conveyances of real pro­perty made by
non-Christians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Mangayao</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lasud</span>, 120 Phil. 154.)</p>

<p class="BODY">That question was not raised in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not adequately argued in petitioner's
memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that in <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span> prior transactions regarding Lot No. 1592 she did
not regard herself as a Non-Christian who should be assisted by the provincial
governor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, she mortgaged that lot to the Philippine National Bank and
the DBP without the intervention and assistance of any government agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her verification of the pleadings in this
case shows that she can legibly sign her name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She does not appear to be illiterate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The compromise in question was approved by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to invoke
section 145 of the Administrative Code of Min­danao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another contention of <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> is that her children were the owners of Lot No. 1592
which they had in fact partitioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
alleged partition was not annotated on TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-943 where­in
it is indubitably indicated that <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> was the
registered owner of Lot No. 1592.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That title was superseded by the new title issued to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> that fraud vitiated her consent to the compromise
cannot be taken seriously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She raised
that question for the first time in her petition dated June 27, 1977 to suspend
the contempt proceeding and in her complaint dated June 17, 1977 in Civil Case
No. 3256.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She <span class="GramE">raised</span>
that issue after the judgment based on the compromise had been partly executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her present counsel conjectured that there was fraud because
Civil Case No. 2711 involved only the sum of <u>P22<span class="GramE">,250</span></u>
whereas <span class="SpellE">Romula's</span> total obligation, as set forth in
the compro­mise agreement, amounted to <u>P46,000</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her counsel overlooked that, aside from the
sum of P22<span class="GramE">,250</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> had
contracted to redeem for P24,000 from <span class="SpellE">Lagrimas</span> Lim
(Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong's</span> wife) Lot
No. 1592 and another lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
in the compromise agreement, her obligation was computed at P46<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> condoned the sum of
P250.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the contempt proceeding, the question is whether
under the judgment based on the compromise the lower court could issue a writ
of possession (as distinguished from a writ of execution) so as to eject from
Lot No. 1592 <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>
and "all the persons acting under her".</p>

<p class="BODY">The compromise and the judgment are silent as to the transfer of
possession to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>
in the event that Lot No. 1592 is registered in his name.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that connection, it should be borne in mind that the law
specifies when a writ of possession may be issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That writ is available (1) in a land
registration proceeding, which is a proceeding <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u>
(Sec. 17, Act No. 496; <span class="SpellE">Estipona</span> vs. Navarro, L-41825,
January 30, 1976, 69 SCRA 285, 291); (2) in an extrajudicial foreclosure of a
realty mortgage (Sec. 7, Act No. 3135); (3) in a judicial foreclosure of
mortgage, a <u>quasi in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u> proceeding, provided
that the mortgagor is in possession of the mortgaged realty and no third
person, not a party to the foreclosure suit, had intervened (Rivera vs. Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Rupac</span>, 61 Phil. 201; Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Mañalac</span> and Lopez, 89 Phil. 270, 275) and (4) in execution
sales (last par. of sec. 35, Rule 39, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the instant case does not fall among the cases mentioned
above, the issuance of the writ of possession was not proper (<span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Arlegui</span>, L-35615
and L-41360, February 17, 1977, 75 SCRA 234, 244).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the writ of possession was <u>addressed to the sheriff</u>
(p. 59, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the petitioners herein could not have been guilty of disobeying
that writ and, there­fore, they could not be held liable for contempt of court
(<span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Arlegui</span>, <u>supra</u>;
Mendoza vs. <span class="SpellE">Alano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salceda</span>,
112 Phil. 445; U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramayrat</span>, 22 Phil. 183).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the ultimate analysis, the issue is whether because Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> is now the registered
owner of Lot No. 1592 by virtue of the judgment based on the compromise, the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte in
Civil Case No. 2711 can order <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> to deliver the possession of that lot to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> in spite of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 3256 in the <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental Court for the annul­ment of the said judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that if the claim of <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span>, her children and son-in-law to retain possession of
Lot No. 1592 is based merely on her ownership, which was terminated by the
issuance of a new title to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>, then the trial court, to avoid multiplicity of
suits, may order her, her children and son-in-law (the petitioners herein) to
vacate that lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Squarely applicable to
the situation herein is the following ruling:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>"Judgment; When Adjudication of Ownership does not
Include Possession; Case at Bar</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
adjudication of owner­ship does not include possession of the property where
the actual possessor has a valid right over the property enforceable even
against the owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An example is
the case of tenants and lessees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
doctrine, however, may not be invoked in instances where no such right may be
appreciated in favor of the possessor.</p>

<p class="BODY">"In the instant case, considering that appellants have no
other claim to the possession of the property in question, apart from their
claim of ownership which was rejected by the lower court and, consequently,
have no right to remain therein after such ownership was adjudged to <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the delivery of posses­sion of the land should
be considered included in the adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Indeed, it would be defeating the ends of justice should
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> be required to submit to court
litigations anew in order to obtain possession of the property duly adjudged to
be theirs, from those who have no right to remain therein." <span class="GramE">(Sylla­bus, Perez and <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Evite</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manigbas</span>, 111 Phil.
564).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is no showing that the peti­tioners
can justify their right to possess Lot No. 1592 on a ground distinct from their
claim of ownership which claim, as noted above, cannot be sustained because the
title over that lot is now in Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong's</span> name.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' last contention is that a prejudicial question is
involved in Civil Case No. 3256 because the contempt pro­ceeding against them
is criminal in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already
ruled that the contempt proceeding is not proper against the petitioners since
the writ of possession was directed to the she­riff and not to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the supposed contempt is not criminal in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is civil in nature because it consists in
the failure to do something for the benefit of a party (3 Moran's Comments on
the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed., <span class="GramE">p</span>. 343).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' theory that a prejudicial
question is involved in Civil Case No. 3256 and that, for that reason, the
contempt proceeding in Civil Case No. 2711 should be suspended, is not correct.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court's resolution ordering <span class="SpellE">Romula</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabale</span> and all those
holding under her to vacate Lot No. 1592 is affirmed but with the modification
that they should deliver the possession of the said lot to Tan <span class="SpellE">Tian</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> within sixty (60) days
from the date this judgment becomes final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.'</p>
