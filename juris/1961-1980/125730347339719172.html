				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition for certiorari to annul the order of the Honorable 
Baltazar M. Villanueva of the Court of Industrial Relations and the resolution 
of that Court <i>en banc </i>denying a motion to dismiss filed by petitioner as 
respondent in Case No. 13-V-Pang., entitled "Jacinto Arcilla, et al., 
petitioners, <i>vs.</i> Sergio F. Naguiat, respondent."</p>
<p>It appears that respondents were former employees of petitioner, in his 
construction business in Angeles, Pampanga. On January 8, 1959, they sued 
petitioner in the the Court of Industrial Eelations for the recovery of basic 
and extra compensation for work done on Sundays and holidays under Section 4 of 
the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444, as amended) during the 
period 1956-1957. </p>
<p>In his answer, petitioner, among other things, questioned the jurisdiction of 
the Court of Indusrtial Relations and raised the issue anew in a motion to 
dismiss which he subsequently filed, but the Honorable Baltazar M. Villanueva 
upheld his jurisdiction over the case in an order dated September 19, 1959, 
relying on our ruling in Monares <i>vs.</i> CNS Enterprises, et al., G. R. No. 
L-11749, May 29, 1959. Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the order but the 
Court, sitting <em>en banc</em>, affirmed the disputed, order in a resolution 
dated December 1, 1959. Hence, this petition, petitioner contending, among other 
things, that the Court of Industrial Relations had no jurisdiction over the 
case. </p>
<p>While this case was pending, this Court clarified its previous rulings on the 
jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations and held in Price 
Stabilization Corp. <i>vs.</i> Court of Industrial Relations, et al., G. R. No. 
L-13206, May 23, 1960 that-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Analyzing these cases, the underlying principle, it will be noted in all of 
them, though not stated in express terms, is that where the employer-employee 
relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished because of its 
wrongful severance (as where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of 
Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or in 
connection with the employment, such as those related to the Minimum Wage Law 
and the Eight-Hour Labor Law. After the termination of their relationship and no 
reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within 
the jurisdiction of the regular courts.</p>
<p>"We are aware that in 2 cases, some statements implying a different view have 
been made, but we now hold and declare the principle set forth in the next 
preceding paragraph as the one governing all cases of this nature." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since, at the time of the filing of the complaint, the employer-employee 
relationship of the parties had been terminated and there being no petition for 
reinstatement, the claims of respondents Jacinto Arcilla, et al. did not come 
within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations. </p>
<p>In their memorandum in lieu of oral argument, however, respondents ask that 
we re-examine the doctrine of the Frisco case. They contend that the Court of 
Industrial Relations was created to afford, protection to labor and that Section 
1 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 confers broad powers on the Court of Industrial 
Relations "to consider, investigate, decide, and settle all questions, matters, 
controversies, or disputes arising between and/or affecting employers and 
employees or laborers * * * and regulate the relations between them" regardless 
of the existence of employer-employees relationship between the parties. </p>
<p>There is no merit in the contention. Even Section 1 of the law, which 
respondents invoke, negates their stand. This section makes it plain that the 
broad grant of powers to the Court of Industrial Relations refers only to 
matters, controversies or disputes "arising between, and/or affecting employers 
and employees." </p>
<p>We find no reason to depart from the ruling in the Prisco case. The doctrine 
of the Prisco case has been reiterated in a long line of decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It is now the rule on the matter. A 
restatement of this doctrine is found in Campos, et al. <i>vs.</i> Manila 
Railroad Co., et al., G. R. No. L-17905, May 25, 1962, in which We held that for 
the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations to come into play, the 
following requisites must be complied with: (a) there must exist between the 
parties an employer-employee relationship or the claimant must seek his 
reinstatement; and (b) the controversy must relate to a case certified by the 
President of the Court of Industrial Relations as one involving national 
interest, or must have a bearing on an unfair labor practice charge, or must 
arise either under the Eight-Hour Labor, Law or under the Minimum Wage Law. In 
default of any of these circumstances, the claim becomes a mere, money claim 
that comes under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the Order of September 19, 1959 and the resolution of December 1, 
1959 of the Court of Industrial Relations are hereby set aside, without 
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
