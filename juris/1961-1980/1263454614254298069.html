from an order of dismissal of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span> was chief baker for
the De <span class="SpellE">Lux</span> Bakery and Grocery, in <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, from June 18, 1959 to October 8, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 14, 1961, he filed, with the
municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>,
a complaint, against defendant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span>, as
owner of said establishment, to recover the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,056.00</span>,
for unpaid overtime services allegedly rendered during said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court having later dis­missed said
complaint, <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span> appealed to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, where the case was docketed as
Civil Case No. 1800.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, or on January 24, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span>
filed, with the same Court of First Instance, another complaint against <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span>, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 1804, to
recover the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span>, he was granted, on
<st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1963</st1:date>, an
extension of 30 days, "counted from to-day," to submit his
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 8, 1963, he filed, instead,
a motion to dismiss, upon the ground that said pending case No. 1800 is an
action between the same parties, for the same cause of action, and that the
complaint in case No. 1804 violates "the rule against splitting a cause of
action." Subsequently, or on March 12, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span>
sought to have <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span> declared in default, upon the
ground that his motion to dismiss had been filed one (1) day late, and that it
was merely <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>, because of which it did not suspend the
running of the period to file his answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of First Instance granted the motion to dismiss and denied the
motion to declare <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span> in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reconsideration of the orders to this
effect having been denied, <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span> interposed the
present appeal, directly to the Supreme Court, alleging that the lower court
had erred (a) in not declaring <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span> in default; and
(b) in dismissing the complaint herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first alleged error, <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span>
maintains that the extension of 30 days granted in the order of February 6,
1963, ex­pired on March 7, 1963, because the order stated that said period
should be "counted from today," which, <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span>
maintains, should be understood to mean from February 6 to March 7, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An identical theory was rejected in <span class="SpellE">Ulpiando</span> vs. Court of Agrarian Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> in
the following language:</p>

<blockquote>"The petitioners raise procedural questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 2 August 1957 the respondents received a
copy of the decision dated 22 July <span class="GramE">1957<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>See Annexes E &amp; F).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 15 August they filed a petition for
extension of time to file motion for reconsideration, dated 13 August, because
of lack of material time to read the voluminous transcript of stenographic
notes and for that reason they could not readily formulate their arguments in
support of the motion for reconsidera­tion (Annex F).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, 15 August, the Court entered
an order granting the respondents ‘fifteen (15) days <u>counted from today</u>
within which to file their motion for reconsideration of the decision rendered
on July 29, 1957 (should be 22) in the instant case.' (Underscoring
supplied.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 30, the respondents
mailed their motion for reconsideration in the post office of <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners claim that counting from 15
August, the day the 15-day period commenced to run, to 30 August, when the
respondents mailed their motion for reconsideration, 16 days already had
elapsed, and <span class="GramE">contend</span> that the Court had already lost
jurisdiction of the case and could no longer reconsider its decision dated 22
July.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rule 28 of the Rules of Court provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these
rules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act,
event, or, default after which the designated period of time begins to run is
not to be included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last day of the
period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Sunday or a legal holiday,
in which event the time shall run until the end of the next day which is
neither a Sunday nor a holiday.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">This rule adopts the exclude-the-first and
include</span> ­the-last day method for computing any period of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, excluding the day when the order
granting their petition for extension of time to file motion for
reconsideration was entered by the Court (15 August) and including the day the
respondents mailed their motion for reconsideration (30 August), only 15 days
had elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respondents'
motion for reconsideration was filed within the extension of time granted by
the Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No reason has been advanced, and we find none, to depart from
this view, which is in line with the spirit and the letter of our laws and the
rules of Court, and is, accordingly, reiterated.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second procedural ground of the objection to the
motion to dismiss, it should be noted that a motion is said to be <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>
when it is apparent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> has not endeavor­ed to make it reasonably persuasive
or convincing, his purpose being merely to gain time or to delay the
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the
motion explicitly states "that there is another actions pending between
the same parties for the same cause, namely: Luis <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span>
vs. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span> – Civil Case No. 1800, now pending
be­fore this Honorable Court;" and "that the filing of the
above-entitled case is a violation of the rule against splitting a cause of
action."</p>

<p class="BODY">Having thus expressed, not only the legal grounds for the mo­tion,
but, also, the particular and concrete facts upon which said grounds rely –
with specification of the title and number of the case on which the motion was
based and of the court before which the case is pending, coupled with the other
circumstances hereinafter adverted to and appearing in the records of both
cases-said motion, mani­festly, is not pro forma,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> and its presentation suspended the
running of the period for the filing of defendant’s answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next and most important question for determination is whe­ther
or not Civil Case No. 1800 is for the same cause of action as Civil Case No.
1804, both being admittedly between the same parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it should be noted that
the basis of the complaints in both cases is the same, namely: that <span class="SpellE">Enguerra's</span> rights as <span class="SpellE">Dolosa's</span>
chief baker, from June 18, 1959 to October 8, 1961, have been vio­lated by the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged violations may have
several aspects, such as: 1) underpayment of wages; 2) nonpayment of overtime;
3) transfer, allegedly equivalent to unjustified dismissal, and, hence, the
claim for separation pay; and 4) damages (compensatory, moral and exemplary,
and attorney's fees).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the cause of
action – the spring from which the right to sue emanates – was only <u>one</u>
and the same breach of their contract of employment, without which none of the
claims made by plaintiff would have no leg to stand on.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statutory provisions regarding termination pay, minimum wage,
overtime and damages are <u>as much a part of said contract of employment, as
the pertinent provisions of the Civil Code</u> on obligations and contracts, in
general, and on lease of services, in parti­cular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference between underpayment of wages
on a given day and nonpayment of overtime for work done on the same day, is not
- insofar as the cause of action <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is
concerned materially at variance from that which exists between said
underpayment of wages for the day given and the similar underpayment of wages
for the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if <u>one
month later</u>, the aggrieved laborer should decide to sue the employer for
breach of contract, it is ob­vious that the former cannot file a complaint for <u>some</u>
effects of such breach, and <u>another</u> complaint or its <u>other</u>
effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must it include in the
complaint his claim for underpayment for the aforemen­tioned two (2) days, both
being overdue at the time of the commencement of the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
Similarly, if underpayment of the minimum wage for a given day or month were
coupled with failure or refusal to pay overtime, for the same day or month, a
complaint filed thereafter should include both, underpayment of wages and
overtime pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Courts
should not sanction a complaint for <span class="GramE">one,</span> and another
action for the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in his own
complaint herein plaintiff has, in fact, included his claims for alleged
underpayment of wages, overtime, compensatory, moral and exemplary damages, and
attorney’s fees, under <u>one</u> cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">He is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, therefore, to deny
that the cause of action asserted in both cases is one and the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it is clear that the overtime
claimed in the present case is the very object of Case No. 1800.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is well settled that damages
incidental to a cause of action cannot be made the subject of a suit
independent from the principal cause.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed, with costs against plaintiff, Luis <span class="SpellE">Enguerra</span>.</p>
