defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balbar</span> allegedly entered the room where schoolteacher
Ester Gonzales, complainant herein, was conducting her classes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without <span style="">warning and </span>right after complainant had
finished writing on the blackboard, defendant allegedly placed his arms around
her and kissed her on the eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shocked,
complainant instinctively pushed <span class="SpellE">Balbar</span> away and
tried to flee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant allegedly
brought out his "<span class="SpellE">daga</span>" <span style="">(a </span>local
dagger) and pursued complainant, catching up with her before she was able to
get out of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant embraced
her again, at the same time holding on to his "<span class="SpellE">daga</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both fell to the floor, as <span style="">a </span>result of
which complainant sustained slight physical injuries.</p>

Assistant Provincial Fiscal against defendant before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, the latter charge upon written
complaint <span style="">filed
</span>by the offended party, <span style="">duly sworn to before the Clerk of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The

Province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, Phi­lippines, and within the

Miss Ester Gonzales, a public school teacher in the school building of <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>, duly qualified and appointed as such and while in the

Province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, Philippines and within the

close to her, embracing and kissing her against her will and by means of force,

thereof <span style="">said
</span>offended party fell to the floor resulting to her injury which caused
her pain and tenderness on the right side of<span style=""> </span><span style="">the trunk on the
posterior surface of the right arm which injuries may re­quire 3 to 4 days to
heal; that the crime was committed with the aggravating circumstance that the
same was perpetrated inside the public school building and during class hour.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"CONTRARY TO LAW."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
accused filed separate motions to quash, con­tending that “(a) with respect to
Criminal Case No. 823 for Direct Assault, the information does not charge a
sufficient cause of action and that it charges two of­fenses in a single
complaint; and (b) with respect to Criminal Case No. 841 for Acts of
Lasciviousness, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that
the accused would be placed in double jeopardy and that the complaint charges
two offenses." On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="8"><span style="">August 16, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, over the
opposition of the Assistant Provincial Fiscal, the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> issued an order quashing the two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Said the</span><span style=""> court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After reading the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in
both criminal cases, the Court agrees with counsel that the acts committed by
the ac­cused as alleged in the two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
constitute one offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regards the motion to quash filed in Criminal Case No.
841, the grounds alleged in support thereof are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the accused would be placed in
double jeopardy; and (2) that the criminal complaint charges two of­fenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without discussing the merits of these
grounds above-quoted, the Court believes that the information filed in Criminal
Case No. 841 should be dismissed or quashed for the reason that the offense
charged therein is already absorbed in the offense charged in Criminal Case No.
823."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the order reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it <span style="">is </span>the
opinion of this Court that the information in Criminal Case No. 823 which
charges only unjust vexation or physical injuries should be quashed for the
reason that the same is within the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the
Peace. And, <span style="">as </span>to the
information in Criminal Case No. 841, the same should likewise be quashed on
the ground that the acts complained of is already included in Criminal Case No.
823."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From
this order, the Government interposed the </span><span style="">present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Stated differently in the
rationale of its order, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> quashed Criminal Case No. 823 on the following ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That "while the offense is designated as
direct assault, nevertheless the main allegations of the information may at
most constitute unjust vexation for the reason that </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">important element of the crime of direct
assault <span style="">is </span>conspicuously absent
in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This essential
element is the knowledge of the accused that the victim <span style="">is </span></span><span style="">a </span><span style="">person in
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> This being the case and since x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> sufficient allegations are contained in the
information in question to hold the accused responsible for the offense, the
Court believes that the information <span style="">is
</span>sufficient in substance to at least constitute unjust vexation or
physical injuries."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Direct assault is
committed “by any person or </span><span style="">persons who, </span><span style="">without a public uprising, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall attack, employ force, or seriously intimidate or
resist any person in authority or any of his agents, while engaged in the
performance of official duties, or on occasion of such performance.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Art. 148, Revised Penal Code.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">By express provision of
law (Com. Act No. 578, now part of Article 152 of the Revised Penal Code, as
amended by Republic Act No. 1978), "teachers, professors, and persons
charged with the supervision of public or duly recognized private schools,
colleges and universities </span><span style="">shall be </span><span style="">deemed persons in authority, in applying the provisions of Article
148." This special classification is obviously intended to give teachers
protection, dignity, and respect </span><span style="">while </span><span style="">in
the performance of their official duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">The
lower </span><span style="">court,
however, dismissed the information on the </span><span style="">ground </span><span style="">that there is no express allegation in the
information </span><span style="">that the </span><span style="">accused had knowledge that the person attacked was a person in
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly erroneous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainant was a teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information suffi­ciently alleges that
the accused knew that fact, <span style="">since </span>she
was in her classroom and engaged in the performance of her duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore knew that she was a person in
authority, as she was so by specific provision of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It matters not that such knowledge on his
part is not expressly alleged, complainant's status as a person in authority
being a matter of law and not of fact, ignorance whereof could not excuse
non-compliance on his part </span><span style="">(Article 3, </span><span style="">Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This article applies
to all kinds of </span><span style="">domestic laws, whether </span><span style="">civil
or penal (De Luna vs. <span class="SpellE">Linatoc</span>, 74 Phil. 15) a</span><span style="">nd whether substantive or remedial (<span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>, 1 Phil. 254)
for <span style="">reasons of expediency, policy and
necessity.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
dismissal of the information for Acts of Lasciviousness, we agree with the
conclusion reached by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Although
it <span style="">is </span>true that the same acts
may constitute more than one offense, we are of the opinion, upon an
examination of the events which gave rise to the filing of the <span style="">two aforementioned <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">informations</span></span><span class="GramE">, <span style="">that</span></span></span> the offense of
Acts of Lasciviousness does not appear to have been committed at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It would be somewhat difficult to lay down any rule
specifically establishing just what conduct makes one amenable to the
provisions of article 439 (now article 336) of the Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What <span style="">constitutes
lewd or lascivious </span>conduct must be determined from the circumstances of
each case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be quite easy to
determine in <span style="">a
</span>parti­cular case that certain acts are lewd and lascivious, and it may
be extremely diffi­cult <span style="">in </span>another
case to <span style="">say </span>just
<span style="">where the line of demarcation lies
between such conduct and </span>the amorous advances of an ar­dent lover."
(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs.
Gomez, 30 Phil. 22, 25).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The presence or absence
of lewd designs is inferred from the nature of the acts themselves and the
environ­mental circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, considering <span style="">the manner,
place and time under which the acts complained of were done, even as alleged </span>in
the information itself, lewd designs can hardly </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">attributed to accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The
factual setting, i.e., </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">schoolroom
<span style="">in the presence of complainant's
students and within hearing distance of her co-teachers, rules out a conclusion
that the accused was actuated </span>by </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">lustful design or purpose or that his con­duct was lewd or
lascivious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that he <span style="">did embrace the girl and kiss her but this of
itself would not necessarily </span>bring the case within the provision of
Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Wherefore, the order of
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> quashing the <span style="">information for Direct Assault </span></span><span style="">is hereby set</span><span style=""> aside <span style="">and this case is
remanded to the lower court for trial on </span>the <span style="">merits; and with respect to the dismissal </span>of <span style="">the information for Acts of Lasciviousness,
the same is here­by affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement
as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
