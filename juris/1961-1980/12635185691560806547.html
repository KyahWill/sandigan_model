				<H3>JOSE REYES, SOLEDAD
REYES & CARMELITA REYES DE PASTOR, PETITIONERS, VS. HON.
FRANCISCO ARCA, PRE­SIDING JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA,
BRANCH I, AND EUSEBIO MILLAR, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case was interposed by petitioners Reyes to seek a writ of
mandamus against respondents, to compel them to comply with the decision of
this Court promulgated on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">29 November
 1965</st1:date>, in Case <span style="">G. </span><span style="">R. </span>No. <span class="GramE">L-21447,
having an identical title as the present one.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Feliciano and <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Basa</span> had in 1943 leased certain premises in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Millar at a monthly rent of P320.00 a
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease contract contained a
stipulation granting the lessee option to buy the property if the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> decided to sell the same, such stipulation to be
respected by a third party buyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1953 the <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> sold the property
to herein petitioners, who agreed to respect the lease of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
Millar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1954 the lessee filed action
in the Court of First Instance presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>
to compel the petitioners to sell the property to him, conformably to he option
granted in the lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
new <span class="SpellE">lessors</span> resisted the action, claiming that the
option had been waived, they moved that, pending resolution of Millar's action,
said lessee be required to deposit in court the rentals that had accumulated
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge having denied their motion,
petitioners came to this Court in certiorari G. R. No. 21447). </p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">29 November 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">We</span> rendered judgment, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is granted, the orders
dated March 20 and <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1963</st1:date>
are set aside, and respondent <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Millar is
ordered to deposit with the trial court the sum of P16<span class="GramE">,640.00</span>
for rentals from January 1959 to April 1963, and monthly rentals of P320.00 for
every month thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid judgment having become final, and Millar failing to
make the deposit ordered, petitioners asked respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> to cite Millar for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge denied their motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, petitioners asked that a writ of
execution be issued to enforce the final decision of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, Judge <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>
declined to do so, by order of <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="1">5
 January 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, the
petitioners once more resorted to this Supreme Court for a writ <span style="">a </span>mandamus.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contumacious conduct of Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>,
in repeatedly refusing to enforce a final decision of this Court, is plain on
the record.</p>

<blockquote>“. . . . . . . . . . . . .As already observed by this court in <span class="SpellE">Shioji</span> vs. Harvey (<span style="">[</span>1922],
43 Phil., 333, 337), and reiterated in subsequent cases, "if each and
every Court of First Instance could enjoy the privilege of overruling decisions
of the Supreme Court, there would be no end to litigation, and judicial chaos
would result." A be­coming modesty of inferior courts demands on conscious
realization of the position that they occupy in the interrelation and operation
of the integrated judicial system of the nation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this appeal,
however, two developments occurred: Judge <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>
retired from the service and Judge Jose A. Bautista, to whom Millar's case to
enforce his option had been referred, rendered a decision requiring the petitioners
herein to sell the property to the plaintiff, and his decision has become final
by failure to perfect an appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said decision of the Court of First Instance (in its Civil Case
No. 20396) also declared null and void the sale of the pro­perty by <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Basa</span> in favor of Jose
Reyes, et al. (petitioners herein) and ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel
the Certificate of Title issued in their favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, enforcement of our previous 1965
decision requiring respondent Millar to deposit the rentals of the pro­perty
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the suit in the Court of First
Instance would now serve no useful purpose, the petitioners' rights as vendees­-<span class="SpellE">lessors</span> having been already nullified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(And the retirement of ex-judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> prevents his being called to account for his refusal
to enforce our decision.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the above entitled case is hereby dismissed,
for having become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without costs.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
