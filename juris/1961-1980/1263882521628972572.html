a forty-year old computer in a surveyor's office, charged Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span> (admitted to
the bar in 1962) with unethical conduct and negligence in handling defendants'
appeal in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 1962-A of the city court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>

defendants and <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> replaced him and hired Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
prosecute the appeal, <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>, in his behalf and as

<p class="BODY">The appeal was duly perfected by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arranged the execution of a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond by a surety company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was docketed in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in June, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no movement in the case and
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span> did not do anything to set it for
hearing, <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> sent a telegram to this Court,
requesting that the lower court be directed to expedite the hearing of the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">That telegram provoked Judge Vicente N. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>,
Jr. to set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on
that date, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span> made his one and only
appearance in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What transpired
at that brief hearing is shown below:</p>

attention.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the telegram:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Due to coercion by the complainants, our case on appeal in the
Court of First Instance, <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> of Judge <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> was erroneously decided by the city court to which
Hector Llamas has no title, no improvement and no award from the NAFCO on the
property by first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the Presidential
Assistant . . . '</p>

<blockquote>This was referred to the

<blockquote>"COURT:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All right, submitted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The next day, January 19, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> decided
the case by affirming the city court's decision against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rehired their former lawyer, Atty.
Fernandez, to appeal the case to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, they lost the case in that Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Seventeen days after Judge <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> decided
the case, or on <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1974</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> denounced Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span>
to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
"as a lawyer (who) should not exist in our new society."</p>

<p class="BODY">That denunciation was referred to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span>, in
his answer to the complaint, branded it as malicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the investigation, he accounted for
the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,563.50</span> by stating that his attorney's
fees amounted to P730 and he paid P404.30 as premium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He accounted for the balance of P429.20 by
stating that he posted an appeal bond of P60 and spent some unspecified amounts
for getting copies of the records of the case and for the registration of the
mortgage deed executed by <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> in favor of the
surety company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent prepared
and notarized that mortgage deed which was a sort of <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was registered in <span class="SpellE">Tagum</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del Norte, which is fifty-five kilometers away
from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span> paid
twenty pesos for docketing the appeal in the Court of First Instance and
deposited fifty pesos as appeal bond (Sec. 3, Rule 40 and sec. 5[a][12], Rule
141, Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal bond of
P60 would be an undertaking, not a cash bond), that would leave the sum of
P359.20 as the amount which he spent in registering the mortgage and getting
copies of the records of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Atty. Fernandez did not turn over to him his personal records).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> alleged in his complaint that
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span> should have spent P120 for the
transcripts of the testimonies in the city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent did not get those
transcripts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His accounting of the
balance of P429.20 is not quite clear and exact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the hazy accounting, <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>
complains that the services rendered by the respondent were not satisfactory
because he appeared in court only once and he did not submit any memorandum or
oral argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent claims that "with the perfection of the
appeal and the submission of the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond to
stay the execution", he had adequately performed his commitment to his
clients; that there was no necessity of filing a new memorandum since the
memorandum of Atty. Fernandez in the city court was sufficient for the purpose,
and that he was not able to argue orally, although he was prepared to do so,
because Judge <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> was busy with other cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The issue is whether
disciplinary action should be taken against the respondent in connection with
his handling of the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> admitted to
him that he (<span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>) was constrained to file a
complaint against the respondent because the defendants in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit suspected that <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>
had misappropriated the money which they had entrusted to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent said that <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>
was willing to withdraw the complaint provided that he (the respondent)
returned P500 to <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> or provided that the respondent
paid the back premiums for two years on the surety bond so that the lot
mortgaged by <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> to the bonding company could be
released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent rejected the
proposals of <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also said that at the outset he told <span class="SpellE">Ballos</span>
that the defendants had very slim chances of winning the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ballos</span> manifested at the commencement
of the investigation that he would withdraw his complaint if the mortgage on
his lot were cancelled.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a study of the evidence and the contentions of the parties,
our conclusion is that the respondent is not entitled to a complete
exoneration, as recommended by the Acting Solicitor General and the
investigating fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent should have realized when he accepted the case and
after he had received the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,563.50</span> (the
hard-earned savings of his poor clients), that they had pinned their hopes on
him for reversing the city court's unfavorable verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent should have known that,
because his clients changed lawyers, they wanted a more vigorous and aggressive
advocacy of their cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, according
to the respondent, the defendants' case was weak and could hardly prosper on
appeal, he could have advised them to continue the retainer of their first
lawyer, Atty. Fernandez, who was more knowledgeable about the case than the
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from perfecting the appeal and staying the execution
pending appeal, the respondent really did nothing in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, he did not render an unimpeachable
accounting of the moneys which he had received in installments.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the respondent does not merit disbarment or suspension,
because he did not commit any gross misconduct or dishonesty, he should at
least be given an admonition or warning to be more conscientious in the
performance of his duties to his clients and to be more scrupulous and
circumspect in handling their funds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent is admonished to be more careful
and discreet in handling the funds of his clients and to be more zealous and
dedicated in attending to their interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A copy of this decision should be attached to respondent's personal
record.</p>
