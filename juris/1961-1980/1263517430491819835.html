First Instance of Manila, Branch VIII.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was sometime in the middle part of 1964 that <span class="SpellE">Armingol</span> <span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span> y <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> met Guillermo Literal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relations between the two thereafter
became so close that Literal went to live with <span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span>
in January 1965 in the latter's house at <span class="SpellE">Manga</span>
Avenue, Sta. Mesa, Manila, where he worked as a helper in the latter's business
of buying and selling appliances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
time <span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span> suc­ceeded in prevailing upon Literal to
insure himself for P10,000 with the Philippine American Life Insurance Company,
making <span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span> - who then assumed the name Jose N.
Literal and repre­sented himself as the younger brother of Guillermo Literal -
the principal beneficiary thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1965</st1:date> the correspond­ing
application was accomplished and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by
Guillermo Literal who was illiterate.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The life insurance policy was approved and issued that same day, March 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span> thereafter
waited for the opportune time to poison Guillermo Literal with arsenic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opportunity presented itself on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His own nar­ration of the events that
transpired on March 25 and thereafter, contained in his sworn extrajudicial
confession given to the Natio­nal Bureau of Investigation on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did you give the arsenic poison?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early that day sir, GUILLERMO went to Santa
Mesa market and bought around ten (10) '<span class="SpellE">Galungong</span>'
fish and fruits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made the <span class="SpellE">galungong</span> into '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span>.' This
time my mind was made up that I will poison him (GUILLERMO) already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because I did not want REBECCA to take the
poison accident­ally, I asked her to go to our neighbors and play there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When our dinner was ready, the table was set
already, i.e., the rice and '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>' were already on the
table I poured the arsenic solution on his plate of rice and also on the <span class="SpellE">paksiw</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
GUILLERMO that I did not like or feel like eating <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>
that day and I only took fried eggs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How were you able to pour the arsenic solu­tion
on the plate of GUILLERMO and on the <span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> without
his seeing you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I asked him to get water to drink, he
stood and when his back was turned I poured the solution on his plate and on
the <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you see if GUILLERMO consumed his rice and
the '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>’?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About three-fourths (3/4) of his plate of
rice and around six (6) of the <span class="SpellE">galungong</span> sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How about the sauce of the <span class="SpellE">paksiw</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He drank part of it sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How long did it take before the effects of
arsenic poison showed on GUILLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After we finished eating sir, it must be more
than an hour when he started <span class="SpellE">vomitting</span>, he complained
of dizziness and after a little later sir he started having loose bowels sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did you do with the remainder of the '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>'?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I threw it away sir, including the rice left
in <span class="SpellE">GUILLERMO's</span> plate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did you do when GUILLERMO started showing
signs of the effect of arsenic poison­ing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing sir, I just watched him and when he
asked for hot water in a bottle to be placed over his stomach I gave it to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you not bring him immediately to a doc­tor
or to a hospital?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not sure of the date and time sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I think I brought him (GUILLERMO) to a
doctor the same afternoon <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25,
 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are you sure it was on the 25th of March that
you brought GUILLERMO to see a doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not sure of the dates anymore sir, but I
remember bringing him to a doctor sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time you gave the poison, i.e.,
lunchtime <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>,
up to the time you brought GUILLERMO to a doctor, what have you done to alleviate
his sickness or suffer­ings?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing sir.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When GUILLERMO asked me to heat water for him to take a bath and I
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me for medicine but I told
him there was none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me to get
him a doctor and I went to <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. LIGAYA C. SANTOS but
she was not home at that time as I was inform­ed she was in school.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you ever bring GUILLERMO to a doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I brought him later that afternoon to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. LIGAYA <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, tell us, when for the first time did you
bring GUILLERMO to <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Late in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date> sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What did you tell <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
<st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city> when you ac­companied
GUILLERMO there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A: I
told her that he has been having loose bowel movements after taking those '<span class="SpellE">galungong</span>' fish sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you not inform <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
<st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city> about the ar­senic solution
you poured in the food of GUI­LLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What medicine was given by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>.
<st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She prescribed some tablets sir which I
bought at the drugstore and gave to GUILLERMO to take.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you give GUILLERMO a second dose of the
arsenic solution?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A: <span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more sir, I just gave him that one dose on
his rice and viand that lunchtime of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After giving GUILLERMO those tablets
prescribed by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>,
did his condition improve, i.e., did his <span class="SpellE">vomitting</span>
and loose bowel movements stop?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No sir, it continued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:
Did you bring him again to the doctor when <span class="SpellE">GUILLERMO's</span>
<span class="SpellE">vomitting</span> and loose bowel movements persisted?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No more sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you not bring GUILLERMO to the hospital when
his condition was getting worse?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No sir, because GUILLERMO said the medi­cine
is just enough and he will just finish it and see the outcome.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was GUILLERMO able to consume all the me­dicine
prescribed by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No sir because he died at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1965</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1965</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span> was charged with murder before the Court of
First Instance of Manila, committed, in the language of the information, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 25th day of March, 1965, in the City of
Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with intent to kill, treachery and evi­dent
premeditation, in consideration of a prize and with cruelty, by deliberately
and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, with grave abuse of confidence,
employing craft or fraud and by means of poison, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, un­lawfully and feloniously administer and/or
give ar­senic solution mixed with rice and '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galung­gong</span>' to one Guillermo
Literal, thereby inflicting upon the said Guillermo Literal internal physical
in­juries which were the direct and immediate cause of his death immediately
thereafter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused, duly assisted by counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, voluntarily <u>pleaded guilty</u> to
the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> indictment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this voluntary plea of guilty, the
trial court nevertheless received evidence relative to the aggravating and
mitigating cir­cumstances attendant in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, thereafter rendered judgment
finding the accused guilty be­yond reasonable doubt of murder by means of
poison, with the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and abuse
of confidence, and the mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea of guilty, and
consequently sentenced him to the <u>extreme penalty of death</u>, with the
accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in
the amount of P10,000 and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The automatic elevation of this case to us for review is pursuant
to section 9 of Rule 122 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant poses two issues, formulated by him as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in finding that
Guillermo Literal died from arsenic poisoning; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in discounting
the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and appreciat­ing only the
plea of guilty, thereby failing to offset the two aggravating circumstances of
evident preme­ditation and abuse' of confidence."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. Upon the first issue, the proof of record is indubitable that
the effective cause of the victim's death was arsenic poison­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his statement, exhibit A, given under oath
to the NBI, the appellant admitted that he poured arsenic solution on the rice
and <span class="SpellE"><u>paksiw</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">na</span></u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>galunggong</u></span> that the deceased ate for lunch on
March 25, 1965; that the deceased consumed about three-fourths of the poi­soned
food; and that after an hour, the deceased complained of nausea and then <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> and suffered from loose bowels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is part of his narration:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will you explain to us now why arsenic was
found in the remains of GUILLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because sir, two days before GUILLERMO died I
mixed arsenic in the food of GUILLERMO.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What food?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His rice sir and the '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When did you give arsenic to GUILLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lunchtime sir of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the dining room of our house there at <st1:street><st1:address>682
  <span class="SpellE">Manga</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, Sta. Mesa,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the appellant, through counsel, affirmed his
extrajudicial confession, <span class="SpellE">exh</span>. A, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"A
TTY. RAZON:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever it is in
the confession, we already admitted that."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant now claims that what he poured on the rice and fish
of Guillermo Literal on March 25, 1965 was mere water, quot­ing that part of
his extrajudicial confession which states that "It was the water from this
bottle that I poured on the plate of rice of Guillermo and on the '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galungong</span>'
that lunchtime of March 25, 1965." But the appellant conveniently omitted
to men­tion his admission that he added lye to make the arsenic more soluble
and the resulting solution more potent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus he stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are showing you this bottle, a 200 cc bot­tle
with the cover marked 'Lady's Choice,' half filled with water and about 1/5 of
white precipitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Have you seen this
bottle be­fore?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is the bottle of arsenic sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The white substance on the <span class="SpellE">buttom</span> [<u>sic</u>] sir is the arse­nic and the liquid is
water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the water from this bottle
that I poured on the plate of rice of GUILLERMO and on the '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ga­lungong</span>' that
lunchtime of <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Do you mean to tell us that the liquid in
this bottle is water only</u>?<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>No sir,</u> <u>I
added a little quantity to</u> [<u>sic</u>] <u>LYE there sir to make the
arsenic more soluble and the solution more potent</u>." (emphasis sup­plied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Lorenzo A. <span class="SpellE">Sunico</span> of the NBI, whose
competence as a toxicologist was admitted by the appellant,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
testified that arse­nic oxide is soluble in lye,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> a

<p class="BODY">That the cause of death of the victim was arsenic poisoning was
confirmed by the toxicology report<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
of said Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sunico</span> which recites that the right
pelvic bone taken as a specimen from the ex­humed remains of the deceased was
found positive for traces of arsenic, In his extrajudicial confession, the
appellant gave his ex­press conformity to the foregoing findings:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are you aware that the NBI exhumed the re­mains
of GUILLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you know the reason why?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For laboratory examination sir to determine
the presence of poison sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are showing you this document - Toxico­logy
Report No. T-65-826, with the following FINDINGS:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'spectrographic examination of the right
pelvic bone after <span class="SpellE">ashing</span> gave POSI­TIVE RESULT for
traces of ARSENIC.' This is the result of the general toxicological exa­mination
of the remains of GUILLERMO LI­TERAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you believe this toxicological re­port which you just read?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you are also aware that the specimens
mentioned in this report were taken from the remains of the late GUILLERMO whom
you claimed and insured as your brother?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A: <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The mention of "gastro-enteritis" in the death
certificate<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as the cause of death cannot avail the accused any as the certifi­cate itself
recites that the informant on the matters stated there­in was no other than the
appellant himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not expected
to, as in fact he did not, disclose that the victim died of arsenic poisoning
administered by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead he reported
that the de­ceased died from natural causes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the appellant misled the physician who treated the victim as to
the real cause of the lat­ter's ailment by informing her that the deceased was
suffering merely from loose bowel movement,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and did not inform her that he had administered arsenic solution to the said
deceased.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Upon the second issue, we agree with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
that the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender cannot legally be
credited in favor of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">So that the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender may properly
be appreciated in favor of an accused, the following requisites must concur:
(a) the offender had not been actually ar­rested; (b) the offender surrendered
himself to a person in autho­rity or to an agent of a person in authority; and
(c) the surrender was voluntary.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In his extrajudicial confession, exhibit A, the con­tents of which he
unequivocally affirmed at the trial, the appellant stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>These information you gave us now is con­trary
to your denials in your statement of November 18 and 21, 1965 where you denied
poisoning GUILLERMO for the P10,000.00 insurance</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What made you give this confes­sion to us
now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last night when I was laying [<u>sic</u>]
wide awake at the NBI cell, I came to realize that it would be futile for me to
hide these things from the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Earlier,
<u>I attempted to escape but I was not able to go far and I was recaptured</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sir, thinking about all these things I
realize that the only way I can clear my conscience is to tell you everything
and all the wrong deeds I have done in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact sir, I will tell you now
everything about the death of my niece VIVENCIA HANASAN and that girl ZOSIMA
BALLENTOS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is this that you want to tell us about
VIVENCIA HANASAN and ZOSIMA BALLENTOS?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About their deaths sir, which is almost
similar to the death of REBECCA HERNANDO and GUILLERMO (LITERAL) of which I am
also responsible." (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing for the reception of evidence to prove aggra­vating
and mitigating circumstances, the appellant testified:</p>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it not a fact on December 6 <u>you escaped
the NBI custody</u> that is why you gave the statement on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>I do not exactly remember the date but
that is true</u>.” (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is crystal clear then that the appellant did not surrender
voluntarily to a person in authority or to an agent of a person in
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was being
investigated under NBI custody re­garding the death of one Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Hanasan</span>, he denied in statements he issued on November 13
and 21, 1965 that he poisoned Guillermo Literal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He escaped from NBI custody sometime during
the first week of December but was immediately recaptured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then while under NBI custody again
that, on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1965</st1:date>,
he con­fessed to sole responsibility for the death of Guillermo Literal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Voluntary surrender was no longer possible as
he was already in custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus
no voluntary surrender to speak of since the appellant was in point of fact
arrested.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> appreciated the aggravating
circumstances of evident premeditation and abuse of confidence against the
appel­lant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, a searching study of
the record compels our concur­rence in the court's view.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was sometime in January 1965 that the thought of insuring the
life of Guillermo Literal, with himself as the primary benefi­ciary thereof,
first entered his mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This thought was
translated into a reality on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="3">March 5,
 1965</st1:date> when the deceased (Guillermo) was insured by the Philippine
American Life Insurance Company for P10,000, through the appellant's initiative
and efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he waited for the
opportunity to poison the insured so that he could collect the amount of the
insurance policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opportunity came
on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When did you transfer to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Manga</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around January 1965 sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not sure of the exact date sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you transferred to <st1:street><st1:address>682
  <span class="SpellE">Manga</span> Ave.</st1:address></st1:street>, did
GUILLERMO join you immediately?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No sir, after about two (2) weeks later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When for the first time did you think of
insuring GUILLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After he has stayed with me for about two (2)
weeks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whose idea was it to have GUILLERMO in­sured?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was present when one (1) underwriter came
to the house and talked about insurance and he (GUILLERMO) told me what was
this (insurance) all about and I explained to him the benefits of insurance
until he was con­vinced to get one for himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before this insurance underwriter came to your
house, did you have any other agreement with GUILLERMO concerning your
identities?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agreed that his name will be GUILLERMO LITERAL who is my elder bro­ther
and that I am JOSE N. LITERAL.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did you change your identities?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because sir, when I was still in Sta. Ana, I
was arrested by MPD men because of my murder case in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place> where I used the name MANUEL HANASAN
and also I have a case in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> in which I am charged under my
true name ARMINGOL HANASAN.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agreed to
use the name LITERAL so that we will not be detected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because sir I have already posted my bail
bond in my case in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>
that is why I was released but I did not appear in court during the hearing of
the case and I know that there will be a war­rant for my arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:
Now, going back to this insurance, what hap­pened after your talk with BENJAMIN
VERI­NA, the underwriter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agreed that GUILLERMO will insure him­self
with the <span class="SpellE">PhilAmLife</span> for P10,000.00 for a Five year
Convertible Non-Participating insurance."</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tell us, why did you poison GUILLERMO?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the money sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I needed money badly and this was the reason
I convinced him to insure himself for P10,000.00 making my­self his
beneficiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the policy was
approved I waited for the right opportunity to poison him and <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1965</st1:date> was it sir."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously the appellant had nurtured, deliberated on, and persisted
in, his evil plan to kill the deceased - "for the money," to quote
his own words - from the time he broached the subject of life insurance to the
latter sometime in January 1965, until he finally poisoned him on March 25,
1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undeniably present here is that
period of time sufficient in a judicial sense to afford full opportunity for
meditation and reflection and long enough to allow the appellant's conscience
to overcome the determination of his will if he had desired to <span class="SpellE">harken</span> to its warnings.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Inescapable are the fact that the crime was spawned by cold-blooded scheming,
and the tenacious persistence of the appellant in moving forward to its
conclusion the accomplishment of the felony.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of abuse of confidence must likewise
be appreciated in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant befriended Guillermo Literal, and later enticed him to live in his
(appellant's) house and help in his buy and sell business as well as in the
house­hold chores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this apparently
charitable act of taking a jobless illiterate man into his household and
providing him with the neces­sities of life, the appellant must assuredly have
gained the confi­dence and trust of the deceased who clearly regarded him as
bene­factor and protector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was this
confidence which enabled the shrewd appellant to deceive the deceased into
signing his own death warrant - i.e., taking a life insurance policy for
P10,000 and mak­ing the appellant the primary beneficiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also this confi­dence which led the
unsuspecting victim to stand up and turn his back in order to comply with the
appellant's command to get drink­ing water, thus affording the appellant the
chance to pour the arse­nic solution on the deceased's meal of rice and '<span class="SpellE">paksiw</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">galung­gong</span>.’"
The victim's confidence and trust in the appellant facilita­ted the commission
of the crime, the latter taking advantage of the victim's belief that he would
not abuse the confidence reposed in him.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Viewing the record in its entirety, we see no reason to dis­turb
the lower court's finding that the appellant committed the crime of murder by
means of poison on the person of Guillermo Literal, attended by the aggravating
circumstances of evident pre­meditation and abuse of confidence, only one of
which is offset by the mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The civil indemnity awarded to the heirs of the deceased must be
increased to P12,000.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, with the modification that the indemnity to
be paid by the appellant to the heirs of Guillermo Literal is in­creased to
P12,000.00, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is affirmed, at appel­lant's cost.</p>
