				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner seeks a reversal of the order of the Court of First
Instance of Manila dismissing her petition for relief under Rule 38 of the
Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
proceedings in the courts below are:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 28, 1963, respondent judge of the City Court (formerly
Municipal Court) of Manila rendered judgment by default<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
against petitioner directing her, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
to vacate Stall No. 78 of the Manila <span class="SpellE">Cartimar</span> Market,
subject of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit; to pay P71.00 for
rentals in arrears and rentals at the rate of P2.70 a day from March 20, 1963
until the premises shall have been vacated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioner moved to set aside the default order, decision and the writ of
execution issued to enforce the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Want of jurisdiction over
her person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, so she avers,
summons and copy of the complaint were served upon her salesgirl, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Burce</span>, who did not turn
over said papers to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1963</st1:date>, respondent judge denied
the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1963</st1:date>, petitioner moved to reconsider and
sought new trial, reiterating the jurisdictional ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, she appended to the motion an
affidavit of her salesgirl, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Burce</span>, which recites that certain papers which she came to
know later as summons and complaint in said case were served upon her; that she
"was not able to give said papers" to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>
Cruz; that she closed the store in the last week of March, 1963 upon
instructions of petitioner; and that thereafter she went to <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>,
by reason of which she was unable to pay "the balance of the March
rental" with the P30 given her by petitioner for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6">June
 8, 1963</st1:date>, respondent judge again denied this motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioner went to the Court of First Instance for relief from the city court's
judgment of <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1963</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
She asked that the decision and writ of execution be set aside and that trial
on the merits be had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents'
answer to the petition - bearing date of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1963</st1:date> - presented solely issues of law,
principally (1) that the petition was time-barred; and (2) granting that the
petition was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,
the negligence of petitioner's salesgirl, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Burce</span>, is not excusable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's reply of <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1963</st1:date> reasoned out that her petition for relief was timely and
that the negligence of her salesgirl is one not "pertaining to peti­tioner
herself" and that the latter's "failure to answer the complaint and
air her side of the case before the respondent inferior court cannot be blamed
on her entirely and absolutely."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1964</st1:date>, re­spondent
corporation filed a motion to resolve its answer to the petition, upon the
averment that said answer partakes of a motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this motion, sent by registered mail,
was received by petitioner counsel on <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July 3, 1964,
the Court of First Instance issued an order, which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It appearing that the petitioner came
to know of the judgment from which relief is sought on May 22, 1963; that she
filed this petition only on August 1, 1963, or after a lapse of 71 days; and
that the period of 60 days from the time the petitioner learns of the judgment
within which she may file a petition for relief is never interrupted, as prayed
for, the petition is dismissed with costs against the petitioner."</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to reconsider was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And for a number of reasons.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner had notice of
the judgment of the city court at the latest on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
in her motion filed on that date - May 22, 1963 - to set aside the default
order, decision and writ of execution, she averred "[t]hat it was only a
few days ago that defendant came to know of the case filed against her and she
forthwith referred the matter to her undersigned counsel, who Immediately went
to court and looked for the record of the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
She filed the petition for relief on August 1 following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between May 22 and <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="8">August 1, 71</st1:date> days elapsed. Her petition for relief
is eleven (11) days late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because,
Section 3, Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court, requires, amongst others,
that a petition for relief be filed "within sixty (60) days after the
petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other proceeding to be set
aside."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her failure to comply with
this period peremptorily exacted by the rules warrants dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But petitioner argues
that the period consumed by the pro­ceedings in the city court should be
deducted from the 60-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is
how she explains her case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lodged
with the inferior court her motion to set aside the order of default, decision
and writ of execution on May 22.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent judge denied this motion on May 25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 4, she moved for reconsideration and
new trial - which was denied on June 8.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notice of this denial was received by her counsel on July 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between July 3 and August 1, when her
petition for relief before the Court of First Instance was filed - is only 29
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ergo</u>, the 60-day time-limit
has not expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's argument fails of its purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, a doctrine which gained foothold through
reiteration is that the 60-day period set forth in Rule 38 is absolutely fixed,
<span class="SpellE">inextendible</span>, never interrupted,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and cannot be subjected to any condition or contingency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the period fixed "is itself
devised to meet a condition or contingency"; the equitable remedy a Rule
38 ''is an act grace, as it were, designed to give the aggrieved party another
and last chance and a petitioner for relief being "in the position one who
begs, such party's privilege is not to impose conditions, haggle or
dilly-dally, but to grab what is offered him."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
So it is that neither the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of certiorari
proceeding before this Court, as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Palomares</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Jimenez</u>, <u>supra</u>, nor the filing of a motion to reconsider the
order, subject of the petition or relief after learning of it, is in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rafanan</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Rafanan</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, will toll the running of the limited period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner here is in a worse position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her motion to set asides the city court's default
order, decision (which has become final) and writ of execution, was filed in
the wrong court - the said inferior court which did not have jurisdiction to
grant relief from judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion
amounts to nothing; it is no petition for relief at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the time consumed in the
proceedings <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> did not suspend the running of
the 60-day period.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances here presented, the Court of First Instance
of Manila had no alternative but to dismiss the petition for relief.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The petition for relief from judgment in the Court of First
Instance suffers from another infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's affidavit and that of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Burce</span> attached thereto do not show that if the judgment of
the city court were overturned and a new trial ordered, probability exists that
a different conclusion will be reached.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this point, all that the affidavits could say is that the premises
were vacated in the last week of March, 1963; that petitioner gave <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Burce</span> money P30.00 - to
pay for the balance of the unpaid rental for that month; that <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> was not able to pay as she "went to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Albay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
after closing the store." Apart from the fact that the excuse for
nonpayment is puerile, there he other fact that the amount given was
short.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the judgment calls for the
payment of P71,00, rentals in arrears up to March 19, and <u>daily</u> rentals
of P2.70 from <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no denial of failure to pay <u>in
full</u> rentals previously due, and that the balance of unpaid rentals for the
month of March had not been paid, respondent corporation made a clear case for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any showing
of fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence which would authorize
relief under Rule 38, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Burce</span>
is of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her affidavit is to the
effect that she receive the summons and copy of the complaint; that she failed
to deliver them to petitioner, as she immediately proceed to <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> after she closed the store in the last week of March,
1963; and that since then, she has not communicated with petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citation of jurisprudential support is
unnecessary for the view that this affidavit does not show excusable
negligence.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner assails the
order of the Court of First Instance of July 3, 1964 dismissing her petition
for relief, as one issued without a hearing on the merits thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">That petition for relief recites the facts and the proceedings
had in the city court, explains the bearing of the facts on the legal
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' answer thereto
concedes the facts but says that petitioner is not entitled to relief as a
matter of law, Petitioner's reply to the answer rebuts the points of law
raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in this setting that on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1964</st1:date> respondents filed their
"Motion for Resolution of Answer Filed by Defendant Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Oppen</span>, Inc." This motion may not have been skillfully
labeled in effect, however, it is a motion for judgment on the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No question of facts is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may make a decision upon the legal
issues and <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>basis</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>pleadings</u>
and the reasons advanced by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applicable then is Section 1, Rule 19 of the Revised Rules of
Court (formerly Section 10, Rule 35 of the old Rules), which states that where
an answer "admits the material allegations of the adverse party's
pleading, the court may, <u>on</u> <u>motion</u> <u>of</u> <u>that</u> <u>party</u>
direct judgment on such pleading."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On this point, then Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> of the Court of Appeals now of this Court, analyzing
the provisions of Section 10, Rule 35 of the old Rules of Court, observed<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that "the rule does not state whether the motion for judgment on the
pleadings may be considered ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> or only upon
notice served on the adverse party," and concluded that a motion for
judgment on the pleadings in which all the material averments of the complaint
are admitted, "is one that may he considered ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
because, upon the particular fact thus presented and laid before the court, the
plaintiff is entitled to the precise order applied for."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the situation here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No need there to set for oral arguments<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
respondents' motion of June 8. </p>

<p class="NUM">6. Concededly, the order of <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="7">July
 3, 1984</st1:date> dismissing the petition was issued without hearing the
parties on oral arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
proceedings did not end there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
petitioner moved to reconsider that order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that motion for reconsideration, she has had the opportunity to
present, and in fact did present, her written arguments once again on the legal
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She set her aforesaid motion to
reconsider for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="8">August 15,
 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has had
opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cannot
complain. Unfortunately for her, it was denied on that same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this factual environment, it cannot be said that petitioner
was denied her day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of
original notice to set the motion to resolve for hearing was cured by the fact
that she was heard on her motion for re consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">She was not, therefore, prejudiced by the fact that respondents'
motion to decide the case was not set for hearing.</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At all events, if the
Court of First Instance erred in revolving respondent corporation's motion for
resolution of its answer wit out setting it f for hearing under the
circumstances here stated, it was harmless error;<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
it does not affect the substantial rights of petition; petitioner will not fare
any better if the case were to be return to the inferior court for a new trial;
the appealed orders need not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, the law does not require useless ceremony.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>
