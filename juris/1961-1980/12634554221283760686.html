				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">As a result of a
vehicular accident in which plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Caedo</span> and several members of his family were </span>injured
they filed this suit for <span class="GramE">recovery</span> of damages from the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment, rendered by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1960</st1:date> (Q-2952), contains
the following disposition:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the court renders a judgment, one
in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span>
Thai and Rafael Bernardo, jointly <span style="">and
severally, to pay to plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Caedo</span> et al., the sum of P1, <span class="GramE">929</span>.
70 for actual damages; P48, 000.00 for moral damages; P10, 000.00 for exemplary
damages; and P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for attorney's fees, with costs
against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The counterclaim of the defendants against
the plaintiffs is hereby or­dered dismissed, for lack of merits."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1960</st1:date>
the judgment was amended so as to include an additional award of P3, 705.11 in
favor of the plaintiffs for the damage sustained by their car in the ac­cident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both parties appealed to
the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to us in view of the total
amount of the plaintiffs’ claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are two principal questions posed for resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) who was responsible for the accident? <span class="GramE">and</span> (2) if it was defendant Rafael Bernardo, was his
employer, defendant Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span> Thai, <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liable with him? On the first question the trial court found Rafael Bernardo
negligent; and on the second, held his employer <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liable with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mishap occurred at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1958</st1:date>
on Highway 54 (now E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:street><st1:address>Santos
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>) in the vicinity of <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Lorenzo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> was driving
his Mercury car on his way from his home in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> to the airport, where
his son Ephraim was scheduled to take a plane for <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With them in the car were Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Caedo</span> and three
daughters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming from the opposite
direction was the Cadillac of Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span> Thai, with his
driver Rafael Bernardo at the wheel, taking the owner from his <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> home to <span class="SpellE">Wack</span> <span class="SpellE">Wack</span> for his regular round of golf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two cars were travel­ing at fairly
moderate speeds, considering the condition of the road and the absence of
traffic - the Mercury at 40 to 50 kilometers per hour, and the Cadillac at
approximately 30 to 35 miles (48 to 56 kilometers).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their headlights were mutually noticeable
from a distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ahead of the Cadillac,
going in the same direction, was a <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span>
owned by a certain Pedro Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span> was towing another horse by means of a
short rope coiled around the rig's ver­tical post on the right side and held at
the other end by Pedro's son, Julian Bautista.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rafael Bernardo testified that he was almost upon the rig when he
saw it in front of him, only eight meters away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the first clear indication of his negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span>
was provided with two lights, one on each side, and they should have given him
sufficient warning to take <span style="">the
necessary precautions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if he
did not notice the lights, as he claimed later on at the trial, the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span> should anyway have been visible to him
from afar if he had been careful, as it must have been in the beam of his head</span>lights
for a considerable while.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime the
Mercury was coming on its own lane from the opposite direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernardo, instead of slowing dawn or stopping
altogether behind the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span> until that
lane was clear, veered to the left in order to pass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he did so the curved end of his car’s
right rear bumper caught the forward rim of the rig</span><span style="">'s</span><span style=""> left wheel, wrench­ing it off and carrying
it along as the car skidded obliquely to the other lane, where it collided with
the oncoming vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On his part <span class="SpellE">Caedo</span> had seen the Cadillac on its own lane; he slackened
his speed, judged the distances in relation to the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span>
and concluded that the Cadillac would wait behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernardo, however, decided to take a gamble -
beat the Mercury to the point where it would be in line with the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span>, or else squeeze in between them in any
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a risky maneuver either
way, and the risk should have been quite ob­vious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, since the car was moving at from 30 to 35
miles per hour (or 25 miles according to </span><span style="">Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span> </span><span style="">Thai) it was al­ready too late to apply the
brakes when Bernardo saw the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span> only
eight meters in front of him, and so he had to swerve to the left in spite of
the presence of the oncoming car on the opposite lane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="">it was, the clearance Bernardo gave for his
car’s </span><span style="">right side was
insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its rear bumper, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">already stated, caught the wheel of the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span>
and wrenched it loose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caedo</span>, confronted with the unexpected situation, tried to
avoid the collision at the last moment by going farther to the right, but was
unsuccessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The photographs taken at
the scene show that the right wheels of his car were on the unpaved shoulder of
the road at the moment of impact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">no doubt at all that the collision was
directly traceable to Rafael Bernardo's negligence and </span>that he must be
held liable for the damages suffered by the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next question <span style="">is </span>whether or not Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span> Thai, as <span style="">owner
</span>of the Cadillac, <span style="">is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable </span>with the
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable law is Article
2184 of the Civil Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 2184.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In motor
vehicle mishaps, the owner <span style="">is </span><span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with his driver, if
the former, who was in the vehicle, could have, by the <span style="">use of due diligence, </span>pre­vented the
misfortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>disputably presumed that a driver
was negligent, if he has been found guilty of reckless driving or vio­lating
traffic regulations at least twice within the next preceding two months.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under
the foregoing provision, if the causative factor was the driver's negligence,
the owner </span><span style="">of the vehicle who was
present is likewise held liable if he could have prevented the mishap by the
exercise of due diligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule <span style="">is n</span>ot new, although formulated </span><span style="">as law </span><span style="">for the first <span style="">time in </span>the new Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was expressed in Chapman vs. Underwood (1914) 27 Phil. 374, where
this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The <span style="">same
</span>rule applies where the owner is present, unless the negligent acts of
the driver are continued for such a length of time as to give the owner a
reasonable op­portunity to observe them and to direct his driver to desist <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An owner
who sits in his automobile, or other vehicle, and permits his driver to
continue in a violation of the law by the performance of negligent acts, <span style="">after he has had a
reasonable opportunity to observe them and to direct that the driver cease <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, becomes himself responsible for such acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The
owner of an automobile who permits his chauffeur to drive up the <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, for example, at a speed of 60 miles an hour,
without any effort to stop him, although he has had a reasonable </span>opportunity
to do so, becomes himself responsible, both criminally and civil­ly, for the
results produced by the acts of the chauffeur.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, if the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and
without the owner having <span style="">a </span>reasonable
opportunity to <span style="">prevent the act or its
continuance, injures a person or <span style="">violates
the cri</span></span><span style="">minal law, the </span>owner
of the automobile, although present therein at the time the act was committed, <span style="">is not respon­sible, either civilly or
criminally, <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The act complained of must be continued in the presence of the owner
for such a length of time that the owner, by his acquiescence, makes his
driver's act his own."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The basis of the master<span style="">’</span><span style="">s</span> liability
in civil law is not <span class="SpellE"><u>respondeat</u></span><span style=""> <u>superior</u></span> but rather the
relationship of <span class="SpellE"><u>pater</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">familias</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory is that ultimately the negligence
of the servant, if known to the master and susceptible of timely correction by
him, reflects his own negligence if he fails to correct it in order to prevent
injury or damage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case the defendants' evidence <span style="">is </span>that Rafael Bernardo had been Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span> Thai's driver since 1937, and before that had been
employed by <span class="SpellE">Yutivo</span> Sons Hardware Co. in the same
capacity for over ten years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During <span style="">that time he had no
record of violation of traffic laws and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No negligence for having employed him at all
may be imputed to his master.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negligence
</span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the part of the
latter, if any, must be sought </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the immediate setting and circumstances of the
accident, that </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">in his failure to detain the driver from pursuing a course which not only
gave him clear notice of the danger but also sufficient time to act upon
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not see </span>that such
negligence may be imputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car, as
has been stated, was not running at an unreasonable speed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The road was wide and open, and devoid of
traffic that early morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
reason for the car owner to be in any special state of alert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had reason to rely on the skill and
experience of his driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He became aware </span>of
the presence of the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span> when his car was
only twelve meters behind it, but then his failure to see it earlier did not
constitute negligence, for he was not himself at the wheel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even when he did see it at that distance,
he could not have anticipated his driver's sudden decision to pass the <span class="SpellE"><u>carretela</u></span> on its left side in spite of the fact that
another car was approaching from the opposite direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time element was such that there was no
reasonable opportunity for Yu <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Khe</span></span><span style=""> </span>Thai to assess the risks involved and
warn the driver accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thought
that entered his mind, he said, was that if he sounded a sudden warning it
might only make the other man nervous and make the situation worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a thought that, wise or not, connotes
no absence of that due diligence required by law to prevent the misfortune.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The test of imputed
negligence under Article </span><span style="">2184 </span>of
the <span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Code is, </span>to a great degree,
necessarily subjective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Car owners are
not held to a uniform and inflexible standard of diligence <span style="">as are </span>professional drivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many cases they refrain from driving <span style="">their </span><span style="">own </span><span style="">cars and </span>instead
hire other persons to drive for them precisely because they are not trained or
endowed with sufficient discernment to know the rules of traffic or to
appreciate the <span style="">relative dangers </span>posed
by the different situations that are continually encountered on the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would be a negligent omission under the
aforesaid Article on the part <span style="">of a </span>car
owner who is in the prime of age and knows how to handle a motor vehicle is not
<span style="">necessarily so on the part, say, of an
old and infirm person who <span style="">is </span>not
similarly equipped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span style="">law does </span>not require that a <span style="">person must possess a certain measure </span>of
skill or proficiency either in the mechanics of driving or in the observance of
traffic rules before he may own a motor vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test of his negligence, within the
meaning of Article 2184, is his omission to do that which the evidence of his </span><span style="">own </span><span style="">senses tells him he should do in order to avoid the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as far <span style="">as </span>perception is concerned, absent </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">minimum </span><span style="">level imposed by
law, a maneuver that appears to be fraught with danger to one passenger may
appear to be entirely safe and commonplace to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were the law to require a uniform standard of
perceptiveness, employment of professional drivers by car owners who, by their
very inadequacies, have real need of drivers’ services, would be effectively
proscribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that the
imputation of liability to Yu <span class="SpellE">Khe</span> Thai, solidarity
with Rafael Bernardo, is an error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next question refers to the sums adjudged by the trial court as damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of P48, 000 by way of moral damages
is itemized as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
