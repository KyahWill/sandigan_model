				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on pure questions of law from the decision <span style="">of the Court of First Instance </span>of
Camarines Sur in its Civil Case No. 5673, dismissing the action instituted <span style="">by the petitioners as designated
beneficiaries in the life insurance policy of one Napoleon F. <span style="">Picar, a de­ceased government employee,
against the Government Ser­vice Insurance System, on the ground that due to the
</span>failure of the said petitioners to submit a certificate of clearance
from the money and property accountabili­ties of the deceased, they have no
cause of action a<span style="">gainst the defendant
GSIS.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
case was submitted </span><span style="">by all the
parties for de­cision in the court below upon the following Stipulation of
Facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Policy No. 170329 <span style="">issued in </span>favor of the late Napoleon
F. Picar, was, on September 13, 1961, in force;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Napoleon F. Picar died on September 13,
1961;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Consolacion J. Picar <span style="">is the guardian of all the minors who are the
plaintiffs herein;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
the beneficiaries in the insurance policy issued in favor of Napoleon F. Picar
are the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nancy Picar, Jesse
Picar, Sylvia Picar, Luz Picar and Consolacion Picar;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the administrator of the estate of the
late Napoleon F. Picar <span style="">is </span>the
Provincial Treasurer of <span style="">Cama­rines Sur;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
on September 30, 1961 a claim was presented to the G.S.I.S. for the proceeds of
the life insur­ance policy for relief or payment to the beneficiaries named
therein;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the G.S.I.S. is withhold­ing payment of
the proceeds of the life insurance policy only on the ground that no clearance
was issued to the deceased by the employer of the deceased, the Provincial Trea­surer
of Camarines Sur;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the Provincial Trea­surer filed a claim
for P9,746.07 to the intestate estate of the late Napoleon Picar;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the basis of the go­vernment
represented by the Pro­vincial Treasurer of Camrines Sur in intervening in this
case (Civil Case No. 5673) <span style="">is </span>Section 26 of Commonwealth Act 186,
as a­mended;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiffs are also withdrawing their
claim for moral damages <span style="">as </span>well as attor­ney's fees, but insist on the in­terest due
from September 30, 1961 <span style="">when the claim was made, up to the time the insurance policy is fully
paid;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That the plaintiffs secured the
services of <span style="">counsel
</span><span style="">to
claim </span><span style="">this
insurance </span>policy in the amount of P500.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of these stipulated facts, the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u></span>
on August 30, 1965, dismissed the aforesaid act­ion of the beneficiaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ruled thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The only issues to be decided in <span style="">this case are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(1) whether <span style="">it is leg</span>ally necessary for the
plaintiffs to present a clearance from money and property accountabilities of
the deceased to be <span style="">issued by the
authorities concerned, and required </span><span style="">by the </span><span style="">defendant, GSIS, before the </span><span style="">proceeds of the </span>Policy No. 170329 <span style="">is </span>paid to
the beneficiaries desig­nated therein; and (2) whether the Republic of the
Philippines, as re­presented by <span style="">the
Provincial Treasur</span><span style="">er of
Camarines Sur, can legally lay claim to the proceeds of the policy in question.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contract of insurance enter­ed into by the insured,
Napoleon F. Picar and the Government Service Insurance System is governed by
Com­monwealth Act No. 186, the law creat­ing the said insurance system and not
by Act 2427 as contended by the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Act 2427 governs the contract of insurance between Private
Insurance Companies and pri­vate persons Commonwealth Act No. 186 on the other
hand, governs the contract of insurance between the Government Service
Insurance System and employees of the Philippine Go­vernment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government Service Insurance System was
created by Com­monwealth Act 186 for the sole pur­pose and benefit <span style="">of </span>government em­ployees, so much so,
that nobody can be insured with the Government Service Insurance System except
when he is a government employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
General Circular No. 52 of the General Auditing Office dated December 23, 1957
is applicable to the insurance contract between the deceased Napoleon F. Picar
and the defendant, Government Service In­surance System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And due to the failure of the plaintiffs to
submit a certificate of clearance from the money and property accountabilities
of the deceased, Napoleon F. Picar, they have no cause of action against the
defendant, Government Service Insurance System.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the claim of the intervenor, Republic of the
Philippines represent­ed by the Provincial Treasurer of Camarines Sur, the
court is of the opi­nion and so holds, that it being the employer of the
deceased, Napoleon F. Picar, it has the right to the proceeds of said insurance
to satisfy the indebtedness of said deceased to the government, pursuant to the
provision of Section 26 of Commonwealth Act 186.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In view of all the
foregoing con</span>siderations, judgment is hereby rendered; <span style="">(a) </span>dismissing
the plaintiffs' complaint with costs against them; and (b) declaring that the
intervenor <span style="">is legally entitled to the
proceeds of the life insurance policy of the </span>defendant, Napoleon F.
Picar."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>from this holding of the court below that, as earlier stated
in the opening paragraph of this <span style="">decision,
</span>the present appeal has been taken to this Court by the designated
beneficiaries in the life insurance policy here involved, the widow and the
minor children of the late Napoleon F. Picar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said appellants here allege <span style="">that
the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) in holding
that the plain­tiffs-appellants have no cause of action against the de­</span><span style="">fendant-appellee
due to the </span><span style="">failure of the plaintiffs-</span><span style="">appellants to submit a certificate of clearance of
the </span><span style="">deceased Napoleon F. Picar;
and (b) <span style="">in holding </span>that the
Republic of the Philippines is the entity legally enti­tled to the proceeds of
the policy of the life of Napoleon F. Picar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants vigorously contend that the proceeds of the life
insurance policy here involved - upon <span style="">the
death </span>of the insured employee during the endowment period - belonged
exclusively to the beneficiaries designated in the policy and <u>not</u> to the
estate of the insured; that, therefore, the said deceased's employer - the
Provincial Treasurer of Camarines Sur or <span style="">the Republic </span>of the Philip­pines - cannot legally lay claim to the
proceeds of such life insurance, since it <span style="">is </span>not part of the estate of said deceased employee; and,
consequently, the appellee Government Service Insurance System acted without
legal authority when it made the presentation of a certificate of clearance
from money and property <span style="">accountabilities
of </span>the deceased to be secured from his employer <span style="">as a </span>condi­tion precedent to the
payment of the proceeds of the life insurance in question to the appellants who
are the designated beneficiaries in the policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contention <span style="">is </span>untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is</span> true that
under general principles in the law of insurance, if a policy provides that the
proceeds shall be payable to the assured, if he lives to a cer­tain date, and,
in case of his death before that date, then they shall be payable to the
beneficiary designated, the benefit of the policy will inure to such
beneficiary <span style="">in case the assured dies
before the end of the period de­signated in the policy,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and, generally, that </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">proceeds of a life insurance in which a third
person </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">named beneficiary belong
exclusively to such beneficiary as an individual, they are not the property of
the heirs of the insured, are not subject to administration, and cannot
properly be claimed or received by the administrator or other legal
representative of the insured as assets of his estate</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As correctly ruled by the lower court,
however, such general principles are not applicable </span><span style="">to th</span><span style="">e life insurance herein involved which is governed by specific law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The law in point is
Section 26 of Commonwealth Act 186 (the law creating the (Government Service
insurance System), as amended, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Sec.
</span>26.- Exemption from legal <span style="">process
and liens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No policy of life insurance
issued under this Act, or the proceeds thereof, when paid to any member
thereunder, nor any other benefit granted under this Act, shall be liable to
attach­ment, garnishment, or other process, or to be</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">seized,
taken, appropriated, or applied by any legal or equitable process or operation
of law to pay any debt or liability of such member, or his beneficiary, or any
other person who may have</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a right there</span><span style="">under,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">either before or after
pay</span><span style="">ment
nor shall the proceeds there</span><span style="">of,
when not made payable to a named beneficiary, constitute </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">part of the estate of the member for pay­ment
of his debt:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That
this section shall not apply when obligations or indebtedness to the System and
the employer ate con­cerned; nor when the retirement an­nuity </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">assigned to any person, corporation,
association or bank or other financial institution, which is hereby
authorized."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provision is too clear to require the
application of any rule of statutory construction for purposes of showing the
weakness of the position ta­ken by herein appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As may be seen, it recognizes the principles
relied upon by them, but at the same time, it expressly provides that
"this section shall not apply when obligations or indebtedness to the
System and the employer are concerned".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, in life insur­ance policies issued by the GSIS in favor
of government employees, the proceeds - even if not made payable to named
beneficiaries and may, therefore, be payable to the estate of the insured -
shall not constitute part of the estate of the member (insured) for payment of
his debt; but such proceeds - whether or not made payable to named
beneficiaries - shall so constitute part of the estate of the insured for payment
of his debt and shall thereby be liable to attachment, garnishment and other
legal processes, when obligations or indebtedness to the GSIS and the employer,
that is, the government are con­cerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no doubt then that the appellee Government Service
Insurance System was right in re­quiring herein appellants to submit the
necessary clearance from money and property accountabilities of the de­ceased
government employee whose insurance policy is here involved, before paying them
the proceeds of the policy concerned; and the lower court did not err in <span style="">holding that the appellants, for their
failure to submit the certificate of clearance required of them, have no cause
of action against the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
since it is not disputed by appellants that the Republic of the Philippines,
employer of the deceased employee in this cases is claiming the proceeds of his
insurance on the basis of the provisions of the law above-quoted, We agree with
the appellee GSIS that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> was right in declaring
that the intervenor Republic of the Philippines is legally entitled to the
proceeds of the life insurance here put to question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the decision appealed from is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On equitable considerations,
no pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
