an application for a certificate of public convenience to operate a PUB service
on the <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac-Cubao</span>,

both termini.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> filed an amended application altering the line
applied for from <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac-Cubao</span>,

the proposed number of units and schedule of trips.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission set the amended application for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> filed a

with the same number of units and under the same time schedule originally
proposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission set the second
amended application for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine
Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Philippine Rabbit), on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1964</st1:date>, and the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Trans­portation Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred

on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1964</st1:date>, filed their
respective written op­positions to the second amended application.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> moved for the postponement of the scheduled
hearing which the Commission granted and re­set for <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> asked for another postponement of the
scheduled hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission granted
the same and re-set the hearing for <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> merely presented proof
of publication and service of the pleadings to the affected operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span>
asked for a fur­ther postponement of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed to a continuance of the
hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1964</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> presented its witness, Marcelo David of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
who testified on the alleged public need for additional bus service on the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City-Manila run.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the witness' direct testimony, the Commission, due to lack of
material time, and upon agreement of the parties, adjourned the proceedings,
and re-scheduled the hearing for December 10 and 11, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1964</st1:date>, however, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> moved for the
cancellation of the hearing scheduled for December 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission, acting upon the motion,
re-set the case for further proceedings on December 11, 1964, as previously
sche­duled, and on January 5 and 6, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on December 11, the Commission suggested that, for
the benefit of the parties, a "check" be conducted by its inspectors
for a period of thirty days at a point along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Kennon</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> in order to
determine the volume of passenger traffic on the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City-<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Monument line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties accepted the suggestion, and the
inspectors of the Commission conducted an actual check covering the period from
<st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1964</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending the completion and submission of the
ins­pectors' report, the parties agreed to the suspension of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> filed with the Commission an application for
a provisional permit to operate a PUB service "between <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Monument</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and intermediate points and vice-versa."</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 27, 1965, the Commission promulgated Order No. 2, Series
of 1965, imposing a moratorium on the grant of new certificates of public
convenience either for new or additional PUB or PUJ services along the national
highway in northern, central and southern Luzon because of the numerous
transportation units already authorized on the lines therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span>
filed a supplemental application for a provisional permit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission, thereafter, re-set the main application for
hearing on July 12 and 16, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1965</st1:date>,
Philippine Rabbit filed with the Commission a motion for the suspension of the
proceedings re <span class="SpellE">Pambusco's</span> parent application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Rabbit invoked as ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> that <span class="SpellE">Pambusco's</span>
application fell within the scope of Memorandum Order No. 2, Series of 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="7">July
 12, 1965</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, Philippine
Rabbit, <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span>,
learned that <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> filed with the Commission an
application and supplemental application for a provisional permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having been furnished copies of the same,
the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> made a manifestation that no action <span class="GramE">be</span> taken on the application until copies thereof shall have
been furnished them and opportunity granted to them to oppose the said
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same hearing,
counsel for Philippine Rabbit cross-examined <span class="SpellE">Pambusco's</span>
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of material time, the
Commission postponed the cross-examination of the witness by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> to <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="7">July 16,
 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same hearing, the Commission suggested that another
"check" of the volume of passenger traffic on the proposed line be
conducted for another period of thirty days but at a different point along the
route.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the inspectors of
the Commission conducted the check at a point at Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, the parties
agreed to hold the hearing in abeyance until after the submission of the results
of the second check scheduled for the month of August.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Barely a few days after the completion of the check conducted at
Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, <span class="GramE">the</span>
Commission issued an order granting <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> a
provisional permit to operate a PUB service not on the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City-<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Monument run but on the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City-San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
received copies of the order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="9">September
 3, 1965</st1:date> on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="9">September 23,
 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1965</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> filed the instant <span style="">petition for <i>certiorari</i>, alleging
abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission in issuing the order granting
to <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> the provisional permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, in
their petition, also asked for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction
to res­train <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> from carrying out in any manner
the order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="9"><span style="">September 3, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, which this Court granted in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="10"><span style="">October
 7, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1966, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> filed with
the Commission an application to amend its certificate of public convenience so
as to extend its <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City-San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> line to include the <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pampanga-Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Rabbit, <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> opposed the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, after proceedings duly
had on the application, the Commis­sion rendered its decision, dated <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1969</st1:date>, authorizing <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> to operate ten (10) auto-trucks on the <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City-<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City route.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1969</st1:date>,
Philippine Rabbit filed with the Commission a motion for reconsideration of its
decision of <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="10">Octo­ber 30, 1969</st1:date>,
which motion was however subsequently withdrawn on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 4, 1970, this Court, in a resolution dated December
3, 1970, required the petitioners and the respondent to show cause why the
questions raised by the petition at bar should not be considered moot and
academic, it appearing that <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> at present
operates a PUB service on the <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Que­zon</span> City-<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City line,
thereby frustrating the ultimate re­lief sought by the petitioners in filing
the present petition - to restrain <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> from
operating passenger and freight service from metropolitan Manila to <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the petitioners, only Philippine Rabbit complied with this
Court's resolution by filing its manifestation opposing the dismissal of the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Rabbit expresses
the fear that should the petition be dismissed, said dismissal would "in
effect, revive the provisional authority" granted to <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span>
to operate fourteen (14) auto-trucks on the San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga-Baguio</span>
City line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would, according to
Philippine Rabbit, gravely prejudice its interest and rights because aside from
being allowed to operate ten (10) units on the <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City-<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City
line under the authority granted in the Commission's decision of October 30,
1969, <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> would further be authorized to operate
another fourteen units on the San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga-Baguio</span>
City route.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Any correction of the
errors allegedly committed by the </span>Commission in issuing the order
complained of granting to <span class="SpellE">Pam­busco</span> provisional
authority to operate on the <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pampanga-Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> line, would have no practical
value and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any judgment - either
in favor of the petitioners and against the respondent or in favor of the
respondent and against the petitioners - would not result in any material
advantage to either of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
considerations render any decision resolving the questions framed for
resolution by this Court un­necessary and purposeless.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Rabbit overlooks
the fact that the Commission laid down certain conditions in the order
complained of dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1965</st1:date>
granting to <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> the provisional permit applied
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these conditions is that</p>

<blockquote>"6. The
provisional permit herein granted may be modified or revoked by the Commission
at any time, shall be subject to whatever action that may be taken on the basic
application, and <u>shall be valid only for a period of SIX (6) </u><u><span style="">M</span>ONTHS from date hereto</u>." (<span class="GramE">emphasis</span> supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">Philippine Rabbit, therefore, need not
fear that the dismissal of the petition at bar would revive and render
effective the provi­sional permit for the same has, by the mere lapse of time,
expired and ceased to be valid.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Rabbit also loses
sight of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> at present operates a
PUB service on the <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>City-<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
line by virtue of the Commission's decision dated <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1969</st1:date>, amending <span class="SpellE">Pambusco's</span>
certificate of public convenience extending its <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City-San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
line to include the <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pampanga-Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easily perceivable that this
defeats the very purpose for which the petitioners sought to enjoin <span class="SpellE">Pambusco</span> from complying with the order granting the latter
the provisional permit to operate on the <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pampanga-Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> line - the same line involved<span style=""> </span>and referred <span style="">to in the Commission's </span>decision of <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of these considerations,
this Court sees no need to articulate an extended opinion on the </span>merits
of <span style="">the petition at bar for the same
would have no practical significance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the petition is hereby </span>dismissed<span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncements as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
