<p class="BODY">The lower Court accepted the version of the prosecu­tion, gave no
credence to the evidence of the defense, and rendered a decision finding
accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> guilty as charged, but
acquitting accused <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads as fol­lows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused Ernesto
<span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>, guilty as principal beyond reasonable doubt of
the crime of murder, as charged in the informa­tion, and there being no
aggravating nor mitigating circumstances present in the com­mission of the
crime, said accused is here­by sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA, medium of the
penalty for the crime of murder pe­nalized by Article 248 of the Revised Penal
Code, and to indemnify the heirs of the vic­tim (<span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>) in the sum of SIX THOUSAND (P6,000.00)
PESOS, without subsid­iary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay
one-fourth (1/4) of the costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gun used in the commission of crime is
hereby ordered confiscated in favor of the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the accused <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bailon</span>, the prosecution failed to prove beyond
reasonable doubt of his participation in the commission of the crime, and is
therefore ordered acquitted, with one-fourth (1/4) of the costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> now comes to
this Court on appeal from the above-mentioned decision of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant claims that the lower court
erred:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When it convicted accused-appellant Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>.</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->In not acquitting the accused-appellant.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned by the appellant boil down to the question of
whether or not the lower court had correctly found the appellant guilty of the
crime of murder of which he is charged.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In discussing the first error assigned, the ap­pellant contends
that his identity as the perpetrator of the crime has not been established
beyond reasonable doubt, since his conviction is mainly based on the uncor­roborated
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span>,
and the testi­monies of <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> who declared
that after he was shot, when he was brought to his house badly wounded and
bleeding, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>
told them that Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> shot him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant challenges the veracity of the testimonies of these
witnesses, claiming that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) their
testimonies are full of contradictions and flaws; (2) it took <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> several months
to come out and testify for the prosecution; and (3) the witnesses for the
prosecution are biased because <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Villegas and
Domingo Villegas are wife and father-in-law, respectively, of the deceased; and
<span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> and the
deceased belonged to the same religious sect, the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span>
<span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the well-settled rule in this jurisdiction that where the
issue to be resolved involves a question regarding the credibility of
witnesses, the appellate court generally does not disturb the findings of fact
of the trial court -- the trial judge being in a much better posi­tion to
decide the matter, having seen and heard the wit­nesses testify, and had
observed their demeanor and their manner of testifying during the trial - - unless
there is a showing that the trial court had overlooked certain facts of
substance and weight that, if considered, might affect the result of the case<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>.
Where there is an irreconcilable conflict in the testimonies of witnesses for
the prosecution and for the defense, as in the instant case, the appellate
court will not disturb the findings of fact of the trial court when the
evidence of the prevailing party is adequate to sustain the judgment appealed
from.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have made a thorough and careful study of the record of this
case, and We find no cogent reason to disturb the factual findings and
conclusions of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inconsistencies and discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses for the
prosecution, pointed out by the appellants, are not of the nature as would
warrant the reversal of the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Minor inconsis­tencies in the testimonies of
witnesses are, more often than not, indicative of the good faith and
truthfulness of witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant would discredit the testimonies of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> because it took
them two months after the day when the incident took place to come out and give
their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
unusual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As observed by this Court in
People v. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
"(T)he initial reluctance of witnesses in this country to volunteer
information about a criminal case, and their unwillingness to be involved in or
dragged into a criminal investigation, is common, and has been judicially
declared not to affect credibility."</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the relationship of the witnesses to the victim, We
are of the view that it does not render the clear and positive testimonies of
said witnesses less worthy of full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The declarations of interested witnesses are not necessarily biased and incre­dible.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also contended by appellant that the <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u>
statements given by the deceased were unreliable and the trial court erred in
giving credence to testimonies regard­ing those statements of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Conejos, a police sergeant, testified that when <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> was at the clinic of Dr. Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Aliño</span> in the eve­ning of March 7, 1965, he took down in
writing the declaration of <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> (Exhibit C), hearing the sound of the words he
uttered, which were not clear then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conejos stated that when he investigated <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>
the latter was so weak and he died a few minutes after he asked him some
questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conejos further declared that
one of the questions he asked <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> was "who
shot you?", and he (Conejos) could hear the weak voice of <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> which sounded the words "<span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have noted, however, that the trial court did not rely on the
testimony of Sgt. Conejos regarding the statements made by <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>
before he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court relied
more on the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Apolinar­io</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"However, from the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span>
Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>,
it appears that on the afternoon of March 7, 1965, at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabanaybanay</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Calabad</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
immediately after the incident, they saw the body of <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> full of blood and they asked what happened
to him, and he answered that he was shot by Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span>
Villegas is a part of <span class="SpellE"><u>Res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Gestae</u></span>
pursuant to Section 36, Rule 130, Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though these witnesses are not eye-witnesses
to the commission of the crime, yet their testimony corroborates the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span> that
he saw the accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> with a long
rifle, Cal. 22 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) on the afternoon of March 7,

barrio <span class="SpellE">Cala­bad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are of the view that the trial court has correct­ly considered
the statements made by the deceased <span class="SpellE">Gunda­yao</span> to <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>, because those statements were given
immediately after he was shot and the statements appear to be spontaneously and
naturally given.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The defense of appellant is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant tried to prove that he was in
the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>
from one o'clock to five o'clock in the afternoon of March 7, 1965, left the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> at five o'clock and was at barrio <span class="SpellE">Calabad</span> at about seven o'clock in the evening; and that
from barrio <span class="SpellE">Calabad</span> to <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mabanaybanay</span> it is about one hour walking
distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant, there­fore,
asserts that he could not be at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabanay­banay</span> between five and six o'clock in the afternoon
when the shooting incident, of which <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> was the victim, took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that the defense of alibi, to be suc­cessful, must
be proved by clear, positive, and satis­factory evidence, and unless this
requirement is met alibi cannot prevail over the clear, and positive iden­tification
of the accused by the witnesses for the pro­secution.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon an examination of the record, We agree with the following findings and
observations of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"The defense of alibi presented by accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> is of no credit and could not prevail over the
positive tes­timony of <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span>
who was an eyewitness to the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Rafanan</span>,
et al. G.R. L-13289, Sept. 29, 1962; People vs. Enrique <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
y de la Rosa, CA-G.R. No. 03595-CR, Feb. 15, 1965; O.G. Vol. 62 No. 26, P.
4604, June 27, 1966.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine in the cases above-cited says:</p>

<p class="2Q">'The rule is well settled that alibi cannot prevail over the posi­tive
testimony of a witness or wit­nesses identifying the accused as the author of
the offenses charged, es­pecially where no motive is shown for such witness or
witnesses to falsely testify against him.'</p>

<blockquote>"In the present case the defense did not establish a valid
motive why the witnes­ses for the prosecution falsely testified against accused
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>, who even tes­tified that he had no
quarrel with <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Villegas, the widow of the
victim, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony of defense witnesses <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Adigue</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> Dao,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> which try to establish that the accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> were in the cockpit in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> from
1:00 to 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon of March 7, 1965, and the testimony of Mrs.
Julia Manuel, a defense witness in this case, which tends to show that the said
accused were in her restaurant eating from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. are of no
credit for the reason that it contradict each other."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court made a categorical finding regarding the identity
of the appellant, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Cali­motan</span>, an eyewitness in the commission of the crime,
it shows that after hearing two gunshot reports, he saw accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> pointing a long rifle, Cal. 22 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A) at <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>, and
shot the latter while running away, being chased by accused <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> and another man whom he could not recognize,
but both of them were without arm, at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabanaybanay</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Calabad</span>,
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Mas­bate</span>, on the afternoon of March 7, 1965; and after
hearing other four gunshot reports, he saw accused Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>
still holding the rifle, and he was the only one who shot <span class="SpellE">Nemes­io</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even if the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span> is not corroborated by the testimony of another
eyewitness, the same was given full faith and credit by the trial judge, and
that testimony can serve as a sufficient basis for a finding of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, however, has pointed out
that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimotan</span>
was corrobo­rated by <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span> who tes­tified
that <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> soon
after the shooting in­cident told them that it was Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span>
who shot him.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. In the third error assigned, the appellant con­tends that under
the facts and circumstances exposed by the evidence of the prosecution, the
crime committed is homicide and not murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not find merit in this contention of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence is clear that <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> died of several gunshot wounds, and that four
wounds of entrance were found at the back of said deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Beotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Cali­motan</span> testified that <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> was running, being chased by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> and a companion,
and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Kipte</span> fired at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that appellant shot <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gundayao</span> at the back as
he was running away from him under a circumstance that entailed no risk to his
own life -- the victim being completely helpless and had no means of defending
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the victim died
as a result of four shots that hit him at the back as he was running away from
his aggressor constitutes an attendant circumstance of treachery or <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>, which qualifies the killing as that of
murder and not that of simple homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the Trial Court did not err in finding the appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No modifying circumstances having attended
the perpetration of the criminal act, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> correctly
imposed the prescribed penalty in its medium period, that is, <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the indemnity of P6,000.00 which the lower court ordered the appellant
to pay to the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gun­dayao</span> should be increased to P12,000.00 in accordance
with the ruling of this Court in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification of the amount to be paid
by the appellant as indemnity, the decision appealed from is affirmed in all
other respects, with costs.</p>
