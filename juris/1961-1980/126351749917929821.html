				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>
was filed by <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span>,
<span style="">plaintiff in Civil Case No. 1298 of the
Court of First Instance of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> against <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
Z. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mostajo</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">Francisca A. <span class="SpellE">Mostajo</span>, </span>Hector V. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Donato</span></span><span style=""> and the Immaculate <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That action was for partition of a </span>parcel
of land, referred <span style="">to in the record
merely as Lot No.</span><span style="">147-B, </span><span style="">portions of </span>which had been sold by the
owner, <span style="">petitioner's </span><span style="">father, to the </span>petitioner <span style="">himself and to the aforesaid defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time </span>another action
was f<span style="">iled by </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Felicisimo</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Mostajo</span> against
the </span>seller to compel <span style="">delivery of
</span><span style="">the portion sold to </span><span style="">him, </span><span style="">with an area of 35,</span><span style="">000
square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">That action was docketed as Civil Case No.
1276.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases were tried and decided jointly by the Honorable
Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>, now one of the respondents
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the decision the older <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span>, seller, was ordered to deliver to <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mostajo</span> 11,000 square
meters in addition to the 24,000 square meters alleged to pertain to him in the
complaint for partition, evidently to complete the 35,000 square meters claimed
by him in his own complaint against <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record is not clear as to these facts,
but it seems that the totality of the areas of the portions sold exceeded the
actual area of the entire parcel, and so in its decision the Court ordered that
the additional 11,000 square meters to be given to <span class="SpellE">Mostajo</span>
should be taken from the portions which had been sold to "<span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span> and/or Hector V. <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision was dated <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="7">July
 <span style="">8, </span>1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Donato</span> prayed for
and was given an extension of time - up to <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1965</st1:date> - within which to file a motion for recon­sideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He actually filed the motion on <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was denied and he filed a second
motion on August 13, which was granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court reconsidered and amended its previous decision on August 30,
1965, ordering <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span> the elder, defendant in Civil
Case No. 1276, to comply with the deed of sale he had executed in favor of
therein plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mostajo</span>
by delivering to the latter an addi­tional area of 11,000 square meters, to be
taken from the portion which <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span> had sold to his
son <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span>; and declaring Hector V. <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> the absolute owner of the portion which had been
sold to him, identified as lot No. 147-B-4, without any reduction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span> filed a record on appeal from the first decision,
together with an appeal bond; and the same was approved by the Court, in the
absence of any opposition, on <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August
 13, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the same
day <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> filed his second motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was
granted, as already noted, on August 30, and the next day, August 31, the Court
<span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
issued an order directing <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span>
to amend his record on appeal so as to incorporate therein the order reconsidering
the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span>
balked at the order to amend the record on appeal, contending that it was
beyond the power of the Court to issue once his appeal had been perfected by
the approval of the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
overruled the contention and on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1965</st1:date> set aside his order of <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1965</st1:date> approving the said record on appeal and
directed <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span> to
amend the same by in <span class="SpellE">corporating</span> therein the
pleadings filed and orders is­sued since its approval.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Simsim</span>
thereafter came to this Court on the present petition, challenging the last
mentioned order as having been issued without or in excess of jurisdiction, or
with grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This petition is palpably
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The peti­tioner relies on
Section 9 of Rule 41, which says that "the appeal is deemed perfected upon
the approval of the record on appeal and of the appeal bond... and thereafter
the trial court loses </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">jurisdiction over the case..." This rule
must be construed and applied reasonably and conjointly with other pertinent
rules so as to avoid im­practical and absurd situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of Rule 37 provides that within the
period of perfecting an appeal an aggrieved party may move the Court to set
aside the judgment and grant a new trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a motion, of course, may in effect be merely motion for
reconsideration if the ground alleged is that the evidence already of record is
insufficient to justify the decision or that the decision is against the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second motion for
reconsideration filed by Hector <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> was filed on
time, and the order amending the decision on the basis thereof was issued while
the case was still within the court's jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow the appeal as it was allegedly
perfected by the petitioner would be to place before the appellate court for
review a decision which had already been set aside and which, even in case of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>, would not be susceptible of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, such a view would place it
within the power of one of the parties, by the simple expedient of immediately
perfecting his appeal, to</span> <span style="">deprive
the other party of the right to ask for a reconsideration of the deci­sion, let
alone to have the court approve his own appeal if such a motion is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These consequences find no justification in the
Rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The proper procedure for the trial court to have taken in this
case was to defer approval the herein petitioner's appeal until the other
party's motion for reconsideration had been finally resolved; but its in­advertently
premature action in the premises was not beyond recall, and its order to have
the record on appeal amended <span style="">so </span>as
to <span style="">incorporate therein </span>its <span style="">real decision </span>in the <span style="">case was entirely within its power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is therefore dismissed, and the writ prayed
for denied, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
