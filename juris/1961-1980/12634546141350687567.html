				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from the decision of <span style="">the Juvenile and Domestic Relations </span>Court,
in Special Proceed­ing No. 0001, <span style="">dismissing
the </span>petition instituted by the spouse <span style="">Luis </span>R. Santos, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Edipola</span> V.
Santos for the adoption of the minor Edwin Villa y Mendoza.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is, whether or not
an <span style="">elder
sister </span>may adopt a younger brother.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court dismissed
the petition reasoning thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"A </span>critical
consideration in this case is the fact that the parents of the minor to be
adopted are also the parents of the petitioner-wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minor, therefore, is the latter's
legitimate brother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this proceeding, the adoption will result in an
incongruous situation where the minor Edwin<span style=""> </span>Villa, a legitimate brother of the <span style="">petitioner-wife, will also </span>be her son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the opinion of the court, that
incongruity, not neutralized by other circumstances absent herein, should
prevent the adoption."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners moved to
reconsider the decision but the decision was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts are not
disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span style="">above-named spouses </span><span style="">filed the petition be­fore the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January 8, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, praying that the minor Edwin Villa </span><span style="">y </span><span style="">Mendoza, 4 years old, be declared their
(petitioner’s) son by adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence
was presented that the order setting the case for hearing has been duly
published, Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There having been
no opposition registered to the petition, the petitioners were permitted to
adduce their evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was established that
the petitioners are both 32 years of age, Filipinos, residing in the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were married in 1957 and have maintained a conjugal home of their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not have a child of their own
blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither spouse has any
legitimate, legitimated, illegitimate, acknowledged natural <span class="GramE">child,</span>
or natural child by legal fiction; now has any one of them been convicted of a
crime involving moral turpitude. Edwin Villa y Mendoza, 4 years </span><span style="">old, </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">child of Francisco Villa and <span class="SpellE">Florencia</span> </span><span style="">Mendoza
who are the common parents of the petitioner-wife <span class="SpellE">Edipola</span>
Villa Santos and the minor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis E. San­tos,
Jr., is a lawyer, with-b</span><span style="">usiness </span><span style="">interest
in </span><span style="">a </span>textile
development enterprise and the IBA electric plant, and is the general manager
of <span class="SpellE">Medry</span>, Inc. and the secretary-treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Bearen</span> Enterprises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His income is approximately P600.00 a month. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>His co-petitioner-<span class="GramE">wife,</span>
is a nurse by profession, with an average monthly earning of about P300.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also shown that Edwin Villa <span style="">y </span>Mendoza was born on <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="5">May
 22, 1958</st1:date>, Exhibit C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
a sickly child since birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the
child's im­pairing health, his parents entrusted him to the petitioners who
reared and brought him up for the years thereafter, and as a result, there
developed between the petitioners and the child, a deep Hand profound love for
each <span style="">other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The natural parents of the minor testified
that they have voluntarily given their consent to the adoption of their son by
the petitioners, and submitted their written con­sent and conformity to the
adoption, and that they fully understand the legal consequences of the a­doption
of their child by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not aware of any provision in the law, and none has been
pointed to <span class="GramE">Us</span> <span style="">by
</span>the Solicitor General who argues for the State in this case, that
relatives by blood or<span style=""> </span>by
affinity, are prohibited from adopting one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only objection raised is the alleged
"incongruity" that will result, in the relation of the
petitioner-wife and the adopted, in the circumstance that the adopted who is
the legitimate brother of the adopter, will also be her son by adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory <span style="">is, </span>therefore,
advanced that adoption among people who are related by nature should not be
allowed, in order that dual re­lationship should not result, reliance being
made upon the views expressed by this Court in McGee vs. Republic, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-5387, </span><st1:date year="1954" day="29" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 29, 1954</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 94 Phil. 820.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In that case, an American citizen, Clyde E. McGee, married to a
Filipina by whom, he <span class="GramE">had</span> one child, instituted <span style="">a </span>proceeding for the adoption of two
minor children of the wife had by her first husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court granted the petition of McGee
to adopt his two minor step-children. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE"><span style="">On</span></span><span style=""> </span>appeal by the State, We reversed the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We said:</p>

<blockquote>"The purpose of adoption is to establish a relationship of
pater­nity a<span style="">nd <span class="SpellE"><span style="">filiation</span></span><span style=""> where none </span></span>existed
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where therefore the relationship
of parent and child already exists whether by blood or by affinity as in the
case of illegitimate and step­children, it would be unnecessary and superfluous
to establish and superimpose another relationship of parent and child through
adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, an express authorization
of law like article 338 is necessary, if not to render it proper and legal, at
least, to remove any and all doubt on the subject mat­ter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this view, article 338 may not be
regarded as a <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That may have been the reason why in the old
Code of Civil Procedure, particularly its provisions regarding adopt­ion,
authority to adopt a step­child by a step-father was pro­vided in section 766
notwithstand­ing the general authorization in section 765 extended to any inha­bitant
of the Philippines to adopt a minor child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same argument of <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> could
plausibly have been advanced as regards section 766, that is to say, section
766 was unnecessary and superfluous because without it a step-father could
adopt a minor step-child any­way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the inserting of section 766 was not entirely with­out
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems to be an established
principle in American jurisprudence that a person may not adopt his own
relative, the reason being that it is unnecessary to establish a relationship where
such already exists (the same philosophy underlying our <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
provisions on adoption).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So some states
have spe­cial laws authorizing the adoption of relatives such as a grandfather
adopting a grandchild and a father adopting his illegitimate or natural
child."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the views thus expressed, a study of American
precedents would reveal that there is a variance in the decisions of the courts
in different jurisdictions regarding the matter of adoption of rela­tives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be stated as a general proposition
that the adoption of a blood relative is contrary to <span style="">the </span>policy of the law, for in many states of the Union, no
restriction of that sort is contained in the statute authorizing adoption,
although laws of other <span style="">jurisdict­ions </span>expressly
provide that adoption may not take <span style="">placed
</span>within persons within a certain degree of relationship <span style="">(1 Am. </span><span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
628-629).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts in some status hold
that in the absence of express statutory restriction, a blood relationship
between the parties is not <span style="">a </span>legal impediment to the adoption of one by the other, and
there may be a valid adoption where the relation of parent and child already <span style="">exists </span>by
nature (2 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 2d <span style="">869).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Principles vary
according to the particular adoption statute of a state under which any given
case is considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem that <span style="">in </span>those
states ori­ginally influenced by the civil law countries where adoption
originated, the rules are liberally construed, while in other states where
common law principles pre­dominate, adoption laws are more strictly applied be­cause
they are to be in derogation of the common law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 335 of the <span style="">Civil </span>Code
enumerates those persons who may not adopt, and it has been shown that
petitioners-appellants herein are not among those pro­hibited from
adopting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 339 of the same code
names those who cannot be adopted, and the minor child whose adoption is under
consideration, is not ones of <span style="">those excluded </span>by the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 338, on the other hand, allows the
adoption of a natural child by the natural father or mother, of other
illegitimate child­ren by <span style="">their </span>father or <span class="GramE">mother,</span> and of a
step-child by the step-father or step-mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This last article is, of coarse, necessary to remove all doubts that <span style="">adoption </span>is not prohibited even in
these cases where there al­<span style="">ready </span>exist
<span style="">a </span>relationship
of parent and child between them by nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To say that adoption should not be allowed when the adopter and the
adopted are related to each other, except in these cases enumerated in Article
338, is to preclude adoption among relatives no matter how far removed or in
whatever degree that relationship might be, which in our opinion is not the
policy of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interest and welfare
of the child to be adopted should be of paramount considera­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adoption statutes, being humane <span style="">and </span>salutary, and designed to provide
homes, care and education for unfortunate <span class="GramE">children,</span>
should be construed so as to encourage the adoption of such children by person
who can properly rear and educate them (In re <span class="SpellE">Havsgord's</span>
Estate, 34 S.D. 131, 147 N.W. 378).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the </span>objection
that the adoption in this particular case will <span style="">result in a dual rela­</span>tionship between the <span style="">parties, </span>that the adopted brother <span style="">will also be the son of the </span>adopting
elder sister, <span style="">that fact alone should
not prevent the adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One </span>is
by nature, while the other is by fiction of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
relationship established by the adoption is limited </span>to the adopting <span style="">parents and does not extend to their other
relatives, except as expressly provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Thus, <span style="">the adopted child
cannot be considered as a rela­tive of the ascendants and collaterals of the
adopting </span>parents, nor of the <span style="">legitimate
children which they may have after the adoption except that the law imposes
certain impediments to marriage by reason of adoption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Neither are the children of <span style="">the adopted considered </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">descendants of the adopter </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Civil Code, <span class="GramE">Vol</span>. I, 1960 Ed., p. 652, citing 1 <span class="SpellE">Oyuelos</span> 284; Perez Gonzalez and <span class="SpellE">Castan</span>;
4-11 <span class="SpellE">Enneccerus</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kipp</span> &amp;
Wolff 177; <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, p. 104).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So even considered in relation to <span style="">the </span>rules on succession which are in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pari</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>materia</u></span>, </span>the
adoption under consideration would not be objectionable <span style="">on the ground alone of the resulting dual </span>relationship between
the <span style="">adopter and the </span><span style="">adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar dual relationship also result under
our law on marriage when persons who are already related, </span>by blood or by
affi<span style="">nity, marry each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as </span>long as the relation­ship is
not within <span style="">the degrees prohibited by
law, such marriage are allowed, notwithstanding the resulting dual
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as <span class="GramE">We</span>
</span>do <span style="">not
</span>find any provi­<span style="">sion in the law </span>that
expressly prohibits adoption <span style="">among
relatives, they ought not </span>to be prevented.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">For all the foregoing </span>considerations</b>,
the deci­<span style="">sion appealed from </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">set </span>aside, and the petition for the adoption of the <span style="">subject minor, </span>granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No p<span style="">ronouncement
