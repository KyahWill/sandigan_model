				<H3>KISHU DALAMAL, PETITIONER, VS. DEPORTATION BOARD, RESPONDENT. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Kishu Dalamal,  a British subject, was  charged, together with other aliens, with having committed  certain
    
irregularities in violation of the Central Bank Rules and
    
Regulations before the Deportation Board in a complaint
    
filed by a  Special Prosecutor of the Department of Justice.<div align="justify">
<p>Acting  on the complaint, the Chairman of the Deportation Board issued a warrant of arrest against  Dalamal
      
pursuant to the authority given  to said Board by Section
      
1(b) of  Executive Order No. 398.   On  August 5,  1958,
      
Dalamal was accordingly arrested,  but he  was subsequently released upon filing a bond in the amount of P10,000.00. </p>
<p>Considering that the warrant for  his arrest issued  by
        
the Deportation Board is illegal because it was issued in
        
violation of Section 1(3), Article III, of our Constitution,
        
Dalamal interposed the present petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> seeking the annulment of the warrant of arrest  as well
        
as the cancellation of  the bond  filed  by him for his provisional liberty.</p>
<p>The grounds on  which the  illegality  of the warrant
          
of arrest are predicated  may be itemized as follows:  (a)
          
Section l(b)  of  Executive  Order No. 398 under which
          
the  warrant of arrest  was issued  by the  Deportation
          
Board is repugnant to Section 1(3), Article  III,  of  our
          
Constitution, under which only  judges are empowered to
          
issue warrants, either of arrest or  of search, and only
          
upon probable  cause, to  be determined by a  judge after
          
examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant
          
or  the witnesses  he may  produce;  and   (b) assuming
          
  <i>arguendo</i> that  the President has the power to order the
          
arrest of an alien as an incident  of his power of investigation with a view to his deportation, the delegation of such
          
power to the Deportation Board is unlawful it being in
          
violation of the principle that a  power that has been delegated by  Congress cannot in turn be delegated.</p>
<p>Before we go into the merits of the case, let us make
            
a brief digression.</p>
<p>During the American regime it was the Governor General who exercised
the power to deport aliens upon the authority of Section 69 of Act
2711, known as the Administrative Code of 1917. Pursuant thereto, the
Governor General designates an agent for the purpose of investigating
the charges preferred against him, and upon the report he may later
submit, the alien's deportation is either ordered or denied. The
investigation is conducted in the manner and form prescribed in said
Section 69 (<i>In  re</i> McCulloch  Dick, 38 Phil., 41).</p>
<p>Prior to Section 69 of the Administrative Code of 1917 the statute
which was then in force authorizing the Governor General to institute
and maintain deportation proceedings against aliens was Act No. 2113
which also prescribed the manner and form in which the investigation
should be conducted. The provisions of this Act were later incorporated
into the Administrative Code of 1916, which in turn were later
incorporated into and embodied in Section 69 of the Administrative Code
of 1917. It may, therefore, be said that this Section 69 is now the
only provision governing deportation proceedings in the Philippines
incident to the power of deportation of the President. </p>
<p>Section 69 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  69. <em>Deportation of subject to foreign power.</em>â€”A
subject of a foreign power residing in the Philippines shall not be
deported, expelled, or excluded from said Islands or repatriated to his
own country by the President of the Philippines except upon prior
investigation, conducted by said Executive or his authorized agent, of
the ground upon which such action is contemplated. In such case the
person concerned shall be informed of the charge or charges against him
and he shall be allowed not less than three days for the preparation of
his defense. He shall also have the right to be heard by himself or
counsel, to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to cross-examine
the opposing witnesses."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Is there any provision in the section above-quoted which
                    
authorizes the  President, directly or indirectly, to  issue a
                    
warrant of arrest against an alien  in the course of his investigation with a view to determining if he  is liable for
                    
deportation?</p>
<p>We find none. The section merely prescribes the procedure to be
followed in the deportation proceedings, such as there must be prior
investigation during which the "person concerned shall be informed of
the charge or charges against him and he shall be allowed not less than
three days for the preparation of his defense." He shall also have the
right to be heard by himself or counsel, to produce witnesses in his
own behalf, and to cross-examine the opposing witnesses. And yet, it
was under the authority of this section that Executive Order No. 398
was promulgated which, among others, authorizes the Deportation Board
to order the arrest of the alien complained of. Verily, this order
transcends the authority given to the President by Section 69.</p>
<p>It is argued that Executive Order No. 398 insofar as it authorizes
the Deportation Board to issue warrants of arrest against the aliens
complained of is violative of Section 1(3), Article III, of our
Constitution, which provides that "no warrants shall issue but upon
probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination under
oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may
produce," upon the theory that only judges may issue such warrants,
whether of arrest or of search, and only upon probable cause, a
requirement not prescribed in Executive Order No. 398. On this point,
there is a divergence of opinion on the part of the members of the
Court; some expressed the view that the pertinent provision of our
Constitution only refers to criminal proceedings, where a judge is the
sole arbiter, while other members opined that it involves both criminal
as well as administrative. We will not however elaborate on this point
it being unnecessary for the decision of this case.</p>
<p><i>In re</i>  McCulloch Dick,  <i>supra</i>,  this  Court  stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * deportation  of aliens by  the Governor-General,  as  an
                              
act of state, upon  prior investigation conducted  in  the manner
                              
and form prescribed in section 69 of the Administrative  Code  may
                              
properly  be regarded as made 'under the combined powers  of the
                              
Governor-General and the Philippine Legislature; authority for such
                              
deportations having been conferred upon the Governor-General,  so
                              
far as that may be  necessary, by the provisions  of that section. </p>
  <p>"* * * the Supreme  Court  of  the  United States" has held,  in
                                
the case  of Tiaco vs. Forbes (<i>supra</i>), not only that Congress has
                                
the power to do  so,  but that it did  in fact delegate full  power
                                
to the Philippine  Government to deport aliens as an act of state;
                                
and, further, that when the Governor-General does in fact  deport
                                
an alien, by authority of an Act of the Philippine Legislature, the
                                
deportation may properly be treated as an act of state, done under
                                
'the combined powers' of the Philippine Legislature  and the Governor-General." (38 Phil.,  pp. 71,  98-99)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever,  therefore, the President exercises  his power
                              
of deporting  an alien upon prior investigation conducted
                              
in the  manner and form prescribed in Section 69 of  the
                              
Administrative Code of  1917, he does so,  not only as an
                              
act  of  state,  but also "under the  combined powers"  of
                              
the  President and the Legislature.  As an  act of state,
                              
the President has the inherent power to order  the deportation of an alien and as  incident thereof, his arrest, while
                              
at the same time that power may be deemed vested in him
                              
thru  delegation by the Legislative thru the enactment of
                              
appropriate statute  (Section  69, Revised  Administrative
                              
Code).   But  insofar as  his power to order the arrest of
                              
an alien is concerned, either  as a  measure to  insure  his
                              
appearance at the investigation  proceedings to determine
                              
if he is liable to deportation,  or as  an  incident  of  his
                              
inherent power to deport to make effective his deportation
                              
order, assuming only <i>arguendo</i> that he has such incidental
                              
power,  that  power  cannot be delegated either  under  the
                              
principle of<em> delegata potesta non potest delegari</em><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> or upon
                              
the theory  that it is non-delegable because it  involves  the
                              
exercise of judgment or discretion.</p>
<p>Thus, in a case we recently decided, we  made, thru Mr.
                      
Justice  Barrera,  the following  observation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Unquestionably, the exercise of the power to order
the arrest of an individual demands the exercise of discretion by the
one issuing the same, to determine whether under specific
circumstances, the curtailment of the liberty of such person is
warranted. The fact that the Constitution itself, as well as the
statute relied upon prescribe the manner by which the warrant may be
issued, conveys the intent to make the issuance of such warrant
dependent upon conditions the determination of the existence of which
requires the use of discretion by the person issuing the same. In other
words, the discretion of whether a warrant of arrest shall issue or not
is personal to the one upon whom the authority devolves. And
authorities are to the effect that while ministerial duties may be
delegated, official functions requiring the exercise of discretion and
judgment, may not be so delegated. Indeed,. an implied grant of power,
considering that no expresa authority was granted by the law on the
matter under discussion, that would serve as a curtailment or
limitation on the fundamental right of a person, such as his security
to life and liberty, must be viewed with caution, if we are to give
meaning of the guarantee contained in the constitution. If this is so,
then a delegation of that implied power, nebulous as it is, must be
rejected as inimical to the liberties of the people. The guarantees of
human rights and freedom can not be made to rest precariously on such a
shaky foundation. (Qua Chee Gan, et al. <i>vs.</i> The Deportation Board, G.  R. No. L-10280,
                            
September 30, 1963)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our conclusion,  therefore,  is  that Executive Order No.
                      
398 insofar as it authorizes the Deportation Board to issue
                      
warrants of arrests against aliens complained of is null
                      
and  void, it being a power that cannot be delegated, nor
                      
is authorized by Section  69 of the Revised Administrative
                      
Code.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  petition is  granted.  The  warrant of  arrest  issued by respondent is hereby set aside and the bond
                      
put up by  petitioner cancelled.  No costs.</p>
