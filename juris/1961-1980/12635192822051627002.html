(now G.R. L-24706).</p>

<p class="BODY">As the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are now beyond
review, we quote them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Trinidad H. <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> was the primitive owner of a mass of land known as
"Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mababanaba</span>," located in the bar­rios
of <st1:city><st1:place>Burgos</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Mababanaba</span>
and Villa <span class="SpellE">Agli­pay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to original certificate of title No. 31, issued to <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> way back on <st1:date year="1908" day="14" month="9">September
 14, 1908</st1:date>, which title was based on an old magnetic survey, the land
had an area of 683.4739 hectares.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1920" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1920</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> sold the land to Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and as a consequence original certificate of title No. 31 was cancelled and
transfer certificate of title No. 359 was issued to the vendee on <st1:date year="1920" day="14" month="9">Septem­ber 14, 1920</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime in 1921, the land, then known as "Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>," became the subject of several civil cases
filed by Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of said cases was the absence of
fixed boundaries of the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
connection with the cases aforesaid, the court appointed a commission of three
surveyors to relocate the lines of the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surveyors reported that it was
impracticable and well-nigh impossible to re­locate the hacienda because
"the starting point called for in the plan of the Hacienda as ‘<span class="SpellE">Buntoc</span> <span class="SpellE">Damulag</span>’ is such a vague
point as its posi­tion cannot be fixed owing to the fact that even the surveyor
who executed the mentioned plan ignores the practicability of determining it on
the ground as the mountain called also by that name '<span class="SpellE">Buntoc</span>
<span class="SpellE">Damulag</span>’ consists of a chain of small hills, so that
upon using any hill as the initial point of the survey, unless the right one is
used, the land covered by the plan may be shifted from its present position as
to be farther East or farther West from where it should be were the true
initial point known." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
1-C-Gov. and 1-E-Gov., registration case 3387.)</span> During the cadastral
survey of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> sometime in 1931, <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Santiago, a district land officer, reported to
the Director of Lands that the district land office "cannot locate any
existing corners (of the hacienda) and even the owner himself or his men cannot
show any monu­ment, hence, the delay of some public land sur­veys on
hand." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-A-Gov., </span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">Id.</span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE">)</span> It was
suggested that a resurvey of the hacienda be made to avoid conflict with public
land appli­cants in possession of portions of land adjoin­ing the
hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this suggestion,
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> caused a resurvey of the hacienda
sometime in 1933.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resurvey was
undertaken by <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Santiago, who at that time
was already a private land surveyor, and a plan, Rs-414-D, was prepared by
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resurvey of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
was done according to modern (tran­sit) methods, and it showed an area of
683.7638 hectares or an excess of a mere 2,899 square meters over the area
stated in the title of <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
was informed by a public land surveyor named <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
that the resurvey of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> did
not include certain portions of the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon this information, an additional survey was made by <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> and another plan, Ps-15499, was prepared and the
said survey and plan of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> showed an excess
of about 34 hectares over the original area of the hacienda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately after the resurvey of Santiago but before the
additional survey of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed a petition in registration case No. 3387,
asking the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to
approve plan Rs-414-D and confirm his title over 683 hectares which was the
area of the hacienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
execution of the ad­ditional survey of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> amended his petition and asked the
court "that the plans Rs-414-D and Psu-15499 be approved; that the
correction of errors of closure in the technical description of the Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 359 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tar­lac</span>
be ordered, and that the cancellation of this transfer certificate of title be
ordered and, in lieu thereof, a new one in accordance with said plans and the
technical description be issued." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">B-2 and B-3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> in this case were the Director of Forestry,
Director of Lands, and a number of occupants of public land adjoin­ing the
hacienda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In another case filed with the same court by Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, civil case No. 4255, he asked "for the
confirmation of his ownership to 79 hectares (the survey of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
showed an excess of 34 odd hectares only) alleged to be within transfer
certificate of title No. 359, and for the possession thereof." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">B-3.)</span>
The defendants in this civil case were, among others, <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Merto</span> and Roman <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In registration case No. 1890, G.L.R.O. Record No. 50732, one Pedro
<span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span> sought "the registration of two parcels
of land, por­tions of which are alleged to be included in Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 359 of Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">B-3 and
B-4.)</span> The Director of Lands and Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
opposed this application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Registration Case No. 3387, civil case No. 4255, and registration
case No. 1890 were tried jointly, after which a decision was ren­dered on <st1:date year="1938" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1938</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the plans of the petitioner Rs-414-D and
Psu-15499, marked in the record of land case No. 3387 as Exhibits A, B and
B-1-Dizon, are hereby approved, and the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> is hereby ordered to can­cel Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 359 and to issue in lieu there­of, a new one under the same per­sonal
circumstances of the petitioner, in accordance with said plans and their
technical descrip­tions, subject to a mortgage lien in favor of the Philippine
National Bank in the sum of P45,000.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In Civil Case No. 4255, so much of the portions of the new
sur­veys in the possession of the defend­ants are hereby ordered vacated and
the defendants are also ordered to deliver them to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In land Case No. 1890, G.L.R.O. Record No. 50732, the
portions in­cluded in the new survey (Psu-15499) are hereby ordered excluded
from the plan of the applicant Exhibit A (psu-­90154) and the rest is hereby
ordered registered in the name of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>,

overruled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once this adjudication shall
have be­come final and amended plan submitted, duly approved by the Director of
Lands, let the decree and title for said re­maining portion be issued."</p>

<blockquote>From this order, the Director of Lands thru the provincial fiscal
appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, upon
petition of the Solicitor General and by resolution of March 1, 1940, dismissed
the appeal in registration case 3387 (CA-G.R. No. 5124) "without prejudice
to the appeal in­terposed by said <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>-appellant
in case CA-G.R. No. 5125 (registration case 1890), Pedro <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>
1.o vs. Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> et al." What happened to
this latter case, the records before us do not show.</blockquote>

the hacienda was a single mass of land.<span style="">&nbsp;

said mass was divided into 17 lots which are now parti­cularly described in the

additional sur­vey, which later gave rise to another Plan Ps-15499, the result
of which was an <u>additional 34 hectares</u> over and above the area of the
Hacienda as originally registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>
and subsequently confirmed by the <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
resurvey.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the resurvey of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
but before the addi­tional survey of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed a petition in Registration Case
No. 3387 for the approval of the San­tiago Plan Rs-414-D and the confirmation

of T.C.T. No. 359 issued in his name on September 14, 1920, and the
cancellation of the latter and the issuance in its stead of a new one in ac­cordance
with the aforesaid plans and the technical des­criptions submitted to the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was opposed by the
Director of Forestry, the Director of Lands and a number of occupants of public
land adjoining the Ha­cienda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Registration Case No. 3387, insofar as it involved the petitions
of Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> mentioned above, was tried jointly
with Civil Case No. 4255 and Registration Case No. 1890 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Civil Case No. 4255 was an action filed by Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
against several parties, among them being <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Merto</span> and Roman <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>, in
which he prayed for the confirmation of his ownership to 79 hectares (albeit
the survey of <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> showed only an excess of 34
hectares over the original area of the Hacienda) alleged to be within the land
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 359 issued in his name, and for
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> of
the defendants found occupying different portions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Registration Case No. 1890, one Pedro <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span> sought to register in his name two parcels of land
portions of which were allegedly included in <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
Transfer Certifi­cate of Title No. 359.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the joint trial of the three cases, the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> rendered the decision of <st1:date year="1938" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1938</st1:date> mentioned heretofore and from
which the Director of Lands seasonably appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on March 1, 1940 the Court of
Appeals, upon petition of the Solicitor General, dismissed the appeal insofar
as it referred to Registration Case No. 3387 (said appeal was docketed as
CA-G.R. L-5124) but "without prejudice to the appeal interposed by said <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>-appellant in Case CA­-G.R. No. 5125 (Registration

1933 and May 11, 1933; that is, years prior to the filing of the petitions of
Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in Registration Case No. 3387 ask­ing
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to approve
Plans Rs-414-D and Psu-15499, and more than five years prior to the decision of
October 12, 1938.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted in the first place that whatever alleged
adjudication was made in favor of Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> of
the additional 34 hectares discovered by private surveyor <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>
was not made in a regular registration proceed­ing, neither was there
compliance with the requirements of the law regarding notice to parties
affected by the peti­tions, the owners of land adjoining the lots involved
therein, and notice to the whole world by publication—requirements
indispensable in all proceedings <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>
intended to register land in the name of a particular party.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended, however, that <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
petition was in the nature of a <u>continuation</u> of the original
registration proceedings commenced in the name of Trinidad H. <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> <u>prior to the
year 1908</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considered even in this
light, said proceedings and the decision rendered therein are void and of no
legal force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have so held
recently in two related cases entitled <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> de la
Cruz et al., petitioners vs. <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> et al., respondents, and Francisco Juan et al.,
petitioners vs. <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>
et al., respondents, G.R. Nos. L-29792 and L-29866, respec­tively, which
involved facts very similar to, if not on all fours with the ones before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant facts in G.R. L-29792 are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to <st1:city><st1:place>Homestead</st1:place></st1:city>
Patent No. V-21853 issued by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, by authority of the Presi­dent of the Philippines, on <u>July 28,
1954,</u> in accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 141,
Original Certificate of Title No. P-1870 was issued in the name of Simeon
Gutierrez by the Office of the Register of Deeds for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="8"><u>August 18, 1956</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It covered Lots Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of plan H-105846
(hereinafter referred to simply as Lots 1, 2 and 3) — identical in technical
description and in area to Lots 1896, 1914 and 1913, respectively, of the
Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> (certificate issued by the Acting District Land Officer
of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> on July 11,
1968 marked as Annex A-1 and appearing at p. 12 of the record).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the course of time Lots 1 and 2 were acquired by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz in whose name
Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-69521 was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Cruz also
acquired Lot 3-A of <u>subdivision plan</u> (LRC) Psd-69137, with an area of
12,482 square meters, the same being a portion of Lot 3 (which corresponds to
Lot No. 1913 of the Sta. Rosa Cadastre), Trans­fer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">NT-70380 having been issued in his name.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, petitioner Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sangabol</span>
acquired Lot No. 3-C of the aforesaid <u>subdivision</u> plan (LRC) Psd-69137,
the same being a portion of 30,003 sq. m. of Lot No. 3, and as a result Trans­fer
Certificate of Title NT-69551 was issued in his name and that of his wife,
Francisca del Rosario.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It further appears that by virtue of a parti­tion agreement
inscribed on June 16, 1967, Lot 3-B of same <u>subdivision plan</u> (LRC)
Psd-69137 - the remaining portion of Lot 3 - was acquired by the other petitioner,
Lucia Gutierrez, to whom Trans­fer Certificate of Title No. NT-70251 was
issued.</blockquote>

Original Certificate of Title No.</span> P-1870 - private respondent <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed in
Cadastral Case No. 67 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> a verified "Petition for <u>Continuation</u>
of Cadastral Proceedings" (Underline supplied), alleging, substantially,
that he was the owner of a parcel of land covered by Plan Psu-66102 approved by
the Director of Lands on November 15, 1929, having acquired it from the
previous owner, Pedro Padilla, who subsequently allowed it to be subdivided
into 30 cadastral lots with an aggregate area identical to that of the land
described in the aforesaid plan; that he had sufficient evidence to prove his
title thereto and, on the strength of said allegations, prayed <u>for the
lifting of the order of general default</u> entered in said Cadastral Case No.
67, and that, after pro­per proceedings, decision be rendered adju­dicating the
aforesaid lots in his favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 16 of the same year, Judge <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
R. Cuevas, then presiding the lower court, rendered judgment adjudicating a
number of lots in favor of <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>, among them being Lots 1896, 1913 and 1914 of the
Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 6,
1968, alleging that, pur­suant to said decision, the decree of regis­tration as
well as the corresponding original certificates of title No. 3187 (for
Cadastral Lot No. 1896); No. 3178 (for Id. Lot No. 1913), and No. 3176 (for Id.
Lot No. 1914) had been issued in his name, said respondent filed an ex—<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion with the lower court praying for the issuance
of a writ of possession di­recting any officer of the law to place him in
physical possession of the lands covered by said titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was heard and subsequently
granted ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when the writ of possession issued on the 11th of the same
month was served upon petitioners that they learned of the proceedings
instituted by <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> and discovered that Cadastral
Lots Nos. 1896, 1913 and 1914 — which were already covered by Original
Certificate of Title No. P-1870 is­sued since <st1:date year="1956" day="18" month="8"><u>August 18, 1956</u></st1:date> in the name of their predecessor in
interest, Simeon Gutierrez — <span class="GramE">were</span> among those
adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, they filed with the lower court a verified motion to set
aside the writ of pos­session, but the same was denied by the respon­dent judge
in his order of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their motion for reconsideration filed there­after
having been likewise denied by His Honor in an order of October 29 of the same

<p class="BODY">Our findings of fact in the other case (G.R. L-29866) are similar
to those reproduced above.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with both cases <span class="GramE">We</span> said in
our joint decision:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"On May 16, 1966, or eighteen years after
the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No.</span> P-275, private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>
filed a "Petition for <u>Continuation</u> of Cadastral Proceedings"
in Cadastral Case No. 67 praying for the <u>setting aside of the order of
general default</u> entered in said proceeding and for the registration in his
name of several parcels of land situated in Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, among them being Lot No. 1863 of the Cadastral
Survey of said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November
16 of the same year the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, acting as a cadastral court ren­dered a
decision adjudicating to respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> the lots
included in his application, including Lot No. 1863.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, alleging that the decision
rendered in his favor had be­come <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and that
Original Certificate of Title No. O-3176 covering <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1863 had been issued in his name, <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for the issuance of a writ of possession
directing any peace officer to place him in possession of several lots, among
them the aforesaid Lot No. 1863.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> hearing, respondent judge granted said mo­tion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On July 3, 1968, having become aware of the situation above
described, petitioners filed a motion praying for the setting aside of the
order for the issuance of the writ of possession mentioned above, but the
respond­ent judge denied it on October 4 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on October 11 petitioners filed another
motion for reconsideration alleging that the title issued in favor of private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> was null and void and, therefore,
should be cancelled, and that the writ of possession mentioned heretofore
should be likewise set aside, but this motion met the same fate by order of the
respondent judge of October 29, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter the <span class="SpellE">Juans</span> filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
(L-29866) now be­fore <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer thereto filed by the pri­vate
respondent alleges substantially the same defenses interposed in his answer in
L-29792.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following are, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, pertinent
and relevant considerations in deciding the two cases before Us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to <st1:city><st1:place>Homestead</st1:place></st1:city>
Patents No. V-31853 granted on <st1:date year="1954" day="28" month="7"><u>July
 28, 1954</u></st1:date>, Original Certificate of Title No. P-1870 was issued
in the name of Simeon Gutierrez on <u>August 18, 1956</u>, the same covering
Lots Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of Plan H-105846 which, beyond question, cor­respond to
Lots 1896, 1914 and 1913 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, respectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As official duty is presumed to have been duly performed and the
Homestead Patent and Ori­ginal Certificate of Title abovementioned are entitled
to full credit in the absence of clear proof that they were issued illegally or
through fraud, it can be safely said that prior to the issuance of the
aforesaid Homestead Patent, Simeon Gutierrez had filed the corresponding
homestead application; that, after the neces­sary survey had been made and
proper notice was served, the required investigation was conducted by the
State; that applicant Gutierrez was found to have been in possession of the
property ap­plied for and to have made thereon the required cultivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Gutierrez had really been in possession
of said land from the time of the filing of his homestead application, and that
his successors in interest had continued such possession and are still enjoying
the same, is further demonstrated by these facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span>
had to file a peti­tion for the issuance of a writ of possession to oust them
and, in turn, to obtain posses­sion of Lots 1896, 1914 and 1913; secondly, on
May 16, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed in Cadastral Case No. 67 a
"Petition for Continuation of Cadas­tral Proceedings" and for the
setting aside of the order of <u>general default</u> already en­tered therein;
all of which necessarily means that Pedro Padilla, his alleged predecessor in
interest, <u>had not claimed</u> Lots 1896, 1914 and 1913 when the proceedings
were started.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1966</st1:date> or more than ten years after the issuance of
the Home­stead Patent in favor of Simeon Gutierrez, and nearly ten years after
the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No. P-1870 that private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed a petition to register in his
name the same cadastral lots.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of G.R. L-29866, Home­stead Patent
No. <span class="GramE">D-995 and Original Certificate of Title No.</span> P-275
- both covering Lot No. 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> - were issued on the
same date - <st1:date year="1948" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1948</st1:date> -
in the name of Mariano Juan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in the
case of the lots involved in L-29792, it must likewise be presumed that prior
to July 24, 1948 Mariano Juan had been in posses­sion of and had been cultivating
Lot 1863, and that it was only after adequate investigations had been made by
the Bureau of Lands that the Homestead Patent in his favor was issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was only on May 16, 1966, or eighteen full years after the
issuance of the Homestead Patent and Original Certificate of Title already
mentioned, that <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed a petition for the
continuation of the proper cadastral proceedings so that he could claim several
lots, among them Lot 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Further proof of the fact that Mariano Juan and, after his death,
his heirs have been and still are in possession of Lot 1863 is the fact that <span class="SpellE">Reano’s</span> alleged predecessor in interest did not file his
answer or claim to Lot 1863 at the start of the cadastral proceedings and was
therefore included in the order of general default issued therein, and he (<span class="SpellE">Reano</span>) had to file on June 6, 1968 an ex–<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for the issuance of a writ of possession under
which he could eject the <span class="SpellE">Juans</span> from Lot 1863 and, in
turn, obtain possession thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The issue arising from the above facts may be briefly stated as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>May a parcel of land already titled for more than ten years in the
name of a party by virtue of a Homestead Patent issued by the Government in the
ordinary course of administrative proceedings, be registered again in the name
of another party as a result of sub­sequent cadastral proceedings?</blockquote>

<blockquote>The answer, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, must be in the
negative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lukban</span>,
et al., Vol. 48, Phil. p. 973, We held that land granted by the Government to a
private individual who applied for it as a homestead, is considered no longer <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> within the meaning of the Land Registration
Act after the issuance of the homestead patent and the original certificate of
title issued in accordance therewith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> vs. San Agustin et al., 43
Phil. 558, as well as in El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino vs. <span class="SpellE">Olviga</span>, 60 Phil. p. 17, We likewise held that in a
cadastral proceeding the Court has no jurisdiction to decree again the
registration of land already decreed and registered in an earlier registration
case, and that the second decree entered for the same land is null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, considering that the petitioners in both cases before Us
and their predecessors had been in possession of the land, first as
homesteaders and later, as absolute owners, for more than ten years before
respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed his application for
registration; that, as a result of the proceedings had in connection with their
Homestead application, the homestead patents and original certificate of title
mentioned heretofore were issued in their name, no further argument is needed
to show that said petitioners and their predecessors had acquired title to the
land by prescription.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It being clear from the foregoing that the registration decreed in
the name of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> of Lots 1896,
1914, 1913 and 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> is null and void, the certificates of title
covering the same issued in his name must also be deemed null and void. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>From this the inevitable conclusion is that he
had no right to the issuance of the writs of possession complained of."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While in view of what has been stated heretofore it would seem
unnecessary to further discuss the question of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> as well as the plea of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> invoked by petitioner against private respondents,
We wish to add in relation to such matters that the October 12, 1938 decision
having been the subject of an appeal and there being nothing in this record to
show what had become of it, as the Court of Appeals declared in its appealed
joint decision, We cannot see how it can be legally maintained that the
aforesaid decision constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can <span class="GramE">We</span> see Our way clear to upholding
petitioner's conten­tion of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> in the face of
the registered titles over the lots in dispute issued in the name of the
private respondents and/or their predecessors in interest, their actual
occupancy of the disputed lots and their claim of exclusive ownership thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two questions raised by petitioner remain to be resolved,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that it was error for the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to try and decide jointly
the two cases mentioned heretofore (Civil Cases Nos. 986 and 1085 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>), and petitioner's claim
against the Assurance Fund.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention in relation to both issues is without
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The joint trial of the two cases was obviously one within the
sound discretion of the trial court to determine and it is manifest from the
record that it did not, in fact, it could not have reasonably caused any
substantial prejudice to the cause and interest of the petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is obvious that any error
committed below in connection with this matter is purely technical and is not a
reversible error.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to petitioner's recourse against the Assurance Fund
it is clear that, under the law, recovery from the latter for wrongful
deprivation of land may lie only if it is proven that the claimant was in reality
wrongfully deprived of his land by the registration thereof in the name of
another person through actual or constructive fraud; that there was no
negligence on his part; that he is not barred or in any way precluded from
bringing an action for the recovery of the land or interest therein, and lastly,
that the action for compensation has not prescribed (<span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>
et al., vs. Martinez 48 Phil. 256-265).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lands claimed by petitioner herein were found by the Court of
Appeals to be not a part of the Hacienda acquired by Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> from Trinidad H. <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> and later acquired by petitioner's predecessor in
interest from the heirs of Segundo <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, it also appears from
what has been said heretofore that the private respondents and/or their
predecessors in interest acquired the disputed lots legally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it appears clear that petitioner was not
deprived of any land belonging to him through its fraudulent registration in
the name of other persons, its claim against the Assurance Fund cannot be
sustained.</p>

Appeals is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
