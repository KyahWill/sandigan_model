				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In a complaint for unfair labor 
practice filed before the Court of Industrial Relations on June 6, 1956 by a 
Prosecutor of the latter court, Emilio, <span class="SpellE">Ariston</span> and 
Rodolfo, all surnamed Cano, were made respondents in their capacity as president 
and proprietor, field supervisor and manager respectively, of Emilio Cano 
Enterprises, Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After trial, Presiding Judge Jose 
S. Bautista rendered decision finding Emilio Cano and Rodolfo Cano guilty of 
unfair labor practice charge, but absolved <span class="SpellE">Ariston</span> for 
insufficiency of evidence. As a consequence, the two were ordered, jointly and 
severally, to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> Cruz to her former 
position with payment of back wages from the time of her dismissal up to her 
reinstatement, together with all other rights and privileges thereunto 
appertaining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Meanwhile, Emilio Cano died on 
</span><st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1958"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 14, 
1958</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
the attempt to have the case dismissed against him having failed, the case was 
appealed to the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">en 
banc</span></em>, which in due course affirmed the decision of Judge Bautista. 
An order of execution was issued on August 23, 1961 the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads: (1) to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> Cruz to her former position as ordered in the 
decision; and (2) to deposit with the court the amount of P7<span class="GramE">,222.58</span> within ten days from receipt of the order, failing 
which the court will order either a levy on respondents' properties or the 
filing of an action for contempt of court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The order of execution having 
been directed against the properties of Emilio Cano Enterprises, Inc. instead of 
those of the respondents named in the decision, said corporation filed an 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></em> motion to quash the writ on the ground 
that the judgment sought to be enforced was not rendered against it which is a 
juridical entity separate and distinct from its officials. This motion was 
denied. And having failed to have it reconsidered, the corporation interposed 
the present petition for certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The issue posed before us is: Can 
the judgment rendered against Emilio and Rodolfo Cano in their capacity as 
officials of the corporation Emilio Cano Enterprises, Inc. be made effective 
against the property of the latter which was not a party to the 
case?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The answer must be in the 
affirmative. While it is an undisputed rule that a corporation has a personality 
separate and distinct from its member or stockholders because of a fiction of 
the law, here we should not lose sight of fact that the Emilio Cano Enterprises, 
Inc. is a closed family corporation where the incorporators and directors belong 
to one single family. Thus, the following are its incorporators: Emilio Cano, 
his wife Juliana, Rodolfo and Carlos, and his daughter-in-law Ana D. <span class="SpellE">Caño</span> Hero is an instance where the corporation and its 
members can be considered as one. And to hold such entity liable for the acts of 
its members is not to ignore the legal fiction but merely to give meaning to the 
principle that such fiction cannot be invoked if its purpose is to use it as a 
shield to further an end subversive of justice.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> And so it has been held that while a 
corporation is a legal entity existing separate and apart from the persons 
composing it, that concept cannot be extended to a point beyond its reason and 
policy, and when invoked in support of an end subversive of this policy it 
should be disregarded by the courts (12 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., 
160-161).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A factor that should not be 
overlooked is that Emilio and Rodolfo Cano are here indicated, not in their 
private capacity, but as president and manager, respectively, of Emilio Cano 
Enterprises, Inc. Having been sued officially their connection with the case 
must be deemed to be impressed with the representation of the corporation. In 
fact, the court's order is for them to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span> Cruz to her former position in the corporation and 
incidentally pay her the wages she had been deprived of during her separation. 
Verily, the order against them is in effect against the corporation. No benefit 
can be attained if this case were to be remanded to the court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> merely in response to a technical 
substitution of parties for such would only cause an unwarranted delay that 
would work to <span class="SpellE">Honorata's</span> prejudice. This is contrary 
to the spirit °f the law which enjoins a speedy adjudication of labor cases 
disregarding as much as possible the technicalities of procedure. We, therefore, 
find unmeritorious the relief herein prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, petition is dismissed, with 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
