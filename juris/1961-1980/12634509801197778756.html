				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the Solicitor General from the decision of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> granting the
petition of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Antonina</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>, for a change of name.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Antonina</span></span><span style=""> </span>B. <span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>
filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> a
petition to have her name changed from "<span class="SpellE">Antonina</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>" to "<span class="SpellE">Antonina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was signed by the petitioner herself and was
"subscribed and sworn to" by her before the Deputy Clerk of Court.
The requirements for the publication of the hearing of the petition were duly
complied with Asst. City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> M. Barnes,
acting <span style="">in </span>behalf of the
Solicitor General, filed a mo­tion to dismiss the petition upon the grounds (1)
of lack of jurisdiction, in that although the petition was subscribed and sworn
to by petitioner, it was not veri­fied in accordance with the provisions of
Section <span style="">6, </span>Rule 15 of the Rules
of Court; and (2) that the petition does not state a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>
filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court denied the motion to dismiss and set the case for
hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the lower court, the evidence has established that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Antonina</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Oshita</span> is the legiti­mate daughter of <span class="SpellE">Kishimatsu</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>, a Japanese citizen, now deceased, and Buena <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, a Filipina; that she was born in the City of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on <span style="">May </span>9,
1940 and has since then, up to the time <span style="">of
</span>the hearing, resided in said city; that upon reaching the age of
majority, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> elected Philippine citizenship and
took her oath of allegiance; that being already a Filipino citizen she desired
to have her family name changed from "<span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>"
to "<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>", the latter being the family
name of her mother, and because she felt embarrassed when introduced as one
bearing a Japanese surname; that her older brother and sister, who had earlier
elected Philippine citizenship, have been using the surname "<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>"; and that she has no criminal record nor a
pending tax liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Assistant City Attorney of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City did not present any evidence in support of his opposition to the petition,
but simply reiterated his motion to dismiss. On <st1:date year="1962" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1962</st1:date>, the trial court rendered a decision
granting the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal by the Solicitor General.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal, the Solicitor General insists (1) that the lower
court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case because the petition
was not verified as required by Section 2 of Rule 103 of the Rules <span style="">of </span>Court, and (2) that no sufficient
reason had been shown to justify the change of the surname of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This appeal has no
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted that the petition </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not verified in the </span>manner <span style="">as
prescribed in Section </span>6 of Rule 15 of the old Rules of Court (now Sec­tion
6 of Rule 7 of the new Rules of Court), because what appears is a simple <span class="SpellE">Surat</span> by the Deputy Clerk of Court that the petitioner had
subscribed and sworn to, the petition, before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that under Section 2, Rule
103, it is required that the petition for change of name be verified,
nevertheless, no provision exists in the rules which declares that such a
requirement regarding verification is jurisdictional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement regarding verification of a
pleading is simply intended to secure an assurance that what are alleged in the
pleading are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a
matter of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement regarding verification of a
pleading is simply a condition affecting the form of pleading,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the non-compliance of which does not neces­sarily render the pleading fatally
defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may order the
correction of the pleading if the verifi­cation is lacking, or act on the
pleading although it is not verified if the <span style="">attending </span><span style="">circumstances </span>are
such that the strict compliance with the rule may be dispensed with in order
that the ends of justice or the law may thereby be served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view finds support in the ruling laid
down by this Court in several decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <span class="GramE">The</span> Philippine Bank of Commerce vs. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>,
et al., G.R. No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">L-14174, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="10"><span class="GramE"><span style="">October 31, 1960</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, the petition for
certiorari was attacked as fatally defective because it was not verified as
required by the provision of Sec­tion 1 of Rule </span>67 <span style="">of the Rules of Court (now Section 1, Rule </span>65
<span style="">of the new Rules of Court).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
resolving this question, this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"First, respondents claim that the petition, not being
verified, is fatally defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do
not think so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that Rule 67,
sec. 1, of the Rules of Court, require that the petition for certiorari be
verified the apparent ob<span style="">ject thereof
being to insure good faith in the averments of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, however, the material facts alleged
are a matter of record in the court below, </span><span style="">consisting </span><span style="">in pleadings
filed or proceed­ings taken therein, and the questions raised are mainly of
law, a verification as to the truth of said facts is not an absolute necessity
and may be waived (42 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., sec. 42, p. 177), as
this Court has done in this case when we gave due course to the present petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In fact, many authorities consider the
absence of</u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">verification a mere formal not jurisdictional
defect, the absence of, which does not of itself justify a court in refusing to
allow and act in the case</span></u><span style=""> </span>(71
C.J.S., 744-745)." (Underlining <span style="">supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Likewise, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tavera</span> v. El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Fili­pino,
Inc., et al., 98 Phil. 481, this Court held that "lack of verification of
a petition filed in a probate court for the sale of real property belonging to
the estate of a minor is not a jurisdictional defect."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In a land registration case, notwithstanding
the provision of Section 34, Act 496, which requires that opposition to an
application for registration of land should be sworn to by <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>,
this Court held that an "unverified opposition is sufficient to confer
standing in court to <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the rulings laid down by this Court in the
decisions afore-cited, it is clear that verifi­cation is not a jurisdictional,
but a formal, requisite. While the petition now before Us was not verified, it
was, however, subscribed and sworn to by the petitioner, and We believe that
the lower court did not commit a reversible error when it denied the motion to
dismiss the petition upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction of the court was not
affected by the absence of the proper verification of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be stated here, though, that the lower
court should have re­quired <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to have her
petition verified before set­ting the case for hearing, in order to have the petition
conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also contends that no sufficient reasons had been
shown to justify the grant by the lower court of the petition for a change of
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appel­lant urges that under
Article 364 of the <span style="">Civil </span>Code
legi­timate children shall principally use the surname of the father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision, however, is not absolute
because under Article 264 of the same Code, it is provided that legitimate
children have the right to bear the surname of the father and of the mother.
Hence, if there is suf­ficient reason, the change of a child's surname from
that of the father, to that of the mother, may be authorized by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, it has been shown that the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is the legitimate daughter of Buena <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kishimatsu</span> <span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>; that upon reaching the age of majority she elected
Philippine citizenship and took her oath of allegiance; that being already a <span class="SpellE">Fill<span style="">pino</span></span><span style=""> citizen she desires to adopt a Filipino
surname; that her older brother and sister who had also elected Philippine
citizenship have been using the surname "<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>";
and that she desires to have the surname "<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>"
instead of "<span class="SpellE">Oshita</span>", because she felt em­barrassed
when introduced as one bearing Japanese sur­name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court further observed that
"It can­not be denied that there had been ill feeling among the Filipinos
against the Japanese due to the last Pacific war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although normal relations between the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> have been established the ill <span class="GramE">feelings still persists</span> among some Filipinos especially
among the less educated who had unpleasant experience during the war."
There is no showing that the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was motivated
by any fraudulent purpose, or that the change of her sur­name will prejudice
public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the
lower court acted correctly when it considered these circumstances as reasons
sufficient to justify the change of name as prayed for by the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the matter of
whether to grant or deny a petition for a change of name is left to the sound
dis­cretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following
ruling of this Court is relevant:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In granting or denying petitions for change of name, the
question of 'proper and reasonable cause' is left to the sound discretion of
the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">evidence </span>presented need only be satisfactory to the Court and
not all the best evidence available.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the present case the trial court found to its satisfaction
that petitioner was in earnest in his desire to do away with all traces of his
former Chinese nationality and henceforth to be recognized as a Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such desire is in line with the policy of our
naturalization laws that applicants for naturalization should fully embrace
Filipino customs and traditions and socially mingle with Filipinos.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has not been shown that petitioner has any fraudulent
intent in seeking a change of name. No criminal, civil, tax or any other,
liability on his part, which he may avoid by the change of name, has been
suggested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing has been presented to
show any prejudice to the Government or to any individual should the petition
be granted. In the absence of prejudice to the State or any individual, a sin­cere
desire to adopt a Filipino name <span style="">to </span>erase
signs of a former alien <span style="">nationali­</span>ty
which unduly hamper social and business life, is a proper and reasonable cause
for a change of name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not trivial,
<span style="">whimsical </span>or capricious." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> v. Republic, G.R. No.</span> L-22712,
