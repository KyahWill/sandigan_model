				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Numeriano Reyes owned 18,755 square meters of land, <span style="">covered by Original </span>Certificate of
Title No. 187, situated <span style="">in the
Municipality </span>of San Pedro, Province of Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 9, 1959, expropriation proceedings
over said land were instituted by the government at the instance of the Land
Tenure Administration<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
before the Court of First Instance of Laguna<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for the purpose of subdividing the land and its resale to the bona fide
occupants thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1959, the Court of First Instance of La­guna declared
the government's right to expropriate the land, "with the exception of two
lots - one containing an area of 471 square meters and another with an area of
1,170 square meters because these had already been sold -the first to Felicidad
Reyes-Talag and the second to Jose Oliver." A copy of this decision was
furnished the Re­gister of Deeds and annotated as Entry No. 26592 at the back
of Original Certificate of Title No. 187.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Felicidad Reyes-Talag had the land surveyed, with the
consent of the Land Tenure Administration, se­gregating the 471 square meters
from the rest, she re­quested the Office of the Resister of Deeds to issue her
a new certificate of title covering her portion of the land as mentioned in the
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Acting Register of Deeds, however, required her to produce
the certificate of title covering the whole land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the title certificate was produced, the
Regis­ter of Deeds asked for a document showing that the land was really
transferred to her by Numeriano Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In compliance, Numeriano Reyes himself confirmed in a public instrument
such transfer.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
When Numeriano Reyes died on <span style="">August 8,
1962, Felicidad was also </span>required to produce the certificate of death of
Numeriano Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still not satisfied,
the Register of Deeds required her to produce a deed of confirmation of the
transfer by the heirs of Numeriano Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The heirs obliged, by executing such a Deed of Confirmation dated
September 4, 1964, signed by Reyes widow in her own capacity and as guardian of
the five minors, by Apolonia Bautista as attorney-in-fact of the other three
children, <span style="">as </span>well as by the <span style="">six </span>other children who were already of
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the compliance of <span style="">all his </span>requirements, the Acting
Register of Deeds still refused to issue a new certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on January <span style="">7, </span>1965,
Felicidad Reyes-Talag, al­leging the abovementioned facts, petitioned the Court
of First Instance of Laguna<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for an order directing the Re­gister of Deeds of Laguna to issue a new
certificate of title in her favor covering the 471 square meters of land.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer, the Acting Register of Deeds on January 14, 1965,
manifested that he asked the petitioner to have the confirmation approved by
the Court because some of the parties were minors; that the decision in the
expro­priation case cannot be used, as there is nothing in it that orders the
issuance of a new certificate of title; that petitioner should have taken her
case en consulta to the Land Registration Commission according to Section 4,
Republic Act No. 1151 instead of going to court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After petitioner had filed her memorandum of autho­rities as
required by the court, the latter, on March 27, 1965 denied the petition for
the stated reason that the <span style="">dispositive </span>portion
of the decision in the expropriation case does not mention petitioner's
ownership of the land; that the petitioner was not a party to the expropriation
case; that the acknowledgment of Numeriano Reyes was a private document and is
not one of the modes of conveyin title to real property; that Section 44 of Act
496 in­voked by petitioner covers severance or consolidation of parcels of land
in the issuance of titles of a registered owner and finally, that petitioner
has not satisfactorily shown that she owns the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner moved for
reconsideration on March 27, </span><span style="">1965,
</span><span style="">alleging among others that
through oversight, the acknowledgment of Numeriano Reyes was presented without
the second page which had the notarial acknowledgment. She then asked for the
substitution of that presented </span><span style="">with
another </span><span style="">one showing that the
document was really a public one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of her motion for reconsideration, peti­tioner
appealed to Us questioning the propriety of the lower court's refusal to order
the issuance of a new cer­tificate under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Felicidad Reyes-Talag </span>is
the daughter of Numeriano Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Numeriano Reyes himself has acknowledged in a public instrument that he
had transferred the 471 square meters of land to his daughter.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon qemand by the Register of Deeds, a deed
of confirmation<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
was executed af­ter Numeriano's death where the widow in her own capacity and
as guardian of the five minor children, the attorney­-in-fact of the other
three minor children, as well as the six other children of Numeriano of legal
age, recognized the transfer made in favor of Felicidad Reyes-Talag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of these heirs opposed Felicidad
Reyes-Talag's petition for the issuance of a new certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in their deed of confirmation, they
join Felicidad in the request for the issuance of a new title after explaining
that such land has been excluded from the property covered in the project of
partition submitted to the court in the intes­tate proceedings of their
father's estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the facts of the
present case there is no doubt that all the parties interested recognized
petitioner's ownership over said land, and the absence of opposition and the
particu­lar set of facts and circumstances obtaining in this case, justify the
issuance of a new certificate in Felicidad Reyes-Talag's name.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court erred in stating that in the deci­sion of the
expropriation case there was no adjudication of the land in her favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision, in the disposi­tive portion,
expressly excluded two lots from expropria­tion because the court found in the
body of said decision that these were already sold - one to Felicidad Reyes­Talag
and the other to Jose Oliver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
portion in ques­tion was definitely left out of the expropriated land, of which
it formed part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its owner, who built her
home on it, had the right to see to it that her right is protected by a new
certificate of title in her name.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the nature of Numeriano Reyes, deed of acknowledgment,
Felicidad Reyes-Talag has aptly explained her oversight in presenting the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exhibit <span style="">ck </span>now on the records is a duly
acknowledged document filed, <span style="">before the
office of the Register of Deeds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming, as the lower court held, that Section 44 of Act <span style="">496 </span>on severance or consolidation of
parcels of land in the issuance of titles of a registered owner, does not
apply, the issuance of a new certificate to Fe­licidad Reyes-Talag is
authorized under Section 112 of Act 496, which aside from providing for
erasures or alte­rations, of certificates by court order, also states that <span style="">"x </span>x <span style="">x Any </span>registered
owner or other person in interest <span style="">may </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">any time apply by petition to the Court, upon the ground that
registered interests of any description, </span><span style="">whe­ther </span><span style="">vested,
contingent, expectant or inchoate, have ter­minated and ceased; x x x or upon
any other reasonable ground."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
section expressly provides that after hearing, the court has the power to order
"the entry of a new certificate" or to grant any other relief it may
deem necessary and proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Though there was no formal deed of transfer, the fact of
Numeriano Reyes' deed of acknowledgment and the widow's and heirs' deed of
confirmation, with no opposition what­soever, is enough, in justice to
Felicidad Reyes-Talag, to prove transfer of the portion of land to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such trans­fer, together with the
presentation of the certificate of <span style="">title covering </span>the whole land, warrants the
issuance of a new certificate of title in her favor over the 471 square meters
of land already segregated by a new survey.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the order appealed from is hereby reversed
and the Register of Deeds is ordered to issue a new certi­ficate of title in
favor of Felicidad Reyes-Talag over her 471 square meters of the land in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
