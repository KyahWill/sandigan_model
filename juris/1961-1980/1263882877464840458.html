</span><span style="">compel respondent Judge </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">approve, certify ands elevate the record on appeal in its </span><span style="">Civil Case No. 7300 to this Court, or for
declaration of nullity of the Compromise Agreement of the parties which was
approved by the respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
petition was dismissed by this Court on December 29, 1967, in the following
manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Generally, a judgment on a compromise ag­reement is not only
without appeal, but is also immediately executory, the reason being that when
the parties agree to settle their differences, to <span style="">end a pending litigation, and request the court 'to render judgment
based on their said agreement, there is an implied waiver of their right to ap­peal
from the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception to the
rule is provided in case a party to the compromise agreement moves to set it
aside on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress; in which event, an appeal
would exist from the order denying the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The issue here presented, therefore, is whether or not the
case at bar comes within the exception to the general rule, that the denial of
petitioner's appeal by the lower court amounted to grave abuse of discretion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To fall within the exception to the general rule, the moving
party must allege vitiated eon-sent to the agreement, by reason of fraud,
mistake or duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not every act
that may be consi­dered fraudulent, erroneous or under duress, can be the basis
for annuling a contract. A mistake, specifically, shall invalidate consent only
if it refers to the substance of the thing which is the object of the contract,
or the condition which has principally moved one or both parties to enter into
the contract (Art. 13.31, new Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the error must be the causal, not merely incidental, factor
that induced the complaining party to enter into the agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the present case, the mistake, alluded to by petitioner as
having vitiated the voluntariness of his participation in the compromise
agreement' consisted in the mistaken that he would receive the alloted portion
in his per­sonal capacity; that the properties would belong to him solely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would contradict the explicit
terminology of the 5th paragraph of the agree­ment, partitioning the remaining
unsold lots among the 'incorporators and heirs of the deceased in­corporators',
and which was drafted by no less than appellant's personal counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that from the context of the
agreement, it is apparent that it was entered into to determine the properties
of the Suarez Estate, Inc. and to fix and deliver the respective shares of the
incorpo­rators-contributors, and that it was the wife, Maria Suarez, not the
husband Francisco Periquet, who made contribution to the corporation, it can­not
really he claimed that the lower court made an alteration of the compromise
agreement when it adjudged the 5 lots enumerated in paragraph 6 'as the share
of the co-incorporator-contributor Maria Suarez as such
incorporator-contributor, repres­ented in the compromise agreement by her
surviving spouse Francisco Periquet.' That Periquet origi­nally considered this
order as in accord with the agreement of the parties is evidenced by the fact
that after the judgment was rendered, he filed two motions seeking for its
enforcement or execu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
realizing much later the impli­cation of the phraseology of the agreement, as
carried out in the decision of the lower court, he belatedly contested the
validity and due exe-- cution of said compromise agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But assuming that the effect of the word­ing of paragraph 5
of the agreement was not anti­cipated by petitioner when he and his counsel
prepared the instrumentandprevailed on the other parties to sign it, this is
not the kind of mis­take that would justify nullification thereof.
Miscalculation or misappreciation of its legal import, where the party as in
this case is assis­ted by counsel, will not provide basis for setting aside of
a compromise agreement on the ground of mistake or error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A compromise, entered into and carried out in
good faith, will not be discarded even if there was a mistake of law or fact;
and in this case the parties have gone to the extent of drawing lots as
provided in the seventh (7) paragraph of the compromise agreement (Decision,
Court of First Instance, p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
application of the rule to the present case becomes all the more imperative
when it is borne in mind that Periquet's proposal would result in depriving his
wife's surviving mother, Fiaviana Muli Vda. de Suarez of her hereditary share
in this 36-2/3% and vesting all of it upon the husband, contrary to our laws of
succession. (Civil Code, Art. 997)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant Periquet adverts to the circums­tance that in his
proposals previous to the final compromise agreement, he had insisted in being
personally assigned a share in the properties equal to that granted to his
mother-in-law, Fla­viana Mull.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find
little relevancy in these proposals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
essence of compromises being mu­tual concessions by the parties to avoid or end
litigation, it is to be expected that neither will be able to maintain his
initial demands wholly un­altered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Changes
are naturally made in the course of bargaining, and the final agreement rarely
coincides with the original terms proposed by either side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, as previously remarked, the purpose of
the compromise agreement in question, was in its 4th paragraph, <span style="">'to <i>return</i> </span>to each of the
incorporators their respective contributions' to the capital of Suarez Estate,
Inc., (as ex­pressed in its paragraph 4) and appellant Periquet was concededly
not such an incorporator, while his wife and mother-in-law were, it is difficult
to perceive on what basis Periquet could in law or justice demand any portion
of the distributed properties except as his wife's representative, nor how he
could assert error in his not becoming a distributee in his personal capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Periquet's argument that the Philippine Trust, as
administrator of his late wife's estate did not sign the compromise, is one
that is not available to him for evading the effect of his <span style="">Own </span>consent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, only the Administrator may raise
the objection and its prolonged silence is 'evidentiary of acquiescence to the
compromise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant's contention being plainly unte­nable, there would
be no point in declaring that the Court below abused its discretion in refusing
to give due course to the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
if appel­lant were technically entitled to a <i>mandamus</i>, the net result
would merely be further delay in adjudicating that his case is devoid of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the conclusion thus reached, there is no need to
pass upon the question of the timeliness or untimeliness of the appeal filed by
petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby dismiss­ed, with costs
against the petitioner."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

from the fact that the challenged Orders of respondent Judge, dated May </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1968, May 10, 1968, and September 23, 1968, were null because they
amend­ed or modified the final decision in Civil Case No. 7300, which is beyond
