				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition to annul
the order dated November 18, 1969 of the respondent Judge Alfredo C. <span class="SpellE">Laya</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
(Branch II and Branch XII), ordering and authorizing the board of election
inspectors of precinct 33 of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, "to complete and/or
correct" the election return they had prepared, by (a) including in said
return the name of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>, one of the
candidates for representative of the third congressional dis­trict of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and (c) crediting him with sixty-seven votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court issued the order on the basis of
the sworn testimony of the poll chairman and poll clerk and the unanimous
written sworn pe­tition of the members of the board alleging that because of
"fatigue and exhaustion" they had inadvertently failed to write the
name of candidate <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> "and the number of
votes [obtained by him] per actual count, which is sixty-seven (67), as
reflected in the tally board, in the tally sheet and the advance copy of the
election results."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the elections held on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November
 11, 1969</st1:date> in the third con­gressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, the petitioner Antonio V. <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>
of the Liberal Party and the respondent Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">Nacio­nalista</span> Party were among the candidates
for congressman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election return for
precinct 33 in <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> recites that the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> obtained 61 votes but made no mention of the name of
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gullas</span></span><span class="GramE"> nor</span>
the number of votes cast for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
omission was brought to the attention of the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
provincial board of can­vassers by NP representative <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Aldemita</span> who, in a letter dated <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1969</st1:date>, asked the said
board of canvas­sers to return the election return to the board of inspectors
for correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously in anticipation of any
judicial action that the NPs might pertinently take, the peti­tioner's counsel
forthwith wrote the executive judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and all the judges of the branches there­of, requesting
that "we be informed" of any action that "Atty. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> may file . . . in connection with the election re­turns
from the third congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 17, 1969 the board of election inspectors (composed
of <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Alesna</span>, chairman,
<span class="SpellE">Gerarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Nadela</span>, poll clerk,
Susana <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span>, LP inspector, and Faustino de la <span class="SpellE">Cer­na</span>, NP inspector), in a <u>unanimous</u> sworn
petition, asked the court for authority to "complete the entries of all
the copies of the election return of Election Precinct No. 33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, by writing thereon
the name of candidate for <span style="">congressman </span>Eduar­do
<span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> and the sixty-seven (67) votes he obtained in
said pre­cinct, in words and figures, on the space in the election return
provided for this purpose," explaining that their failure to do so was
"through honest mistake and inadvertence due to mental and physical
fatigue and exhaustion." On <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1969</st1:date>, after a summary and <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
hearing, the court granted the petition; and so at the meeting of the provincial
board of canvassers on <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="11">November 20,
 1969</st1:date>, the chairman of the board of inspectors, over the objection
of the petitioner's counsel, made the correc­tion on the election return.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition, which
in essence imputes to the respondent judge grave abuse of discre­tion in
issuing the order in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's thesis is that although under section 154 of the
Revised Election Code a petition for correction may be heard <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, the respondent judge nevertheless should have
notified him of the hearing after he had requested to be informed of any action
that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> might bring; that under
section 154 a petition may be heard summarily and <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
only if the members of the board of inspectors are unanimously agreed on the
existence of an error - which does not obtain here as the signature of LP
inspector <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span> on the petition was procured
through "fraud and intimidation," which <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span>
herself de­nounced in her affidavit of November 21, 1969; that at any rate
under section 154 the court may only authorize, but not order, the correction
of errors in the election return.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answers, the respondents deny and traverse the
petitioner's allegations, and contend that, contrary to her later statement of <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1969</st1:date>, LP inspector <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span> volun­tarily signed the petition for
correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argue that, in line
with the decisions of this Court, the respondent judge correctly and properly
held a summary and <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> proceeding,
not being bound to give notice to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stress that the peti­tioner's
letter-request to the court referred to any action that "Atty. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> may file" and not to one that might be filed
"by any party," and that as the petition filed in the lower court was
in fact brought not by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> but by
the board of inspectors, the respondent judge was not duty bound to notify the
petitioner thereof, especially in view of the urgent na­ture of the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents aver that the number
of votes credited to the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> is
confirmed by the number of votes credited to him in the tally sheet and the
tally board, and that, as found by the provincial board of canvassers <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> polled a total of 17,498 votes, against the petitioner's
total of 17,482 votes, winning by a plurality of 16 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view that the present petition must be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action for correction of errors in election returns
authorized by section 154<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Revised Election Code is a <u>sum</u>­<u>mary</u> one, having in view
the limited time, before proclamation, within which the court must act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the petition for autho­rity to
correct may be entertained and granted only if it is made upon the <u>unanimous</u>
petition of the members of the board of inspec­tors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For when the members do not agree on the
existence of an error, the matter becomes contentious, necessitating a
full-dress hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court has said, "From the moment that the ins­pectors or any of
them do [<u>sic</u>] not agree with the corrections of the returns, the case
becomes contentious and, as such, requires the presentation of evidence in
order that the court may deter­mine on what ground to grant or not grant
authority to amend the returns in question.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> vehemently argues
that the peti­tion for correction, made under the authority of section 154,
should not have been heard and resolved without notice to him, especially in
view of the fact that he explicitly asked by letter to be informed of any
action that Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> might file in connection
with the election returns from the third congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and, further, because the correction sought to be made
would materially affect the result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a similar contention made in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gumpal</u></span><u> vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled that section 154 "does not require notice to the
candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of such
requirement be­comes significant when contrasted with the last sentence of sec­tion
163 specifically directing that notice of the proceeding for the recounting of
votes be given to all candidates affected." This Court went on to say,
"it is true that, as stated by the petitioner herein, 'the summary nature
of the proceeding under section 154 does not preclude notice to other affected
candidates as the alte­ration or amendment sought to be made would materially
affect the election.' Indeed it would be a good practice to require such notice
in appropriate cases, particularly when there is sufficient time <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and there are circumstances indicating that the al­legations
of the petition for correction may not be entirely truth­ful." We may
perhaps add that in this case before us, due pro­cess, the community's sense of
fairness, would seem to indicate the need of hearing the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span>, consistently with the <u>summary</u> character of
the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the respondent
judge might have accommodated the petitioner's request, considering that the
latter's residence is only a stone's throw from the court­house.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, paraphrasing the language of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Gumpal</u></span>, all indications pointed to the veracity of
the unanimous peti­tion filed in the present case by the board of election
inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, (a) the petition was
unanimously subscribed and sworn to:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by
the chairman, the poll clerk, the LP inspector and the NP ins­pector; (b) the
petition was corroborated by the "advance election returns" duly
signed by the said four members of the board of inspectors and transmitted to
the COMELEC-OQC tabulation cen­ter on election night as required by the
COMELEC; (c) the num­ber of votes sought to be credited to the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> was corroborated as well by the tally board, an
official COMELEC form; (d) the petition was substantiated by the testimony in <span style="">court of </span>the chairman and poll clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> does not deny that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> was a candidate; the omission from the election
return of mention of the latter's name and of the votes that he garnered, was
there­fore a patent mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does
the petitioner categorically deny that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>
obtained 67 votes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all he candidly says
is that he does not really know how many votes <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>
got.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does he asseverate that <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> obtained much less than 67, as would materially
affect the result of the election.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, we are not prepared to say that the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> was denied due process by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
when no notice was given to him of the petition for correction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above observations notwithstanding, and assuming <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">argumenti</span></u>
that the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> was "entitled"
to be heard in the proceeding before the court below, it bears empha­sis that
even after the lapse of more than 25 days - from the time the elections were
held on November 11 to the time he filed his memorandum in this case on
December 8 - the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> still has failed
to demonstrate that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> obtained a
number of votes much less <span style="">than </span>the
67 that were credited to the latter in precinct 33 as would materially affect
the result of the election.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the petitioner claims that the signature of <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span>, the LP inspector, on the petition for
correction was procured through fraud and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Put this is squarely <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by the affidavit of the COMELEC registrar of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>
and by the other members of the board of inspectors; thus belied is the
petitioner's claim that <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span> is an unread per­son
who was made or compelled to sign a petition that she did not understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the petitioner appears to be unsure of
his claim, as, in point of fact, at the oral argument on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1969</st1:date> before this Court he practically
disowned <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span>, pre­sumably in an effort to
discredit her, by asserting that she was not the person whom he had appointed
as LP inspector for pre­cinct 33.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied, on the basis of the foregoing <span class="GramE">disquisi­tion, that</span> the respondent court acted with
jurisdiction and in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under section 154, unanimity need only exist upon the filing of the
petition or before the court issues the order of correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, any change of heart or mind on
the part of any of the members of the board of inspectors, no matter how well
or badly motivated it may be, can have no effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise any one of the inspectors could with
facility trifle with <span style="">the law, and the
court would be going through the motions of a use­less and meaningless act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Javier vs. Court of
First Instance of Antiques</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> does not sus­tain the petitioner's
thesis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case one inspector never
joined the petition filed with the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that he had joined earlier similar petitions filed with the
municipal treasurer and the board of canvassers, but these two bodies obviously
could not lawfully act thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
judicial petition was filed, the inspector did not sign it; on the contrary, he
opposed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore the court never
acquired jurisdiction under section 154.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case before us, the facts are widely disparate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The LP inspector <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span>,
with all the other inspectors, signed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never disowned or </span>withdrew her
signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even now she does not deny
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her recantation - an obvious
afterthought - came only <u>after</u> the petition had been decided and the
correction had been made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Broad perspectives of public policy impose upon courts the
imperative duty to ascertain by all means within their command who is the real
candidate elected, but always in as expeditious a manner as possible, without
being fettered by technicalities and procedural barriers.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the petitioner and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> swap charges of terrorism and vote-buying in the
election adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say
that the present petition is not the proper remedy, nor is this Court the
proper forum for the ventilation of these charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the petitioner has not fashioned out a case that per­force
would compel this Court's intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is dismissed and the writs
prayed for are denied; as a logical consequence, the petitioner's prayer that
the proclamation of the respondent Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> as
the duly elected representative of the third congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> made by the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> provincial
board of canvassers on No­vember 27, 1969 be declared null and void, is hereby
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J</i>.: <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the dismissal of the petition in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are correctly stated in the main opinion of Mr. Justice
Castro.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that in the light of said facts, the crux of petitioner's
case is in the legal significance of his letter, Annex G-3, Petition, addressed
to and received by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> before the filing and hearing
of the joint petition for correction here in question whereby a request was
made that petitioner be notified of the "act­ion (which Atty. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>) may file - in connection with the election returns
from the third congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> which
will soon be canvassed by the Provincial Board of Canvassers - so that we can
be present during the raffling."</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, I cannot agree to the idea of sub­jecting such
letter to a strict literal interpretation of its words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question in my mind that what
petitioner intended to convey thereby was simply that he wanted to be heard
before the court should act on any proceeding of whatever nature Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> or any party, on his behalf or in furtherance of his
interests, may file in connection with the election returns to be uti­lized in
the canvass of the election returns of the third congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any reasonable
man in the place of respondent judge should have understood such letter as
sufficiently comprehensive to include the peti­tion here in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The central thought contained therein is that
a judicial step affecting the returns of the third district may be filed with
the court and petitioner was asking to be notified thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, petitioner could not
be expected to spe­cify the particular nature of the remedy, and the request to
be notified necessarily implies <span style="">a </span>desire to be heard not only in regard to
the raffling of the petition, which is secondary, but also as to the merits of
any such re­medy Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> might initiate, which
is more decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, I
would like to emphasize that in his answer respondent judge does not deny,
hence he admits, that he received the above letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he denies to have received is a specific
request that petitioner be notified of "the hearing of the petition for
correction of the entry of the return in Precinct No. 33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>,
Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>," which no one has alleged, and
so, I would even say that in a sense this denial could mislead the court, for
it gives the impression that respondent judge did not receive the subject
letter when that is not exactly what is intended to be conveyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if this were not an election case,
this manner of making a denial should deserve stronger stricture.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, however, I do not believe that the failure of
the court to notify petitioner of the hear­ing of the petition in question
constitutes a denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have no hesitation in holding that where a party is entitled to notice of a
proceeding by express mandate of the law, failure to notify him renders the pro­ceeding
held without hearing him null and void, irrespect­ive of whether or not such
party shows merit in his basic claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where, however, the opportunity to be heard is not prescribed by any law
or rule of court, and the matter be­fore the court is not contentious in nature,
it is incumbent upon the party concerned, if he wants the court to give him <span style="">a </span>chance to be heard, to show first
on the face of his pleading that if he is not heard, he may be de­prived of a
favorable result, and where there is no such showing, the court is fully
justified in denying the request for notice and hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein may be found, precisely, what to my mind is the difference
in their elements between procedural and substantive due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first, there is denial of due process
when notice and hearing expressly required by law are not accorded,
irrespective of the merits of the party's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter, hearing is not indis­pensable
when there is no showing that the results would be possibly or probably
favorable, if the party were to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first, the hearing is a mandate that cannot be ignored only
because the law specifically re­quires it and not necessarily because the party
has an apparent right of which he would be denied without being heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter, the duty to hear is imposed
more by a sporting sense of fair play rather than by any sta­tute or rule of
court, hence it is but logical and pro­per that before the court grants a
hearing, it should be informed of the nature of the right <span class="SpellE">imperilled</span>,
and if no such showing appears, no unfairness can be said to be<span style=""> </span>involved,
since there is no apparent deprivation of any right that can take place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>other
words, it <span style="">is my</span> con­sidered view
that the essence of substantive due process is not in the need for a hearing
for the mere <span style="">sake
</span>of a hearing, but rather the possibility of a substantive right being
denied to a party without such party having had an opportunity to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How is the court to know that
there <span style="">is </span>a
right to be lost and that the hearing requested will not amount to an empty
formality, un­less it is informed in the pleadings as to the nature of such
right?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, a party cannot
just come to court and demand that he be heard; he must first tell the court
that he has something else substantial, aside from the chance of being heard,
of which he may be de­prived unless he is heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying these views to the present case, I hold that inasmuch as
under Section 154 of the Revised Elect­ion Code, it is already settled that
none of the candi­dates has any right to notice of the hearing of a unani­mous
petition for correction of an election return filed unanimously by the members
of the board of inspectors of the corresponding precinct, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>was under no compulsion, whether
legal, moral or equitable, to call pe­titioner to the hearing of the petition
in question not­withstanding his letter, Annex G-3, no matter how libe­rally <span style="">We </span>may
construe the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner himself ad­mits,
and rightly, that he is not entitled to notice as a matter of statutory and
jurisprudential right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He bases his
claim to due process only on his having ex­pressly requested the court for a
chance to be heard thru <span style="">his letter,
Annex G-3, and as a matter of fairness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such being the case, it was imperative for him to inform the court of
what right he stood to lose and the basis of his claim to such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, petitioner did not do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most his letter can amount to <span style="">is </span>that of a demand to be heard in
regard to any remedy affecting the returns in the third congressional district
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is nothing in said letter to indicate what right petitioner stood to lose, if
he were heard; much less </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">there
any allegation therein of the basis of any such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of this nature, the general </span>requirement
<span style="">would be </span>for the petitioner to
state under oath that he would be <span style="">able
to prove that the correction requested was not in accordance with the facts
because in truth Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> got less votes than
what is alleged in the petition and </span>that the <span style="">votes he actually got would not alter the ap­parent result of the count
</span>favorable <span style="">to herein
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These things cannot be </span>presumed,
precisely because it is <span style="">entirely
possible, and it is more likely than not, that the electoral proceedings are
being merely delayed for one reason or another not </span>related to public
interest but, <span style="">rather, to the
unsportsmanlike inability of a loser to </span>immediately accept defeat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it was not enough to claim a right to
be present in the "raffling" of the case for assignment among the
different judges of the court as indicated in Section 7 of Rule 22 of the Rules
of Court, <span class="GramE">specially</span> because said provision of the
Rules, by its very nature, cannot apply to election cases and incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, a request to be present in the raf­fling
does not necessarily imply a desire to be heard be­cause one has a right to be
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most that it means <span style="">is </span>that one wants an assurance that
there would be no ir­regularity in the selection of the judge to be assigned to
handle the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot buy petitioner's pretense that he did not know and had
no means of knowing the number of votes Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>
got in Precinct 33 in <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> at the time he filed the petition in the
court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the closeness
of the contest between petitioner and <span style="">respond­ent
<span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>, </span>We would be utterly naive, if <span class="GramE">We</span><span style=""> </span>were to be­lieve that petitioner had no reliable information
regarding such matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, if he did not know on what ground he stood <span class="SpellE"><span style="">vis</span>-a-vis</span> Precinct 33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, what right could he have to ask the court for a
hearing?</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner admits that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> had
some votes in said precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely,
under Section 150 of the Revised Election Code, therefore, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> was <span class="SpellE">entitiled</span> to have
those votes duly entered in the election return for that precinct, and there
can be no doubt that the proper procedure for th<span style="">is</span> is that provided for in Section
154.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In American jurisprudence, a
mandamus is available under these circumstances (The Revised Elect­ion Code by
V. Francisco, 1965 ed., p. 497), but our le­gislature did not see it fit to
adopt that remedy here, and it <span style="">is </span>to be presumed that the intention <span style="">is </span>to allow
the parties concerned to avail of Section 154, the lan­guage of said provision
being broad enough to reasonably comprehend such <span style="">a </span>situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reject the <span style="">premise </span>that there is no remedy within
the existing provisions of the Revised Election Code for a contingency like
this, if only because this is not a very uncommon occurrence and Congress
cannot be presumed to have been ignorant thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a mere erroneous entry of the number of
votes of a candidate can be altered in order to state the correct or true one,
with much more reason should such altera­tion be permitted when it <span style="">is </span>publicly
known that a cer­tain person is a candidate and that he received votes and yet
the return does not even contain his name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe that to show on the return that a candidate <span style="">has </span>received
votes <span style="">is </span>equally,
if not even more, compelling than to enter his correct number of votes thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Viewing petitioner's cause from another angle, the question may
be asked, if this case is remanded to the lower court in order that petitioner
may be given a hearing, what ground or fact can he show there to defeat the
petition, which <span style="">is </span>not yet known
to be inconsequential or unavailing?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's belated allegation made for the first time in this Court,
that the name of Susana <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span> who appears to
have signed the unanimous petition, as the Liberal Party Inspector in Precinct
33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, is not included in the list of official
inspectors proposed by him, thereby suggest­ing possible unauthorized
substitution, cannot stand closer scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To start with, in his own sworn petition in this case, petitioner states
categorically that <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span> is <span style="">the "LP Inspector" in said precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Par. 7, p. 3, Petition) This </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">a judicial admission which, as a rule, peti</span>tioner
<span style="">is </span>not
allowed to contradict (<span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>,
80 Phil. 227).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only when judicial
admissions are "made improvidently and by mistake, and the improvidence and
mis­take (is) be clearly shown, (that) the court is vested with discretion to
relieve (the party making the admission) from their consequences, a discretion
which should be exercised sparingly and cautiously".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(5 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, p.
58) Obviously, herein petitioner's case does not come within the
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's verbal <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> allegation at the oral argument is far from being a
clear showing of his alleged mistake, and in the memorandum sub­mitted after
the hearing, no mention whatever is made of this point; much <span style="">less </span>is any
convincing evidence submitted regarding it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, in her own affidavit attached to the petition, <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span> swore that she was an inspector in Precinct 33.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, examining closely <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan's</span>
affidavit, I find nothing <span style="">in </span>it
which can overthrow the solemn testimonies given to the court <u>a</u> <u>qu</u><u><span style="">o</span></u><span style=""> </span>by the chairman of the board of inspectors and the poll clerk
of Precinct 33, both of them being public school teachers, to the effect that Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> actually got 67 votes in said precinct, as evi­denced
additionally by the tally <span style="">sheet </span>and advance election results duly signed by <span class="SpellE">Satinitigan</span>, who has not disowned her signatures thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Still further, inasmuch
as the court below issued </span>its order in question on November 20, 1969
yet, petitioner had all the opportunity to file <span style="">a </span>motion for reopening in that court,
if indeed he had enough evidence in his hands to prove that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> did not receive 67 votes in the disputed
precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth <span style="">is </span>that he had no such evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he has not been able to indicate any
such evidence even here in this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What <span style="">is
</span>worse, he cannot, at least, honestly allege <span style="">that </span>the true number of votes Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>
got <span style="">in </span>said
precinct cannot affect the appar­ent lead petitioner had over him before the
correction or­dered by the lower court was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circum­stances, I am at a loss to
see what substantial justice <span class="GramE">could petitioner</span> be
deprived of if his present petition is denied by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mention was also made during the hearing of this case before <span class="GramE">Us</span> of the desirability, perhaps, of opening the bal­lot box
of Precinct 33 and counting the ballots therein, thereby settling once and for
all any doubts that may be entertained as to the true number of votes of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
must express with all vehemence my objection to such a procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">This <span style="">is </span>not an electoral protest wherein the ballots are the best
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is involved in this
proceed­ing <span style="">is
</span>only a preliminary procedure leading to the procla­mation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation is essentially <span style="">a </span>presumptive
act; it has never been intended to be a final title to the of­fice for which an
election <span style="">is </span>held,
unless <span style="">it is </span>uncontest­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The series of proceedings elaborately
outlined in the election law have been designed <span style="">in </span>order to meet the impe­rative
demand of public interest and orderly administration of public affairs that as
soon as possible, before the term of the office involved begins, one of the
candidates may be considered as having been elected and thereby assume the
functions thereof, without prejudice to any protest the other candidates may
file later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, such scheme
outlined in the law suffices to prevent proclamation "grab­bers" from
trampling with the popular will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I, for
one, feel very strongly that the courts can always plug the loopholes which
unscrupulous candidates and lawyers often take advantage of to circumvent the
clearly discernible in­tent of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that is needed is for the judiciary to be more active in dealing
with clear cases of attempts to make a mockery of the popular suffrage, the
very found­ation of the republican nature of our government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise, even the judiciary can be blamed
for the tendency, which <span style="">is </span>becoming more and more apparent, of
the electoral process deteriorating into <span style="">a
</span>game for opportunists and schemers.</p>

<p class="BODY">I consider the pragmatic approach suggested as pregnant with dire
consequences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let alone the fact that if
this Court sanctions here the opening of the ballot box, We will hardly be able
to deny a similar request in all other cases where the pragmatic theory will <span class="GramE">necessarily</span> be invoked; consider only that if the counting
of the ballots is allowed today, next time, in pursuance of the same pragmatic
reasoning, the appreciation of the ballots can al­ready be demanded before the
canvass, thereby eliminating altogether the necessity of an electoral
protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it <span style="">is </span>that the ballots are the primary evidence of the will of the
electorate, but, at the same time, the very sanctity of the ballots makes it
naturally logical that they be considered as the last resort, and this should
be in the protest already and not before the canvass which must be based, as
already observed, on some reasonable pre­sumptive means required by the imperativeness
of having a proclamation within the short time there <span style="">is </span>between the date of election and the beginning of the term of
office of those elected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I
cannot favor the adoption, at any stage before the proclamation, of any
procedure which <span style="">is </span>proper only
in an electoral contest, for that would be undermining the whole studied system
of electoral proceedings envisioned in the Revised Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the considerations that compel me to vote against the
granting of the petition in this case.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">Dissenting Opinion</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DIZON, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">Much to my regret, I am constrained to dissent from the majority
opinion penned by Mr. Justice Castro.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pertinent facts, as stated therein, are the follow­ing:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a petition for <u>certiorari</u> and prohibition to annul
the order dated Novem­ber 18, 1969 of the respondent Judge Alfredo C. Laya of
the Court of First Instance of Cebu (Branch II and Branch XII), authorizing the
board of election inspectors of precinct 33 of the municipality of Carcar,
province of Cebu, ‘to complete and/or correct' the election return they had
prepared, by (a) including in the said return the name of Eduardo Gullas, one
of the candidates for representative of the third congressional district of
Cebu, and (b) crediting him with sixty-seven (67) votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court issued the order on the basis of
the sworn testimony of the poll chairman and poll clerk, together with the
unanimous written sworn petition of the members of the board alleging that
because of 'fatigue and exhaus­tion' they had inadvertently failed to write the
name of candidate Gullas and the number of votes he received, which is and
should be 67 as evidenced by the tally sheet, tally board and advance copies of
the election return.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the elections held on November 11, 1969 in the third
congressional district of <span style="">Cebu, the
petitioner Antonio V. Cuenco of the Liberal Party and the respondent Eduardo
Gullas of the Nacionalista Party were among the candidates for
congressman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election return for
precinct 33 in Carcar recites that the petitioner Cuenco obtained 61 votes but
made no mention of the name of Gullas nor the number of votes cast for
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This omission was brought to </span>the
attention of <span style="">the Cebu pro­vincial board
of canvassers by NP representa­</span>tive Abundio A. Aldemita, who, in a
letter <span style="">dated November 13, 1969, asked
the said board of canvassers to return </span>the election <span style="">return to the board of inspectors for
correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously in anticipation </span>of any
judicial action that the NPs might per­<span style="">tinently
</span>take, the petitioner's counsel forth­<span style="">with wrote the executive judge of </span>the Court of First Instance of
Cebu and all the judges of <span style="">the branches
thereof, </span>requesting that 'we be <span style="">informed'
of any action that 'Atty. Eduardo Gullas may file . . . in connection with the </span><span style="">election returns from </span>the <span style="">third congressional </span>district of Cebu.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 17, 1969 the board of election inspectors
(composed of Ignacio Alesna, chairman, Gerarda Nadela, poll clerk, Susana
Satinitigan, LP inspector, and Faustino de la Cerna, NP inspector), in a <u>unanimous</u>
sworn petition, asked the court for authority to 'complete the entries of all
the copies of the election return of Election Precinct No. 33 of Carcar, Cebu,
by writing thereon the name of candidate for con­gressman Eduardo Gullas and
the sixty-seven (67) votes he obtained in said precinct, in words and figures,
on the space in the election return pro­vided for this purpose,' explaining
that their failure to do so was 'through honest mistake and inadvertence due to
mental and physical fatigue and exhaustion.' On November 18, 1969, after <span style="">a </span>summary
and <u><span style="">ex </span>parte</u> hearing, the
court granted the petition; and so at the meeting of the provincial board of
canvassers on November 20, 1969, the chairman of the board of inspectors, over
the objection of the petitioner's counsel, made the correction on the <span style="">election return.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"Hence
this petition for <u>certiorari</u> </span>and pro­<span style="">hibition, which in <span style="">essence
imputes to the </span></span>respondent <span style="">judge
grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order in question."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This dissent is based firstly, upon the ground that the Urgent
Petition filed on November 17, 1969 with the branch of the Court of First
Instance of Cebu presided by the respondent judge, by the Board of Election
Inspectors of Election Precinct No. 33 of Carcar, Cebu, praying that said Board
be authorized "to complete the entries of all the copies of the election
return of Election Precinct No. 33 of Carcar, Cebu, by writing thereon the name
of candidate for congressman Eduardo Gullas and the sixty?seven (67)
votes he obtained in said precinct, in words and figures, on the space in the
election return provided for this purpose", does not fall within the
purview of the provisions of Section 154 of the Revised Election Code; and
secondly, upon the further ground that, assuming, arguendo, that the said
Urgent Petition falls within the purview of said legal provision, the
respondent judge, upon the undisputed facts of the case, acted with grave abuse
of discretion in considering it <u>ex-parte</u> and in issuing his order of
November 18, 1969 authorizing the Board of Election Inspectors of Precinct 33
of Carcar, Cebu, "to complete and/or correct" the election return
they had prepared for the precinct aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 154 of the Revised Election Code is of the following
tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"Alterations in the statement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- After the announcement of the result of the election in the polling
place, the board of inspectors shall not make any alteration or amendment in
any of its statements, unless it be so ordered by a competent court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We might begin by
assuming, for the purposes of this dissent, that </span>the terms <u>alteration</u>
and <u>amendment</u> <span style="">mean the </span>same
thing, and that the term "alteration", just like the term
"amendment" means - legally speaking - to add, change, substitute or
omit something from a pleading or instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In plain words, a pleading or instrument may be amended either by
correcting or by omitting any word, phrase or sentence set forth therein, or by
<u>adding</u> something to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
last instance we have the case of an amendment by addition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, what exactly does Section 154 of the Revised Election Code
authorize?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, I believe, is vital and
decisive of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is plain even
from a cursory reading of its provisions that the <u>alteration</u> or <u>amendment</u>
it authorizes is to be made <u>not </u><u><span style="">in
the </span>election return</u> but <span style="">"in
</span>any of its statements".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
election return is one thing and "any of its statements" is clearly
something else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the legal provision
in question were to refer to the alteration or amendment of the <u>election
return</u> itself, without any qualification, there could arise no question at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cold fact, however, is that it
authorizes nothing more than <span style="">the </span>alteration
or amendment of "any of its statements".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof I ask:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is there, in the election return for Election
Precinct No. 33 of Carcar, any "state­ment" concerning <u>Eduardo
Gullas and the number of </u><u><span style="">votes
polled by him</span></u><span style=""> </span>in the
last general election that could be <u>altered</u> or <u>amended</u>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was precisely for this reason, I presume,
that the Board of Inspectors of Precinct 33 asked for authority to
"complete" and the respondent judge autho­rized said Board of
Inspectors to <u><span style="">comple</span></u><u><span style="">t</span></u><u><span style="">e</span></u><span style=""> </span>the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no clearer
admission than this of the fact that the election return in question contains
no statement regarding Eduardo Gullas and the number of votes allegedly cast in
his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems clear from the foregoing that what the Board of Election
Inspectors wanted, and was authorized to do by the respondent judge, is to set
forth in the aforesaid election return a statement that did not exist there
before, and not merely to alter or amend a <u>statement</u> already made
therein concerning Eduardo Gullas <span style="">and </span>the
number of votes cast in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This,
I believe, is not within the purview of the legal provision under con­sideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the conclusion must be that the
Court presided by the respondent judge had no jurisdiction over the Urgent
Petition filed by the Board of Inspectors of Precinct No. 33 of Carcar, Cebu,
or, at the very least, His Honor had no authority to consider it as a summary
proceeding under the provisions of Section 154 of the Revised Election
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, it should have con­sidered
it as an unnamed contentious special proceeding, notice of which should have
been served on all the parties to be affected by the relief sought.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two important considerations lead me to this con­clusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is the fact that in taking cognizance of
any election case or a proceeding affecting elections Courts of First Instance
exercise <u>limited</u> jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This limited jurisdiction should not be unduly enlarged, for this would
be contrary to the purpose of the law granting the limited jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second is that the cases for <u>correction</u>
of election returns <span style="">should </span>not <span style="">be unnecessarily multiplied but must be
limited </span>strictly <span style="">to the cases
clearly provided in Section 154 of the Re­</span>vised Election Code, lest we
enable the <span style="">members of Boards of
Inspectors to be the final arbiters of election con­</span>tests by conspiring
unanimously to <u><span style="">correct</span></u><span style="">, with leave of court, election returns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">(2) Assuming, however,
for the sake of argument, that the urgent petition </span>mentioned heretofore
falls <span style="">within the purview of Section 154
of the Revised Election </span>Code, it is my opinion that, upon the facts set
forth above, the respondent judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in
considering it ex-parte and in issuing the order complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that, prior to the filing of said urgent petition,
petitioner Antonio V. Cuenco, through counsel, "wrote the executive judge
of the Court of First Instance of Cebu and all the judges of the branches there­of"
(majority opinion) requesting that he be informed of any action that
"Atty. Gullas may file … in connection with the election returns from the
third congressional district of Cebu" (Idem).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now contended that, because petitioner's letter-request
refer to any action filed by Atty. Eduardo Gullas, the respondent judge had
every right to ignore his request because the urgent petition was filed not by
Gullas but by the Board of Inspectors of Election Precinct No. 33 of
Carcar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, I submit, is without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The res­pondent judge, who, as
such, is supposed to be of mature judgment, was bound to construe petitioner's
letter-request as meaning and referring to any action or proceeding com­menced
by Gullas or by any other party, in connection with the election returns from
the third congressional district of Cebu.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mental honesty on his part demanded this.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the respondent judge likewise <span style="">knew or was supposed to know </span>that, as
stated in the majority <span style="">opinion, notice
could have been easily served by the Court upon petitioner whose residence </span><span style="">"is </span>only
a <span style="">stone's throw from the
courthouse".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, His Honor,
chose to ignore this fact, just as he ignored the written request of peti­</span>tioner
for an <span style="">opportunity to </span>be heard
before any action was <span style="">taken on any
judicial action or proceeding in his court materially affecting the elections </span>held
in the <span style="">third congressional district of
Cebu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the </span>majority
opinion that "broad perspectives of public policy impose upon courts the
imperative duty to ascertain who is the real candidate elected, in as
expeditious a manner as possible, without being fettered by technicalities and
procedural barriers", but I also submit that equally broad and imperative
pers­pectives of public policy demand that <span style="">the courts should do so with fairness and understanding, and without
taking any precipitous action - violative of due process - that might give rise
to suspicions of bias.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Much </span>is made in
the majority opinion of the fact that petitioner dared not deny categorically
during the oral argument before this court that Gullas obtained sixty-seven
(67) votes, nor assert that Gullas <span style="">obtained
much less than sixty-seven (67) votes; that all that he candidly admitted was
that "he does not really know how many votes Gullas got".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This position is perfectly under­standable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why expect him to prove his opponent's case,
or supply what the members of the Board of Inspectors say they <u>forgot</u></span>
to write on the return allegedly because they were sleepy or otherwise
physically exhausted?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
petitioner's candidness and sincerity being taken against him, it should be
considered as an unmistakable sign of his good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, even admitting, arguendo, that the proceeding had before
the respondent judge falls within the provisions <span style="">of Section 154 of the Revised Election Code and that, there­fore, it was
discretionary with His Honor to make it summary or give notice to petitioner
Cuenco before taking any action therein, I say </span>that such discretion must
always be deemed to be <u>sound judicial discretion</u> and that, in the
present case, it was not so exercised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I, </span>therefore, vote
to grant the writs prayed for, with the result that the order complained <span style="">of is hereby set aside, and the respondent
judge is </span>ordered to re-open the case, serving due notice of the
proceeding upon petitioner herein and other parties who might be adversely
affected by the relief sought by the Board of Election Inspectors of Precinct 33
of Carcar, Cebu.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">Dissenting Opinion</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ZALDIVAR, <i>J</i>.: </p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> that "upon the facts set forth above (in his
dissenting opinion), the respondent judge committed a grave abuse of discre­tion
in considering it (the petition) <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
and in issuing the order complained of." After reading the record I cannot
help but get the impression that respond­ent Judge denied petitioner Antonio V.
<span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> <span style="">a </span>chance to present his side regarding the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> election return of precinct 33 of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Carcar</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the correction of an election return,
under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code, may proceed <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>it would only be in consonance with
fairness and sound discretion had respondent Judge given petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> notice of the filing of the petition so he could
take the steps that he considered necessary for the protection of his rights
and interests, because this was precisely what he intended to do when he wrote
the letter requesting respondent Judge to inform him of any action that Atty.
Eduardo <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gullas</span></span><span style=""> </span>would file "in con­nection with the election returns from
the third congres­sional district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> which will
soon be canvassed by the Provincial Board of Canvassers."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, it would only be in consonance with fairness and sound discretion if
respondent judge afforded petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> a chance
to be present at the hearing on the petition when he took the testimonies of
the chairman and the poll clerk <span style="">of the </span>board of inspectors of precinct 33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, and in re<span style="">ceiving
the </span><span style="">only
documentary evidence consisting of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">copy of the alleged
advance election results</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had peti</span><span style="">tioner <span class="SpellE">Cuenco</span> been given notice of the filing
of the petition, and of the hearing on the petition, he could </span>have
ascertained whether the election inspector repr<span style="">esenting his party had knowingly joined the petition for correction of
the election return in question; h</span><span style="">e
</span><span style="">could have cross-examined the
two witnesses, to test their credibility and to determine the correctness of </span><span style="">their </span><span style="">statements; and he could have had a chance to
show whether the alleged copy of the advance election results was genuine or
not, or whether the statements contained therein were accurate or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have taken </span>note of the fact, <span style="">as </span>gathered
from the order of res­<span style="">pondent Judge,
complained of, that he mainly based his order on the testimonies of the
chairman and the poll clerk of the board of election inspectors, and on the </span>alleged
copy of the advance election results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
<span style="">strikes </span>me that while <span style="">the two witnesses made </span>mention of the
tally board in precinct <span style="">33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, said </span><span style="">tally board </span><span style="">was not presented at all during the
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tally board </span>is <span style="">a </span>document
that was not placed inside the ballot box after the canvass of the votes, but
was del<span style="">ivered to the municipal treasurer
of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record shows that the hearing on the petition for correction </span>was held in
the very <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Carcar</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and respondent Judge
could have asked for the <span style="">tally board to
</span>find out if candidate Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> had
obtained votes in precinct 33 of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I consider the tally <span style="">board a very vital piece of evidence which </span><span style="">should </span><span style="">have been examined </span>by
respondent Judge, especially because the pro­ceeding was held <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The tally board could easily be
tampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein <span style="">respondents </span>have attached a
photographic copy of the tally board in their answers to the petition before
this <span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But according to </span>counsel for the
respondents who argued the case before this Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="12">December 4, <span style="">1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, the photograph of the tally board </span>was
taken only on <st1:date year="1969" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> </u>hearing
before respondent Judge took place on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="11">November
 18, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That tally board
was in the possession <span style="">of </span>the
municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> and was available for
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whoever was, or were,
interested in the correction of the election return -- by adding therein the
name of candidate <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span> and the votes he obtained --
could, and should, have brought that tally board before the respond­ent
Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or the respondent Judge should
have asked for the tally <span style="">board after hearing </span>the chairman and the poll clerk make reference
<span style="">to </span>it
in their testi­monies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is, </span>therefore,
my view that respondent Judge abused his discretion when he failed to give
petitioner a <span style="">chance to be heard regarding
the petition for correction, and that respondent Judge had not acted </span><span style="">with due dili­</span><span style="">gence when he issued the order in question
