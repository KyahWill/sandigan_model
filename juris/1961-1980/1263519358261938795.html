decision of the Court of Appeals (Sixth Division), in its Case CA-G.</span> <span class="GramE">R. No. 32140-R, reversing the Judgment of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The background of the case can be gleaned from the following
findings in the appealed decision (Petition, Annex "A"):</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"After going over the records of Civil Case
No.</span> D-287, the following facts come to light:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Civil Case No. D-287 was insti­tuted by <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> against <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mamer­to</span>, Juanita, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span>, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, praying that she be declared the
sole heir of the deceased Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, and in the
alternative, should defendants’ rights prevail over the plaintiff's in the
succession to the estate of the aforementioned decedents, that said defendants
be ordered to execute a deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in favor
of plaintiff with respect to an undivided 1/3 portion of the properties enu­merated
in the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> and Juanita, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>
are the children of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, while defendants
<span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> are the
children of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="9">September
 21, 1956</st1:date>, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and defendants <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>
entered into an amicable settlement in Civil Case No. D-287, embodied in a
partial deci­sion of the same date, wherein plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> was given the one-fourth (1/4) share of lot
117, corresponding to and registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1957</st1:date>, plaintiff amended her complaint in Civil Case No. D-287,
wherein among other things she (a) included <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Arabe</span> as one of the defendants and alleged heirs of Ni­colas
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>; and (b) in her "Common to both Causes
of Action" she stated:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">That the plaintiff and the defendants, <span class="SpellE"><u>Baltazar</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span></u> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Gaudencia</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span></u>, had already submitted an amicable settle­ment,
regarding their respective claims and/or defenses, as recited in this com­plaint,
and which was copied in the original complaint, for which this Court, as shown
in the records, had already rendered a partial judgment; that, <u>consequently,
therefore, all that remains to be decided in the foregoing complaint relates to
the plaintiff's action solely against the defen­dants except<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the above-named <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Underscoring supplied)</u></p>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 5 July 1960, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and defendants <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arabe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and Juanita <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, entered into an agreement which was approved and
embodied in a deci­sion dated August 23, 1960, wherein <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> waived and quitclaimed all her claims to the
parcels of land subject of the litigation, among which is the one-fourth (1/4)
portion of Lot 117, in favor of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
defendants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1962</st1:date>, defendants filed an urgent petition dated <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1961</st1:date>, praying that a
supplemental order be issued holding that all plaintiff's claim in the seven
parcels of land described in said Civil Case D-287 have been completely waived
and quit­claimed in favor of <span class="GramE">defendants</span> assignee,
Atty. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this petition plaintiff filed an
opposition based principally on the grounds (a) that there is no necessity for
plaintiff to again execute another deed for the purpose of renouncing her
rights to the proper­ties thereto described; and (b) that it will modify the
judgment of August 23, 1960, in the sense that what is prayed for by defendants
in their petition will in fact operate to make plaintiff renounce not only the
1/4 portion litigated between them, but the other 1/4 portion liti­gated
between plaintiff and defendants <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, which has
already been the subject of a partial decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 19, 1962, the trial court issued an
order denying defendants' aforementioned petition of December 16, 1961, on the
ground that defendants seek a relief ‘which will have the effect of running
counter to, or modifying, the decision dated August 23, 1960, which has already
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.’"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, upon urgent petition of appellant <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>,
dated 21 May 1962, pointing out that in the compromise agreement of 23 August
1960 <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> not
only expressly included in her quitclaim a 1/4 undivided portion of Lot 117
(later Lot 117-C) of the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Cadastre (inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>) but she had in addition expressly authorized <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jarabe</span>, widow of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, "to sell any or all of the properties"
covered by the agreement conditioned upon payment to the <span class="SpellE">quitclaimer</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> of the sum of P3,000, which her son had later
received in her behalf, the Court of First Instance reversed its previous position,
and by order of 20 July 1962 declared petitioner <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>,
vendee of <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jarabe</span>
for and in behalf of herself and her children, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> and Juanita <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>,
entitled to the ownership of the entire Lot 117-C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court further ordered the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to issue the corresponding
certificate of title to Castaneda (Record on Appeal, pages 1 and 45, et
seq.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable to secure recon­sideration,
the children and heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>
resorted to the Court of Appeals, which (as already noted at the start of this
opinion) reversed the Court of First Instance, holding that the quitclaim and
authority to sell executed by <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> in 1960 could
not refer to the 1/4 portion of Lot 117 decreed in her favor by the partial de­cision
of 1960, since the latter had become final.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> in turn came to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In assessing the correctness of the decision of the Court of
Appeals, now under review, it is indispensable to bear in mind that there had
been two (2) distinct compromises in this case while it was in the Court of
First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was first the <st1:date year="1956" day="20" month="9">20 September 1956</st1:date> amicable settlement
between <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>
(predecessor of herein private respondents) on the one hand and on the other
the children of her brother <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> (<span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this
first compromise, <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> was adjudicated an
undivided 1/4 portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117 of the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Cadastre, while the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
were allotted an undivided 1/2 of the <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2984 of the
same survey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This settlement was
approved by the partial decision of <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="9">21
 September 1956</st1:date> (Record on Appeal, page 46; Order of 20 July
1962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that in this settlement the
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pastora's</span> other brother, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, did not intervene; they were not parties thereto,
and it did not affect them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why was <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> allocated only 1/4 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
117?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court order of <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="7">20 July 1962</st1:date> explains it (Record on
Appeal, pages 48-49).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot 117 had been
split into lots 117-A (which was a road), 117-B corresponding to Felipe F.
Fernandez (not a party to the case), and Lot 117-C corresponding to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> and Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>,
who, therefore, held 1/2 each of Lot 117-C, i.e., 1/4 each of the old Lot 117,
since half of the old Lot 117 (now Lot 117-B) already was owned by
Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1/4 al­located to <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> was thus the share of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117-C; the other 1/4 was the share of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
fractions (constituting the whole of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117-C) made up
1/2 of the old <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117 (excluding the road, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
117-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By accepting this 1/4 portion
from the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
virtually recognized that the other 1/4 corresponded to the heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And just as
the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> transferred all their interest
(1/4) in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117 to <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>,
she in turn agreed that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span> children should
have 1/2 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2984.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the implication is that the other half of this lot belonged to
the heirs of Nicolas, petitioner's pre­decessors in interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the second compromise dated <st1:date year="1960" day="5" month="7">5 July 1960</st1:date>, embodied in and approved by the trial
court's decision of <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="8">23 August 1960</st1:date>
(Record on Appeal, pages 6-12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this
settlement between <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> and the heirs of her
brother Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
quitclaimed and waived "now and forever", in favor of the heirs of
Nicolas, all her claims to the following parcels of land:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/3 of lot 833 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/2 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2984, do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/3 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 950, do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/3 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 971;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/4 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117
"under original transfer (sic) certificate of title No. <span class="GramE">4643,
.......</span> (T.C.T. No. 3962)" (Record on Appeal, page 10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1/3 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1267;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1046.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> not only renounced all her
claims to these lots; she went further, and stipulated that -</p>

<blockquote>"the widow of Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Jarabi</span> (sic) is
authorized to sell any or all the properties above described in this agreement
.......... for the amount she may be able to sell them, provided that out of
the proceeds of the sale, after paying the real estate taxes and inheritance
taxes, to pay THREE THOUSAND (P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) PESOS to the
plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>,
by way of consideration to the quitclaims above mentioned .................” <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, page 11).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, the compromise of 1960 involved not only a waiver of <span class="SpellE">Pastora's</span> claims over the lots, but an actual conveyance of
the properties enumerated to the heirs of Nicolas, represented by his widow,
since they were empowered to sell the quitclaimed portions of the lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they were in fact sold to petitioner
herein, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, by a deed of sale dated 5
April 1962 (Record on Appeal, pages 12-15), which purported to -</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">sell</span>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>transfer and convey all their rights,
interests, participation and shares and title as well as those pro­perties
quitclaimed in their favor by <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">the</span> vendee
undertaking to pay the latter P3,000.00 as agreed in the compromise of
1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this amount was actually paid
is not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question before <span class="GramE">Us</span> now is which 1/4
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117 was included in <span class="SpellE">Pastora's</span>
1960 quitclaim deed in favor of the heirs of her brother Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
(and their vendee, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>) urge that
the 1/4 quitclaimed by <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> is precisely the 1/4
she obtained from the successors of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pastora's</span> heirs (respondents in this Court) contend that it
was the other 1/4 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117 unaffected or not included
in her 1956 settlement with the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this last contention the Court of Appeals
sustained, arguing that <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> did not intend to
quitclaim and abandon the 1/4 allotted to her in the settlement and decision of
21 September 1956 because the decision of 23 August 1960 (approving the
quitclaim in favor of the heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>)
"mentions only one fourth (1/4) and not one half (1/2) of Lot 117.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the intention of <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> was to include the share of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, then they would
have so stated in their agreement for judgment".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>fail to see the
logic of this conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her
complaint <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>
only claimed <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of an undivided one-third
(1/3) of the properties held by her deceased brothers <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
and Nicolas, thus impliedly recognizing that her two brothers aforesaid owned
the other two-thirds (2/3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is dif­ficult
to understand how she could be expected to quitclaim one-half of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
of 117 in favor of the heirs of Nicolas, when that would be more than what in
her complaint she asserted to be her share (1/3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only share she could waive was precisely
the one-fourth (1/4) of original <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117 (which is 1/2
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 117-C) that she obtained by the 1956 settle­ment
with the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>,
as confirmed by the partial decision of <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="9">21
 September 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plainly, the
Court of Appeals allowed itself to be unduly impressed by the alleged finality
of the partial de­cision aforementioned, entirely oblivious of the fact that
this decision never became final as to Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>,
or the heirs of the latter, who did not participate in the settlement confirmed
by the partial de­cision aforesaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the agreement between <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
and the heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, quoted in the
decision of 23 August 1960, will show that <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span>
therein waived her claims to one-third (1/3) of the lots therein enumerated,
which is precisely the share she demanded in her initial complaint against her
brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only exceptions are <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
117 of the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Cadastre of which she renounced
1/4 and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2984 of which she waived one-half
(1/2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why this variation?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously it was due to the fact that by the
previous separate agreement with the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> had
already accepted 1/4 (not 1/3) of Lot 117 in exchange for 1/2 of Lot 2984
allocated to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span> children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in her agreement with the heirs of
Nicolas, she could only waive the fourth (1/4) of lot 117 that she obtained,
and the one-half of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1984 that was not allocated to
the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the plain import of the agreement was
that <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> was
renouncing all her original claims to the properties held by her brothers, in
exchange of the P3,000.00 stipulated, and which the heirs of Nicolas caused to
be paid to her through appellant <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, to whom
the former sold their respective rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> had by the compromise with the heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> divested herself in their favor of any claim to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
117.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the heirs of Nicolas
subsequently conveyed to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> their
original interest amounting to 1/4 of Lot 117 plus the 1/4 quitclaimed in their
favor by <span class="SpellE">Pastora</span> <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> became the owner of 1/2 of the
original Lot 117 of the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Cadastre (that is now
Lot 117-C thereof), as correctly held by the court of origin.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals
is reversed and set aside, and that of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> is reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp;
