				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to set aside a writ of preliminary 
injunction issued by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte in Civil Case 
No. 3434 thereof, entitled "Alfredo Cajigal, et al. vs. Agro-Industrial 
Products, Inc., et al."
<p>The factual background of this case is identical to that of G. R. No. 
L-19440, entitled "Cesar Climaco, et al. vs. Hon. judge Higinio B. Macadaeg, et 
al." and G. R. No. L-19447, entitled "Adolfo Columbres, et al. vs. Hon. Higinio 
B. Macadaeg, et al." decided jointly on April 18, 1962. Stripped of details, 
which are set forth in our decision in said two (2) cases, the main facts 
are:</p>
<p>On February 28, 1960, the Agro-Industrial Products, Inc., hereafter referred 
to as Agro, a domestic corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of 
our laws, submitted to the President of the Philippines a proposal to purchase 
from the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration, hereafter 
referred to as the ACCFA, of all its unmarketable low-grade tobacco surplus and 
to import one (1) kilo of foreign Virginia leaf tobacco for every four (4) kilos 
of low-grade tobacco so purchased by Agro from the ACCFA. A special cabinet 
committee, created by the President, to study the matter and make 
recommendations thereon found the proposal to be most advantageous for the 
national economy and the local tobacco industry. Hence, upon the recommendation 
of the Cabinet, the President approved said proposal and authorized the purchase 
by Agro of ACCFA low-grade Virginia tobacco, as well as the importation by Agro 
of 4.5 million kilos of foreign Virginia leaf tobacco for blending purposes, 
subject to the conditions set forth in a letter of the Executive Secretary to 
the Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, dated July 29, 1961. 
Implementing the aforementioned presidential authority, and purporting to act in 
pursuance of Section 1 (a) of Republic Act No. 1194, the Central Bank of the 
Philippines, soon later, allocated said 4.5 million kilos, of foreign Virginia 
leaf tobacco among the various local manufacturers of the Virginia type 
cigarettes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, or on July 31, 1961, Adolfo Columbres and Angel Geslani, in their 
behalf and allegedly in that of "about five (5) million Virginia tobacco farmers 
similarly situated", instituted Civil Case No. 47659 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, against the Agro, the Central Bank of the Philippines, the 
Commissioner of Customs, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Philippine 
Virginia Tobacco Administration, to enjoin, preliminarily, and, after due trial, 
permanently, the importation of said 4.5 million kilos of foreign Virginia leaf 
tobacco by the Agro and nullify the presidential authority granted therefor, as 
well as the implementation thereof. Upon the filing of said case No. 47659, the 
following, among others, joined the plaintiffs therein: Potenciano Pati, 
Salvador Somera, Roberto R. Pati, Sixto J. Lazo, Guillermo Anunciacion, Eduardo 
Par, Luciano Naval, Jesus Naval, Rogelio Servileja, Mardelita Flores, Moises 
Ridon, Luis Roldan, Eriberto Rabacal, Jose Reoduque, Romeo Tabanera, Honorio 
Fariñas, Teodorico Yasana and Macario Ines. On November 2, 1961, Hon. Higinio B. 
Macadaeg, who presided over Branch X of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
to which said case had been assigned, ordered the issuance of the writ of 
preliminary injunction therein prayed for. However, on motion for 
reconsideration filed by Agro and the Central Bank, said order was set aside by 
another order dated November 9, 1961, which, likewise, lifted such writ of 
preliminary injunction upon the filing of a counterbond.</p>
<p>Prior thereto, however, or on October 10, 1961, Civil Case No. 3434 of the 
Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte had been filed against the Agro, the 
Central Bank, and the Commissioner of Customs. The plaintiffs therein were 
Alfredo Cajigal and several other persons, including some plaintiffs in Civil 
Case No. 47659 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, namely, the 
aforementioned Potenciano Pati, Salvador Somera, Roberto Pati, Sixto J. Lazo, 
Guillermo Anunciacion, Eduardo Par, Moises Ridon, Eriberto Rabacal, Jose 
Reoduque, Luis Roldan, Luciano Naval, Mardelita Flores, Rogelio Servileja, Jesus 
Naval, Honorio Fariñas, Teodorico Yasana, Macario Ines, Romeo Tabanera, Pablo 
Fernandez, Cesar Dacasin, and Jose Cariño. The allegations made, the issues 
raised and the reliefs prayed for in the complaints in said Civil Case No. 3434 
of Ilocos Norte and in Civil Case No. 47629 of Manila are substantially 
identical. Hence, on October 21,1961, the defendants in said Civil Case No. 3434 
objected to the preliminary injunction therein prayed for and moved for the 
dismissal of the cases, upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject 
matter thereof and to issue the aforementioned writ, and of the pendency of said 
case No. 47659 of the Court of First Instance of Manila. This, notwithstanding, 
the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, presided over by Hon. Delfin 
Flores, by an order dated November 18, 1961, granted the prayer for a writ of 
preliminary injunction, which was issued on December 1, 1961. Immediately 
thereafter, or on December 2, 1961, the respondents in Case No. 8434 moved for a 
reconsideration of said order of November 18, 1951. When this motion for 
reconsideration was called for hearing on December 7, 1961, counsel for the 
plaintiffs in said case No. 3434 moved for the postponement of said hearing 
until December 29, 1961, which Judge Flores granted over the objection of the 
defendants therein.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on December 15, 1961, the latter brought the present action for 
certiorari, with preliminary injunction, against the plaintiffs in said Case No. 
3434, and Judge Flores, upon the grounds relied upon in the motion to dismiss 
said case, dated October 21, 1961, namely, want of jurisdiction and pendency of 
another action between the same parties and for the same cause. Soon thereafter, 
and upon the filing of the requisite bond and its approval, we issued a writ 
enjoining respondents herein from enforcing or implementing said order and writ 
of injunction dated, respectively, November 18 and December 1, 1961.</p>
<p>In their answer, respondents herein maintain that the Court of First Instance 
of Ilocos Norte has jurisdiction over the subject matter of said Civil Case No. 
3434, as well as to issue said order of November 18, 1961, and the writ of 
preliminary injunction dated December 1, 1961; that the pendency of Civil Case 
No. 47659 of the Court of First Instance of Manila does not bar the filing of 
said Civil Case No. 3434 of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte; and 
that the approval by the President of the Philippines, on July 29, 1961 of the 
sale of ACCFA low-grade tobacco to Agro, and the importation by the latter of 
4.5 million kilos of foreign Virginia tobacco, is contrary to law.</p>
<p>With respect to the last pretense of respondents herein, suffice it to say 
that the same has already been overruled and the legality of the aforementioned 
presidential action was upheld in our decision in the aforementioned Civil Cases 
G. R. No. L-19440 and G. R. No. L-19447, promulgated on April 30, 1962. 
Independently of the foregoing, it is clear that respondent Judge had no 
jurisdiction either over the subject matter of said Civil Case No. 3434 of the 
Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte or to issue the injunction therein 
prayed for. In Acosta vs. Alvendia, 109 Phil., 1017; decided on October 31, 
1960, we held that "the jurisdiction or authority of courts of first instance to 
control or restrain acts by means of the writ of injunction is limited to acts 
which are being committed or about to be committed <i>within the territorial 
boundaries of their respective provinces and districts</i>," and the acts sought 
to be restrained in said Civil Case No. 3434 were being committed or about to be 
committed outside the province of Ilocos Norte, or, more particularly, in the 
City of Manila. Then, too, some of the plaintiffs in said Civil Case No. 3434 
were, likewise, plaintiffs in said Civil Case No. 47659 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, aside from the fact that the other plantiffs therein 
represented the same interest represented by the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 
3434; and the cause of action in both cases was the same—the alleged right of 
local tobacco farmers to prevent the importation by Agro of 4.5 million kilos of 
foreign Virginia tobacco, as authorized by the President on July 29, 1961, upon 
the ground that said presidential action is illegal and injurious to the 
interests of said farmers.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case on December 
18, 1961 is hereby made permanent, with costs against respondents herein, 
excluding respondent Judge.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes,</i> 
and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
