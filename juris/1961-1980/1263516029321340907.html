				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A review of Criminal Case No. 1542 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, entitled "The People of the
Philippines, plaintiff, vs. Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Y <span class="SpellE">Ar­nisto</span>, accused", wherein the trial court, in its de­cision
dated October 15, 1965, found the accused guilty of the crime of murder for the
killing of his brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio y <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>, and imposed upon him the supreme penalty of
Death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>, was
prosecuted in the lower court for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Gregorio on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1961</st1:date>,
under <span class="GramE">an information</span> for murder, committed with the
qualifying circumstances of evi­dent premeditation and treachery, and attended
by the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, dwelling and relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood trial under a plea of "not
guilty".</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove the People's case, the prosecution presented at the
trial five witnesses: Dr. Federico Lose, the rural health officer of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, who conducted the
autopsy of the body of the victim; Ma­ria <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>,
the widow of the deceased and sister of the accused; Jose <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>,
the victim's landlord in­to whose house the latter was first brought in a dying
condition immediately after the incident; <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Gregorio, common-law wife of the accused and sister of the victim; and Andres <span class="SpellE">Pador</span>, Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, who conducted the investigation of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The background facts of the case
culled from their testimonies are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">The rain had just stopped at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 o'clock</st1:time> on the night of <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1961</st1:date>, in barrio <span class="SpellE">Tibiao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their house situated on top of a hill, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio and his wife, Maria Gregorio, were
squatting side by side on the kitchen floor under the light of a kerosene lamp
on the "<span class="SpellE">banggerahan</span>" facing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were drinking "tuba" and
munching on roast­ed corn as their "<span class="SpellE">sumsuman</span>"
while their children were preparing for bed in another portion of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The floor of the kitchen was made
of bamboo slats, one inch in width, nailed about one centimeter apart. Sud­denly,
<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> jerked his body, saying "<span class="SpellE">Ne</span>, I was thrust by somebody." <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
stood, his trousers, loosened or slashed by the thrust, dropped to the floor;
and Maria saw her husband clutching a wound in his abdomen from which his
intestines were coming out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instinctively, Maria took hold of the kerosene lamp on the "<span class="SpellE">banggerahan</span>", opened the bamboo slats door of the
kitchen, and looked downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
where she stood, Maria saw a man about two <span class="SpellE"><u>brazas</u></span>
away from her, moving quickly away from the house with his back to­wards
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the aid of the light coming
from the kerosene lamp she was carrying, Maria recognized the man as her
brother, the accused Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>, at whom she
shouted "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span> Luis, you come up and kill all
of us", before he finally disappeared in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wounded husband had moved to the sale
when the wife returned to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
wrapped his body with a blanket, and at <span class="SpellE">Raymundo's</span>
bidding, Maria started beating a hallow bamboo gong to summon help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few neighbors soon answered the call for
aid, and the wounded husband was carried to the house of his land?lord
about 300 meters away, in a hammock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio pleaded to his landlord to give him aid,
but the latter, seeing the seriousness of his condi­tion, advised the wife to
take her husband to town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> did not reach town, however, for on the way, at
the house of one <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>,
he ex­pired that same evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria
Gregorio then in­structed her son and the barrio lieutenant of the place to
report the matter to the authorities in town, and to inform their relatives of
her husband's death. Still later, the body of the victim was ta­ken to the town
where it was autopsied by Dr. Fede­rico <span class="SpellE">Loza</span>, the
rural health officer of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ak­lan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical officer found on the body of the victim an incised
wound about two (2) inches in length in the infra-umbilical region, one inch be­low
the umbilicus, from which wound portions of the small intestines were coming,
presenting multiple incisions including the mesentery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vertically a­ligned with, and about an inch
below this wound was a second one which was superficial. In the necropsy report,
the doctor described the first wound as fa­tal, in consequence of which death
resulted from in­ternal hemorrhage; and in his testimony before the court, he
opined that the wound could have been caused by a bladed or double bladed
instrument like a bolo or <span class="SpellE">talibong</span>, for the edges of
the wound were all clean-cut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judging
from the vertically aligned positions of the two wounds, he ventured further to
say that the two wounds could have been caused by a single thrust.</p>

<p class="BODY">That morning following the night of the inci­dent, people from
the place came to view the re­mains of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Gregorio at the house of <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
where the cadaver lay in state. Among the first relatives to arrive was the
father of the wid­ow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
arrived a little later, <span class="GramE">then</span> left shortly
thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that the widow
told the police officers present that it was her brother Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>, who killed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>
time that very same day, Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> was arrested
and brought to town for investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five days after the commission of the crime, the Chief of Police
of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span> conducted a re-enact­ment of the crime
with the consent of Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> who denied being
the author of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of
police and the accused, along with two other po­licemen, two PC soldiers, and
the widow of the deceased were all present at the scene of the incident for
purposes of said re-enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
examination of the ground under the house of the victim, the chief of police
found three (3) footprints, left and right, which were apparently made by one
without shoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked the accused to
fit his feet in said footprints which the accused did after some reluc­tance;
and the chief of police found that they <span class="GramE">tal­lied,</span>
heels and toes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, at about the
same time that the incident took place on the night of the killing, the chief
of police ordered the widow to go up the house with the PC soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After clos­ing the door of the kitchen, he
asked one of his po­licemen to change clothes with that of the accused and
ordered them to go under the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a
given signal, the PC soldiers asked the widow to open the door of the kitchen
and look out. At that precise time, the policeman and the accused were also re­quired
to walk out at a distance of about six meters, and the widow correctly pointed
to the accused as the man he saw there on the night of the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the chief of police filed the
corresponding complaint against Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution further shows that there had
been a long standing feud between the accused on the one hand, and the deceased
and his widow on the other hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
controversy related to a disagreement between the widow and the accused in
respect of the shares of the property of their par­ents who were both still
living which had been pre­viously assigned to each of them; the portion assign­ed
to the widow and worked upon by the deceased dur­ing his lifetime had been
planted to coconuts, while the portion assigned to the accused remained barren
or <span class="SpellE">cogonal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused expressed a desire that a part of the produce of the widow's
land should be given to him which the deceased never did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dis­agreement between the accused and his
sister was re­cently further aggravated by the fact that the common law wife of
the accused (sister of the deceased) had abandoned him since April, 1961, and
the accused be­lieved that it was the deceased who had given her money and
prompted her to leave their home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And al­though
the last serious quarrel between the accused and the deceased occurred more
than <span class="GramE">ten(</span>10) years be­fore the killing of the
deceased, on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1961</st1:date>,
they had another altercation barely three days before the night of the killing.
The accused drew his bolo on that occasion, but the deceased ran to town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the latter part of that same day the
accused chanced to meet his own common-law wife and the wife of the de­ceased
together in the house of a certain <span class="SpellE">Ciocoro</span> where Luis
<span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> warned his sister (wife of the de­ceased) to
be careful because something may happen in a few days.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his defense, Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
presented evi­dence tending to show that on <st1:date year="1961" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1961</st1:date>, he was in his son-in-law's <span class="SpellE">caingin</span> weeding the plants from morn­ing until the
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Returning to his son-in-law's
house late in the afternoon, he prepared their food for that evening because
his grandson was sick and his daughter had to attend to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still later, he pound­ed about ten <span class="SpellE">gantas</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> which he later
placed in a <span class="SpellE">buri</span> bag.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They ate supper at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00</st1:time>
that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He slept in the house of
his son-in-law where he has been staying since his common-law wife left him in
the <span class="SpellE">the</span> month of April.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was still asleep when in the following <span class="GramE">morning,</span> he was awakened by his son-in-law who informed him
that his brother-in-law has been killed the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And upon learning that the deceased lay in
state in the house of <span class="SpellE">Procopio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maca­rio</span>,
he lost no time in going there to see the remains of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented evidence to show that some other
persons and not the accused have committed the crime imputed to Luis <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
extra-judi­cial confessions of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> and
Federico <span class="SpellE">Layson</span> taken by a PC investigator and sworn
to before the Deputy Clerk of Court were produced in court to show that they
have voluntarily owned the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ray­mundo</span>
Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much to the surprise of the
defense, however, when these alleged killers were placed on the witness stand,
they <span class="SpellE">repudicated</span> their alleged confess­ions and
declared that they were detained in the pro­vincial jail on a complaint for
cattle rustling, and that they knew nothing about the killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They admitted having signed the affidavits containing their admissions
of the killing, but claimed that they only signed the same because they were
manhandled by detention <span class="GramE">prisoners,</span> and the ac­cused in
the provincial jail and, out of fear, were forced to admit the killing of which
they were total­ly ignorant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
expressly denied before the court the truth of the statements they had
previously signed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon these facts, the trial court found the ac­cused guilty as
charged, and as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, senten­ced the accused
to the penalty of death, and to in­demnify the heirs of the decd the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find two main issues which must be resolved before <span class="GramE">We</span> may sustain the conviction of herein appel­lants in the
lower court:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the identification made by the
widow of the accused as the man she saw running away from their house on the
night of the killing of her husband, is worthy of belief; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the trial court was right in
disregarding the extra-judicial confessions of the two detention prisoners
presented by the accused to prove his innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall, therefore, consider the various points discussed by
herein appellant in his brief with those issues foremost in our mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant vigorously assails the credence and weight placed by
the trial judge upon the testimony of the widow of the deceased, on which the
lower court apparently gave full reliance in rendering the judgment of conviction
under appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He brands as incredible
and improbable the story told by the said widow before the court: Thus, that
after the deceased had jerked his body, telling her –“<span class="SpellE">Ne</span>,
I was thrust by somebody", and she saw him clutching at his wounded abdomen
out of which his intestines were billowing out, said widow would immediately
grab the kerosene lamp from their "<span class="SpellE">banggerahan</span>",
open the door of the kitchen and look out into the darkness and survey the
scene outside the house; that she not only saw a man two <span class="SpellE">brazas</span>
away moving quickly from the house, but also recognized that man whose back was
turned against her to be the herein appellant; that she shouted at him "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span> Luis, you come up here and kill all of us"; and
that only after he disappeared completely into the darkness did she finally
turn back to her wounded husband to give him succor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a word, appellant dis­putes the
credibility of the said witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no substantial merit to herein appel­lant's claim that
the above testimony is incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time
after time, this Court has declared that the matter of assigning values to
declarations at the witness stand is best and most competently performed or
carried out by the trial judge because the latter, unlike appellate
magistrates, can weight such testi­mony in the light of the <span class="SpellE">declarant's</span>
demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
And as far as cre­dibility and veracity of witnesses are concerned, the
conclusions of lower courts command great weight and respect,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for their proximate contact with <span class="GramE">those who take to the
witness stand, places</span> them in a more competent position to discriminate
between the true and the false.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Of course, these rules admit of exceptions, as when patent inconsistencies in
the state­ments of witnesses are ignored by the lower court, or when the
conclusion arrived at is clearly unsupported by evidence; but the existence of
any of such except­ions had not been shown in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no cogent reason, therefore, to
disturb the reliance place by the trial court upon the testimony referred to by
herein appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends, that the way the widow had reacted to the
tenseness of the situation she found herself in on that fateful night of the
killing of her husband, is opposed to ordinary human experience - too unnatural
to be believable - for the more natural thing for her to do immediately after
seeing the gap­ing wound in the abdomen of her husband, his intestines coming
out of said wound, would be to rush to his side, to think of her husband’s
safety above all else, or to immediately shout for help and seek the aid of her
neighbors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, therefore, imputes
bad motive on the part of the widow and suggests, that her iden­tification of
the accused as the man the saw that eve­ning was born out of her consuming
hatred for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suggestion should be
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow, perhaps, had not
acted the way <span class="GramE">We</span> would normally expect a wo­man to do
under the circumstances, but considering the nervous condition she must have
found herself under the situation that evening, it is equally probable that she
acted under stress without knowing what to do best under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not difficult to
demonstrate the fact that different people will react in various ways when
placed under stress, and the circumstance that the widow had acted in another
way that to others might appear unnatural is no argument to the proposition
that what she did was impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
is clear from the testimony of the said widow is the fact that she recognized
the man she saw that evening to be her brother, appellant herein, that is why
she shouted at him to "come up here and kill all of us." The widow
acted at the time under a nervous excitement, without time to reflect; and <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot subscribe to the suggestion that she could had
been influenced by any evil motive against herein appel­lant.</p>

<p class="BODY">But appellant would insist that for the widow to have seen and
recognized a man in the dark outside their house after staying for sometime in
the kitchen facing a lamp, is opposed to common knowledge of human experience
to be worthy of reasonable belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
<span class="GramE">be</span> frames his argument in the following wise:
"This woman must be possessed of an uncanny eyesight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After staying for sometime in the kitchen,
facing a lamp, and suddenly looking out into the darkness, she not only
recognized a man running away but was also able to <span class="SpellE">positvely</span>
identify that man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, is incredible in itself because it is contrary
to or­dinary human experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How many
times have <span class="GramE">We</span> expe­rienced stepping out of the street
into the darkness of a <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span> and bump into
chairs and persons, for we fail to see them? Much less could <span class="GramE">We</span>
recognize persons, <span class="SpellE">altho</span> within an arms length, in
such cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the ordinary human
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria Gregorio’s experience
does not fall within this realm; it <span class="GramE">is, thus, not deserving</span>
belief." We are not impress­ed with this argument either. Obviously,
appellant herein overlooks the fact, also supported by ordinary human
experience, that one may easily find his way through in a dark <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span>, may recognize persons not too far away from
him, with the aid of a dimly lighted flashlight of an usher or the light of a
match stick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no parity,
therefore, between the situation of the widow when she looked out in the dark
that fateful evening and the blinding darkness inside a <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span>
described by herein appellant, for the simple reason that the widow looked
outside the door of the kitchen that night with the aid of the light from her
lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria Gregorio testified that the
wick of the kerosene lamp she carried is as big as her pointer finger, and its
flame was about four (4) inches in length.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Although she first stated that the wind blew inside the house when she opened
the door of the kitchen,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
she later qualified her state­ment by explaining that there was no wind that <span class="GramE">eve­ning, that</span> it was calm because the rain had just
stopped.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She described the floor of the house where she stood to be less than five (5)
feet above the ground,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and from there she saw the man down­stairs, about two <span class="SpellE"><u>brazas</u></span>
away from her, moving quick­ly away from the house;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and although he was not facing her,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
she recognized him to be her brother (<span class="SpellE">Manong</span> Luis),
the herein appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
She testi­fied further, that upon seeing him there, she told him, "<span class="SpellE">Manong</span> Luis, you come up and kill all of us."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We are convinced that with the size of the flame of the lamp she was holding at
the time, and within the distance she saw the man downstairs, it was really
possible for the widow to have recognized her own brother as the man she saw
that evening; otherwise, she would not have told him "to come up and kill
all of us", if she was not sure, having no time to re­flect, that he was
her own brother.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant next argues that the lower court er­red in finding that
he had sufficient motive for killing his brother-in-law, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He points out the fact that while his sister, the widow of the deceased,
had testified about a quarrel they had over the inheritance of their par­ents
some ten years ago, she also admitted that said quarrel had long been settled
between them by their own parents who were both still living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends further that neither would the
alleged separation between him and his common-law wife, sister of the deceased,
be a sufficient motive for him to commit the crime because they have in fact
been separated no less than three (3) times during the more than
twenty-five(25) years that they have been living to­gether, and although she
has recently abandoned him and left for Iloilo, she returned to <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, never­theless, on May 28, about a week before the
commis­sion of the crime on June 2, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument should be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe the trial court did not err in finding sufficient motive on
the part of herein appellant to commit the murder of which he stands
convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is abund­ant evidence
on record that barely three (3) days be­fore the killing, the quarrel between
herein appel­lant and the deceased had been renewed where the for­mer drew his
bolo and chased the latter; and later on that very same day, a Tuesday before
the Friday when the killing occurred, herein appellant, upon meeting by chance
the wife of the deceased and his own com­mon-law wife together in the house of
a certain <span class="SpellE">Ciocoro</span> warned his sister "to be
careful, because in a few days something will happen.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It has likewise been shown that herein appellant had suspected that his
common-law wife received money from her elder brother, the deceased, who
induced her to separate from him and leave him for good. This suspicion,
according to the common-law wife, drove him mad; he called her a traitor, and
would want to kill her and her brother, the deceased;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
that is why she had left and finally decided to leave him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that whether it be
the quarrel over the inheritance of their parents or the suspicion of herein
appellant that the deceased was the cause of his separation from his common-law
wife which led to the commission of the crime, the indubitable fact that stands
out in the record is the existence of bad blood between herein appellant and
the deceased before the demise of the latter; and We are convinced that either
of the above-mentioned causes could be a suf­ficient motive on the part of
herein appellant for the killing of his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do <span class="GramE">We</span> find incredible the
testimony of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, that the foot­prints he found under the house of the
deceased were similar in size to those of herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the said footprints
were discovered five days after the killing and were then no longer fresh, he
explained that the ground where the foot­prints were found was wet because it
is the place where water from the kitchen spreads or settles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would hence be safe to surmise that said
part of the ground under the house will be soft and footprints thereon will be
well-defined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance that it
had been raining then in <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span> for the last five
days as pointed to by herein appellant could not have affected the footprints
because, as testified to by the chief of police, that part of the ground under
the house was not exposed to rain­fall; and neither was said part of the ground
af­fected by the flow of water from the kitchen, for the house had been vacated
by the family of the de­ceased after the killing on June 2, 1961.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The footprints aforesaid, were therefore preserved, which enabled the chief of
police to ascertain the similarity in size of the footprints and the feet of
herein appellant after asking the latter to in­sert or superimpose his feet
into said footprints.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The evidence alone, of course, is not conclusive of the fact that the said
footprints were those of here­in appellant, but it tends to show in some
reasonable degree that someone whose feet are of said sizes had been there; and
since herein appellant had been po­sitively identified by the widow to be the
person she saw running away from the scene of the crime on the night of the
killing, the circumstances point strongly to herein appellant as the one who
left said footprints.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="GramE">We</span> are convinced that the
defenses of <u>alibi</u> and projection offered by herein appellant do not
merit any serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
been clearly established by the evidence, both for the prosecution and for the
appellant, that the houses of the deceased and that of <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macario</span> where here­in appellant lives since he was
abandoned by his com­mon-law wife, are only about two (2) or two and a half
(2-1/2) kilometers apart,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and there is a trail connecting the two houses.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It was then not really impossible for herein appellant to be at the scene of
the crime at about 7:00 o'clock on the night of the killing, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the claim that he was at <span class="SpellE">Dioscorots</span>
house preparing food for supper and pounding <span class="SpellE">palay</span> at
the time,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and did not leave the house after his arrival at about 5:00 o'clock that
afternoon from the "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>" of his son-in?law.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the defense of <u>alibi</u> here will not prosper on account of the
positive identifica­tion of herein appellant by an eyewitness that he was seen
at the scene of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the defense of projection, appel­lant vigorously
maintains that it was error on the part of the trial court to have concluded
that the extra-judicial confessions of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>
and Fe­lipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> owning the killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio were not made freely and
voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He relies heavily upon the
testimony in court of the Deputy Clerk of Court before whom the above-named
detention prisoners in the provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>
subscribed to their confessions to the effect, that be first read the questions
and answers in their respective affidavits and translated them to Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> in their
native dialect which they understood,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
after which Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> willingly signed his name,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
while Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> voluntarily affixed his thumb
mark also;<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
that no complaint whatsoever was made at the time by either Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
or Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
before they signed and affixed their names and thumb marks on their re­spective
confessions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also pointed out that
a PC officer had testified that he personally conduct­ed and recorded the
confessions of the above-named detention prisoners;<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
that there were other PC soldiers present when be conducted the said investi­gation;<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
and that no force, threat, intimidation or promise of any reward was made upon
them at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of the confessions, according to
herein appellant is further sustained by the testimony of the provincial warden
to the ef­fect that he was not aware of any manhandling of said prisoners while
they were under his custody;<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
that he had brought along Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> to the PC headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Tuliols</span>
own behest, because he confided to him that they had a hand in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio;<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
and that as he was present during the investigation, he knew for a fact that
said detention prisoners were not manhandled by the PC during the
investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
The bone of appellant's contention, therefore, is that the said confess­ions
were made freely and voluntarily, and should have been admitted by the trial
court in exculpation of herein appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument merits no serious consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are clear signs in the record showing that the alleged
confessions were not made freely and volun­tarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>
and Federico <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> were presented in court for the
defense of herein appellant, but they turned hostile to his cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> testified
that he had never committed the crime; that he only admitted the crime because
he was badly beaten in jail by other prisoners and was then out of his mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>, on the other hand, complained that on
the very day of his arrest at <span class="SpellE">Jamindan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, for reasons unknown to him, the PC soldier who
arrested him, hit him at the back three (3) times with the butt of his gun.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
He was first delivered to the munici­pal jail of <span class="SpellE">Jamindan</span>,
<span class="GramE">then</span> transferred to the PC head­quarters at <span class="SpellE">Loctungan</span> where he received further tor­ture.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
From there, he was taken to the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>,
and still later to the provincial jail of <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>,
where herein appellant, also a deten­tion prisoner there at the time, beat him
several times, warning him that if he will not admit the kill­ing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio at the investigation at the PC
headquarters, he will kill him upon his return to the provincial jail.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
He testified further that his right eyebrow had been shed as a matter of fact
due to such manhandling before he was taken to the PC headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Buswang</span> where the confession took place.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
There is a showing that such manhandling really took place, for even the Deputy
Clerk of Court who testified for the defense, admitted that when the pre­pared
statement of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> was taken to him for
ratification, <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> "was weak, that even in
signing the papers, it took him time in signing and even the voice when I asked
him, he just nod his head, sometimes he said yes"; that "he noticed
in his face, a slight contusion and he was weak,"<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
while Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> "was also weak and had a
black eye at the time."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
The PC sergeant who conducted the investigation and took the statements of said
deten­tion prisoners also admitted that when he fetched <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>
from the provincial jail "he had bruises on his right face which was
somewhat swollen."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a> And
so with the provincial warden who testified that when Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> was first brought to the provin­cial jail, he
already "had sore eyes."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
There is also a glaring discrepancy between the testimony of the provincial
warden and the PC sergeant who took the testimony of said detention
prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the sergeant claimed
that he conducted the investi­gation of said detention prisoners at the behest
of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span> before whom one <span class="SpellE">Pre­sentacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> had lodged a
complaint for theft of large cattle, and he had taken said prisoners from the
provincial jail to investigate them in connect­ion therewith; and that he only
happened to inquire from them about the killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Gregorio be­cause the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span> also
made mention to him regarding the said killing, the provin­cial warden, on the
other hand, claimed that without being asked, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>
made a statement to him of his desire to confess about his involvement in the
killing of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> Gregorio, that is why he suggest­ed
that they go to the PC headquarters where he may make his confession.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
And the Court sees no rea­son why the Chief of Police had to indorse the com­plaint
of <span class="SpellE">Presentacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span>
against said prisoners to the PC headquarters for further investigation of the
alleged theft of large cattle, when it is admit­ted, by the PC sergeant himself
who conducted the investigation that at the time he took the statements of said
prisoners, the corresponding complaint had been filed by the Chief of Police in
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Altavas</span>, which remitted the
case to the Court of First Instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
Such facts and circumstances altogether convince the Court that the trial court
was right in holding that the extra-judicial confessions of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> relied
upon by herein appellant were not made by them freely and voluntarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if <span class="GramE">We</span> were to assume that the
said con­fessions were made freely and voluntarily, which is not a fact, as
earlier shown, We still have to reckon the question of admissibility of such
Confessions as substantive evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Rules provide that the de­claration of an accused expressly acknowledging his
guilt of the offense charged, may be given in evidence against him,<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
but this would seem to exclude the confession of a third person for or against
him. The said Rules provide further that a declaration of a person against his
interest may be used against third persons,<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
but such provision would not be applica­ble to this case either, even if We
were to consider the confessions under consideration as a declaration against
interest and the State as a third person, be­cause it is a further requirement
that before a decla­ration against interest may be admissible, it must be shown
that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> is either deceased, outside of the
Philippines, or unable to testify, which is not true here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, the rule that as long
as the <span class="SpellE">declar­ant</span> of available as a witness, his
extra-judicial statement should not be heard.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in accord with the weight of
authority in American jurisprudence which holds that a confession on the part
of a third person tending to exculpate an accused, is not admis­sible in
evidence where the confession does not consti­tute a part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>, the
reason given by the courts for excluding such evidence is that it is hear­say.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
We recall that this question of admissibility of such kind of confession was
once raised in issue here where this Tribunal did not reach any accord on the
matter,<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
but even if We were to follow the opinion of the three (3) members of the Court
there that such kind of evidence is admissible, We would still find the
conclusion reached by the trial court legally sustainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For ultimately, its value
would depend upon the weight given or assigned to it by the trial court.</span>
Here, the lower court did not believe the statement in the alleged confessions
of Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Tulio</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>
that they used a spear made of bamboo in killing <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
Gregorio due to the improbability of causing, with such kind of weapon, the
incised clean-cut wound found by the medical of­ficer on the body of the
deceased, and We find no reasonable basis upon the evidence of record to dis­turb
that conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the lower court that the crime was committed with
treachery may not be seriously disputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By suddenly attacking the victim from un­der the house, the assailant
had employed a means in the execution of the crime which tend directly and
specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the
defense which the offended party might make.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aggravating circumstance of nighttime, however, may no longer be
separately con­sidered, the same being included in the qualifying circumstance
of treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for this rule is that nighttime forms part of the peculiar
treacherous means and manner adopted to insure the execution of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
But the lower court was right in considering the aggravating circumstance of
dwelling which is applicable even if it be shown that the perpetrator of the
crime never entered the house where the victim was at the time of the attack.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
There being no mitigating circumstance to off-set the aggravating circumstance
of dwelling, the penalty imposed by law should be imposed in its maximum
period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writer of this opinion believes that the
lower court was right in sentencing the herein appellant to the supreme penalty
