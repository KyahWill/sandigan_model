<blockquote>In order to shed light to this case, Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span>
personally testified during the mediation stage and stated that without her
knowledge, the amount of P4,000 was taken by Mr. Victor Santos from the
envelope containing the cash prize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was at that time, personally indebted to Mr. Victor Santos of the sum of P4,000
for a diamond ring which she purchased on installment basis on <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1973</st1:date> as evidenced by
hereto attached promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
further testified that she did not have any intention of filing a complaint
against Mr. Mario Reyes were it not for the instigation and prodding of Mr.
Romeo Henson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The other witness Mr. Victor Santos also testified to the fact that
he was the one who took the P4,000 as payment to him by Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> for a diamond ring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Mr. Santos explained the whole thing and after he had issued a
receipt to Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> for the P4,000, Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> withdrew her complaint from <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span>
and returned the check to respondent <st1:place>Co.</st1:place></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is crystal clear from the evidences and testimonies presented by
witnesses that complainant Mario Reyes was innocent of what had transpired to
the sum of P4,000 and he was just a victim of an honest mistake.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent company does not have any right to suspend complainant
after Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> had clarified the whole matter to
them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent does not have any sound basis to lose their trust and
confidence in complainant who had rendered service with the company for almost
8 years.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>RECOMMENDATION</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of the foregoing, it is respectfully recommended that
complainant be reinstated with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and request
for clearance of respondent be denied."</blockquote>

P4,000 from the envelope containing Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao's</span>
cash prize as payment of the balance of the diamond ring he sold to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that after these circumstances

full payment of the diamond ring by Mr. Victor Santos, Miss Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> withdrew her complaint against complainant Mario

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Anent the first ground, respondents
allege that reinstatement with payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
cannot be ordered "in the absence of a finding of unfair labor practice
(as in this case)", and that mere loss of confidence will suffice for the
dismissal of a supervisory or managerial employee, such as petitioner in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the second ground, the main
thrust of respondents' argument is that it was clear error for the Minister of

already been withdrawn or retracted by her . . ." They allege that in
termination cases, direct and positive evidence of an employee's guilt of the

<p class="BODY">The Office of the President decided the appeal by a 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision was arrived at after additional
hearings were conducted by it on July 15, July 25 and <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reversed the decision of the Minister of
Labor dated August 22, 1974 ordering the reinstatement of petitioner with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, having found <span class="SpellE">Tagulao's</span>
"diamond ring story" implausible, thus: </p>

<blockquote>"At the <span class="SpellE">factfinding</span> proceedings of <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1974</st1:date>, Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> for the first time stated the reason for her
retraction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to her, she owed
Victor Santos (the promotions supervisor with whom she and the complainant
proceeded to the bank for the cashing of the prize money check) the balance of
P4,000 for a diamond ring which she purchased from the latter on installment
basis since <u>November 15, 1973</u>, as per a promissory note she executed in
his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that she filed
the complaint against Mario Reyes because she was allegedly instigated by Romeo
Henson, production coordinator of the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Received for all and whatever it is worth,
the promissory note allegedly executed by <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> in
Victor Santos' favor sans the formalities ordinarily attendant to such
undertakings exists as a document the truth of which can never really be
ascertained except on the verbal testimony of the person supposedly its
author.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of this note,
however, was never revealed to the respondent at the time Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> complained on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If as alleged by Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> the P4,000
deducted from the prize money on the very day the check was cashed represented
payment of the promissory note, then Victor Santos, the supposed creditor,
could have simply asked for the P4,000 balance from her, the alleged debtor,
and just demanded a receipt for the payment of such amount, nothing more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, in her letter-complaint against
Mario Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> charged that she was made by the
complainant herein to believe that the P4,000 deducted from her prize money was
for consolation prizes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contradictory allegations of <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> puts her
credibility in serious doubt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, a week or so had passed since the filing of her complaint
on January 16, 1975, up to her retraction on January 24, 1975, and within this
period, Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> set up entirely different and
opposite explanations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also, during
the entire period of time that passed from the encashment of the check in
December 1973 to the filing of the complaint on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1974</st1:date>, <u>the P4,000 was not delivered to the
winner, Miss Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This leads this office to gravely doubt the
integrity of her retraction and suspect that her letter of <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1975</st1:date> was, more than anything else,
made to exculpate the complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, this Office is inclined
to hold that complainant's guilt as complained has not been satisfactorily
erased.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the finding of the Minister of Labor that the complaint
against petitioner was due to "instigation and prodding of Mr. Romeo
Henson, Promotions Coordinator at <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span> and
Company, Inc.,", the Office of the President made the following
observations:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>"For his part, Romeo Henson, testifying on oath before this
Office on <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1975</st1:date>,
disclosed that as promotions manager of the respondent, he had to see to the
proper and orderly disposition of awards in promotional contests, including
that in which the complainant was allegedly irregularly involved and in which
Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> emerged winner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Tipped off by one Romeo Real, promotions supervisor of the
pharmaceuticals division of the respondent, on alleged anomalies attending the
aforesaid contest, Henson accordingly proceeded to investigate the matter and
visited <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> at the latter's residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon he learned from the winner that she
received P20,000, the complainant having allegedly told her that the P4,000 was
allocated for consolation prizes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
therefore informed her that she should have received P24,000, and that the
company shall forthwith remit to her the balance of P4,000, upon her proper
notice to the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> drafted a handwritten letter to the company which
Henson picked up at the winner's office the following day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Henson, who admitted being a '<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>'
and a personal friend of the complainant, averred that both he and <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> never discussed anything beyond the winner's desire
to have the balance of her prize money remitted to her by <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span>
&amp; Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He therefore expressed
surprise at <span class="SpellE">Tagulao's</span> subsequent 'retraction'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, he vehe­mently denied having prodded
or instigated <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> to file the complaint against
Mario Reyes, and that his only purpose was to help Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span>
recover the balance of the prize due her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A circumspect consideration of the testimonies adduced in this case
leads this Office to believe the version of Henson than <span class="SpellE">Tagulao's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the natural course of things no amount
of prodding by Henson could have moved <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span> to
make the complaint against anybody if she were not short-changed in the payment
of the prize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if there really was a
private transaction between her and Victor Santos and/or Mario Reyes which
accounted for the withholding or non-remittance to her of the P4,000, it is
beyond comprehension why she would still file, as she did file, the complaint
in question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Office of the President concluded:</p>

<blockquote>"There is, therefore, basis for the respondent to claim that
it had lost confidence on the complainant employee, in the light of the fact
that the complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> de­liberately withheld
the sum of P4,000 from Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span>, the latter
receiving only P20,000 from the original prize money of P24,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The turnabout of events as manifested in <span class="SpellE">Tagulao's</span> retraction fails to convince this Office of the
innocence of the complainant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from the
irregularity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, the complain­ant
has sufficiently given his employer, the respondent, ground for loss of
confidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Office (so) holds that the foregoing circumstances are
sufficient for the respondent employer to terminate (the services of) the
complainant employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is not wise
to tolerate the latter to remain in his position simply because of the questionable
retraction by the winner of the sales promotional contest because the breach of
trust has already been committed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The interest not only of the respondent corporation, but of the public
itself is involved, since promotional contests such as the one involved herein
are advertised to the public at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
respon­dent was, therefore, justified in requesting the termination of the
services of its managerial employee, the complainant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Secretary of Labor dated </u><st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="8"><u>August 22, 1974</u></st1:date><u>, is
therefore hereby reversed, and the request for clear­ance to terminate
complainant's employment is granted.</u>" (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>

dated <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that the Office of the President acted without
or in excess of juris­diction and/or with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction in issuing the questioned decision dated November 12,
1976 and the resolution dated February 8, 1977 denying his Motion for
Reconsideration, on the grounds that the Office of the President -</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Does not have any jurisdiction to entertain the
appeal; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Has no authority to conduct a new hearing on
appeal for the purpose of fishing new or additional evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first ground, petitioner argues that the
appeal of respondents does not fall under Section 13, Rule XIII of the Rules
and Reg­ulations Implementing the Labor Code, <u>infra</u>, since the grounds
alleged in the said appeal are not those prescribed by the aforesaid provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second ground, petitioner insists that the Office of
the President "committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
juris­diction when, apart from reviewing the case on the basis of the evidence
on records, (it) went further by conducting a new hearing on appeal . . ."</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span> and Co. and
E.G. Vito on the other hand contend that --</p>

<blockquote>“. . . The allegation of being contrary to law and jurisprudence is
really one such purely on questions of law which is therefore in keeping with
par. (b) of Sec. 13, Rule XIII and, the allegation that serious errors in the
findings of facts would definitely lead one to conclude as to prima facie
evidence of abuse of discretion and therefore substantially in keeping with
par. (a) of Sec. 13, Rule XIII."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the allegation that the Office of the President does not have
jurisdiction to conduct a new hearing on appeal, they maintain that a new
hearing was necessary because of "patent inconsis­tencies" in the
case for the complainant which must be clarified so that the Office of the
President may render a "judicious decision."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
postulates — similarly with the private respondents — that "serious errors
in the findings of facts" relied upon by respondents may be considered as
falling under "abuse of discretion" (par. [a], Sec. 13, Rule XIII)
whereas the averment that "the order is contrary to law and jurisprudence
on the matter" may be considered as a ground raising a question of law
(par. [b], Sec. 13, Rule XIII).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the propriety/legality of the new hearings conducted by the
Office of the President, the Solicitor General maintains that "(T)here is
no law which prohibits the Office of the President from conducting additional
hearings in an appealed case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it is by itself an administrative body and as such is
possessed with <span class="SpellE">factfinding</span> prerogatives, especially
so when the purpose thereof is necessary, nay indispensable, to the proper
adjudication of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, public respondent found the evidence on record wanting in some important
factual aspects as to be able to determine whether or not petitioner's
suspension and/or dismissal was justified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus it could not be said that public respondent abused its discretion in
conducting additional hearings prompted as it was by its desire to render a
correct and just decision."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing discussions/arguments the following issues
emerge for Our resolution, i.e. –</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the Office of the President has
jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of private respondents, under Rule XII,
Sec. 13 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

without or in excess of its jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of discretion

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not petitioner's dismissal on the
ground of loss of confidence is justified.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now to resolve the foregoing in <u>seriatim</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We perceive no difficulty
in sustaining respondents' claim on the first issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They relied in their appeal to the Office of
the President on the following:</p>

<blockquote>“a) The Order is contrary to law and jurisprudence on the matter;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“b) The Order contains serious errors in the findings of facts and
would cause grave or irreparable damage and injury to the appellants;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">whereas, the grounds provided under Rule
XIII, Section 13 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code, are:</p>

<blockquote>“a) If there is prima facie evidence of abuse of discretion;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b) If made purely on questions of law; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“c) If there is a showing that the national security or social and
economic stability is threatened."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s allegation that the grounds relied upon are not
those provided for is more apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the truth is, as the Solicitor General and the private respondents
point out, the allegation that "(T)he order is contrary to law and
jurisprudence on the matter" raises a question of law and hence can be
subsumed under paragraph (b), <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed when one alleges that an order is <u>contrary
to law and jurisprudence</u>, plain common sense dictates that the order is
being attacked <u>on question of law</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the second ground — that "the order contains serious
errors in the findings of facts and would cause grave or <span class="SpellE">ireparable</span>
damage and injury to appellants" — is in the final analysis tantamount to
alleging <u>"abuse of discretion</u>", and may be subsumed under
paragraph (a), supra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Serious errors in
the findings of facts may not <u>per</u> <u>se</u> be equated with abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Rule XIII, Section 7<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules and Regulations providing for appeals from the decision of the
Labor Arbiter or compulsory arbitrator to the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span>,
"abuse of discretion" and "serious errors in the findings of
facts" are two separate and distinct grounds, i.e. (a) and (d)
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, a
careful perusal of private respondents' appeal will show that they are raising
principally grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Minister in rendering
his decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously stated, the
main thrust of respondents' argument is that under the circumstances of the
case, the Minister made a palpably erroneous con­clusion in holding that
petitioner did not commit a breach of respondents' trust and confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is tantamount to ascribing to him an
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the first ground, which raised a question of law,
already conferred jurisdiction in the Office of the President to entertain the
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Petitioner's bare allegation that the Office of the President
acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of
discretion in conducting a new hearing on appeal is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, if that were his belief, he should
not have taken part in the hearing, and testified therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
He should have taken proper legal steps to raise his objection at the earliest
opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his participation and
cooperation in said new hearing, he is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from complaining that the Office of the President conducted new hearings on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, petitioner can cite no
law or jurisprudence to support his argument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the truth is, as pointed out by the Solicitor General, "(T)here
is no law which prohibits the Office of the President from conducting
additional hearings in an appealed case”<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
and that the said Office "is by itself an administrative body and as such
is possessed with fact finding prerogative, especially so when the purpose
thereof is necessary, nay indispensable, to the proper adjudication of the
case." Further, the Solicitor General observed that the new hearing was
necessary because "public respondent found the evidence on record wanting
in some important factual aspects as to be able to determine whether or not
petitioner's suspension and/or dismissal was justified."</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Is petitioner's dismissal on the ground of loss of confidence
justified?</p>

<p class="BODY">Loss of confidence is a valid ground for dismissing an employee,
and proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employee's misconduct – appar­ently
demanded by the Minister of Labor – is not required to dismiss him on this
charge.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
It is sufficient if there is "some basis" for such loss of
confidence;<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
or if the employer has reasonable grounds to believe, if not to entertain the
moral conviction that the employee concerned is responsible for the misconduct
and that the nature of his participation there­in rendered him absolutely
unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is an admitted fact that petitioner is a
managerial employee, one in whom respondent Company has given its complete
trust and confidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
He was, at the time of the anomaly, per his own claim, "concurrent Acting
Manager of Leo Pharmaceutical (a division of respondent Company) and Credit and
Collection Manager."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
The Company, therefore, was justified in expecting that his actuations should
be above suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of
petitioner's involvement in the raffle anomaly, i.e., having withheld from the
winner Miss <span class="SpellE">Tagulao</span>, P4,000 of the P24,000 prize
money, which withholding he was not able to explain convincingly much less
disprove, "it is not", in the words of the decision of the Office of
the President, "wise to tolerate the latter (petitioner) to remain in his
position . . . because the breach of trust has already been committed."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner would also pray that the writ of mandamus issue
against the Office of the President, directing said Office to confine its
review of the decision of the Minister of Labor solely on the evidence
presented and established during the hearing conducted at the mediation-<span class="SpellE">factfinding</span> stage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner would, in effect, request this Court to prevent said Office
from considering the evidence presented at the hearings conducted by the said
Office, in its resolution of the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition also lacks merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the first place, the office of the writ of mandamus is to direct
"any tribunal x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
board or person" to perform "an act which the law specifically
enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, there is no duty that the Office of the President
neglected to do which would warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, as has been observed earlier, the
petitioner did not take legal steps to prevent said hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, he participated in the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is therefore now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the said proceedings through a
request for the issuance of a writ of mandamus which, obviously, is not the
proper remedy.</p>
