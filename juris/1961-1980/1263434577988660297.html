After consuming the two bottles of gin, <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr.
left the shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long, thereafter,
Reynaldo Mars went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on his
way, he passed by <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>,
Jr. at the water pump near the stairway of his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He overheard <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
ask <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Sino <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span> <span class="SpellE">utol</span>?" Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr.
answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"He is a <span class="SpellE">matadero</span>, at the NEPA-Q-MART." <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
then said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Kursunada</span>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>", to which <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr. replied:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Yes, go ahead, I will follow you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Susundan</span> <span class="SpellE">kita</span>)."
Upon hearing this, Reynaldo Mars interceded in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> and told <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Huwag</span> <span class="SpellE">naman</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyong</span> <span class="SpellE">gawin</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>

Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr. followed him to the shop and asked <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> for some cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, however,
had no cigarettes and told <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We
had no cigarette here, wait a minute, I will buy with Rene." So, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> and Reynaldo Mars left the shop to look for some
cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While buying cigarettes,
they noticed that <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>
had followed them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After buying the
cigarettes, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> gave them to <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo Mars then told <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> that they better go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way, Mars saw <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
pull out a "<span class="SpellE">patalim</span>", so that he told <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Faster, they might over­come us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They might overtake us." But, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
did not believe him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
overtook <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> at the foot of the stairs of the
latter's house and immediately stabbed him with a "<span class="SpellE">patalim</span>",
"at the left side lower or below the armpit." Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>,
Jr. went after Reynaldo Mars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
latter was able to run home and his wife had immediately closed the door after
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While inside the house, Reynaldo
Mars heard a commotion (<span class="SpellE">kalabugan</span>) outside near the
stairs of the house of <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After a time, the wife of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
was heard shouting for help:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">kami</span>, <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span>

his house and saw <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
lying flat on his back and Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span> was stabbing <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> with a "<span class="SpellE">veinte-nueve</span> (29) <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> knife."
<span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>, who was
beside Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span> was holding a "<span class="SpellE">patalim</span>," and about to stab <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>("May <span class="SpellE">akma</span> <span class="SpellE">siyang</span>

</span><span class="SpellE">Mateos</span> was afraid so he went back to his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few minutes, he heard
another call for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went down and
saw <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> lying prostrate on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> was
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he lifted <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
and carried him to the store to call for a taxicab that would take them to the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>,
with weapons in hand, blocked his way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was asked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Where are you
going?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you like to die?" He was
afraid, so, he returned to his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime later, a police mobile car arrived and <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
was brought to the V. Luna Hospital.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Reynaldo Mars assisted in taking <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> to the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived thereat, <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> was already
dead, and on removing his clothes, Reynaldo Mars saw that <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
had stab wounds on the chest, face and both arms.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

upon the ground that the guilt of the accused had not been established beyond
reasonable doubt, pointing to a discrepancy in the declaration of Reynaldo Mars
which would render his testimony unworthy of credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel prays, in the alternative, that the
said judgment be modified and the penalty imposed upon the accused reduced, in
view of the absence of evident premeditation, treachery, and abuse of
superiority to qualify the offense or aggravate the penalty, and the presence
of the alternative circumstance of intoxication to mitigate the penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, upon the other hand, contends that the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
is guilty of murder, qualified by treachery; but recommends the reduction of
the penalty to imprisonment of from 15 years, as minimum, to 20 years of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u>, as maximum, since evident premeditation and abuse of
superiority were not attendant to the crime, and the presence of intoxication
as a mitigating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">After examining the records, We find no reason to disturb the
findings of the trial court that the accused <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> was an active participant in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo Mars, a close friend of the accused,
Juan <span class="SpellE">Mateos</span>, and Elena <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
positively identified him as one of those who stabbed <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

wherein he said that he did not actually see the stabbing of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, had been
sufficiently explained by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated
that he did not implicate <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr. in
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
when he executed the statement before the police because he was afraid of
reprisals from <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>,
Jr. who were at large and "this Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>,
Jr. used to return there and they were threatening me."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it was not Reynaldo Mars alone who witnessed the
stabbing incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elena <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> testified that she saw Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
helping one another in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Juan <span class="SpellE">Mateos</span> also declared that he saw <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> about to stab <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.

The trial court found that the capacity of these witnesses for telling the
truth cannot be doubted since they have no motive to testify falsely against
the accused, especially Reynaldo Mars who considers himself a friend of the
accused <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>,
his teacher in karate.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The information alleged that the crime of murder was qualified by
evident premeditation, treachery, and taking advantage of superior
strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of record, however,
cannot sustain a finding of evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The meeting between <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> was not sought after and the senseless
killing of <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> for fun was made at the spur of
the moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dia­monon</span>
did not even know who <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> was and it was only
when they were drinking that <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> met <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> for the first time, such that <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
was heard to ask <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Sino <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>, <span class="SpellE">utol</span>?" Besides, no
motive existed as to precipitate the killing, and, moreover, no sufficient
period of time had inter­vened between the time the killing was conceived,
(when <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Kursunada</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">iyan</span>," to which <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>
replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, go ahead I will
follow you") up to the time of its perpetration, for the accused to have
made a cool and circumspect deliberation of the consequences of their intended
act.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also obvious from the records that treachery was not
present in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reynaldo Mars stated that, upon overhearing the foregoing remarks of <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, he went
back to the furniture shop to warn <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> of the peril to his life and he even tried to lead
<span class="SpellE">Maca­sinag</span> to a place of safety, but <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> refused to believe him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, while on their way home, he saw <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> pull out a "<span class="SpellE">patalim</span>",
so that he told <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>,
"faster, they might overcome us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They might overtake us." Again, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
did not believe what he was saying, so that they were overtaken at the foot of
the stairs of the house of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> and <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attack was frontal and the deceased had
been <span class="SpellE">forwarned</span> of the intended attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had every opportunity to evade it, by
running away, or to make whatever defense he is capable of.</p>

<p class="BODY">But abuse of superiority had been duly proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, both armed with knives, had cooperated
in such a way as to secure advantage from their combined superiority in
strength and took turns in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, who was unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Elena <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, who was sleeping in the house
of her brother on the night in question, declared that she was awakened by the
commotion ("<span class="SpellE">kalabugan</span>") at the foot of
their stairs and when she opened the door, she saw Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>,
Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>
helping one another in stabbing <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> who was lying on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Juan <span class="SpellE">Mateos</span>, a
neighbor of <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, upon hearing the cry of the
wife of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
for help, went down his house and saw <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> lying flat in his back and Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr. was stabbing him with a knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> was beside <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span> and
about to stab <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>("May <span class="SpellE">akma</span> <span class="SpellE">siyang</span> <span class="SpellE">sumaksak</span>.") The crime
committed is, therefore, murder, qualified by abuse of superiority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, however, is entitled to the mitigating circumstance
of intoxication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo Mars declared
that <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> and
Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr. were already drunk when they entered
the furniture shop and continued drinking the two bottles of gin they had
brought along with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further
declared that during the time he had known <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span>,
he had not seen him drunk in any other occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony is, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
were these two persons, Ely <span class="SpellE">Calicdan</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Jerberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Diamonon</span> drinking at
about 10:00 o'clock in the afternoon of November 17, 1971?</blockquote>

incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not know that they were drinking but I
saw them when they arrived at the place and I saw them with two bottles of
beer.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since the intoxication of the accused was
not habitual nor intentional intoxication should be appreciated as a mitigating
circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is murder, qualified by abuse of superior

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the conviction for murder.  The killing was ag­gravated by treachery and abuse of
superiority.  These circums­tances were
alleged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent as to the penalty imposed.  While the intoxication seemed to be unintentional and, therefore,
it should be mitigating, nevertheless, it is offset by the aggravating
circumstance of dwelling.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dwelling is aggravating because the killing took place at the
foot of the stairs of the victim's house which were an integral part of his
dwelling (Decision of January 8, 1884 of the Supreme Court of Spain cited in
People vs. Alcala, 46 Phil. 738, 744; People vs. Uday, 85 Phil. 498, 504;
People vs. Madedis Sali, 91 Phil. 911).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the proper penalty is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,
the medium period of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> maximum to death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the penalty should be imposed in the minimum period, the
appropriate indeterminate sentence (considering the perversity of the accused)
should be seventeen years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> medium, as
minimum, to twenty years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> maximum, as
maximum.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKASIAR, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant should be convicted of murder qualified by
treachery and aggravated by abuse of superior strength and dwelling, mitigated only
by intoxication, justifying the imposition of the supreme penalty of
death.  The victim was not prepared to
defend himself as he did not believe the warning of his companion and state
witness Reynaldo Mars that the appellant and his companion Ely Calicdan, Jr.
were following them to assault him.  And
even if he shared the fears of Reynaldo Mars, he had no means with which to
defend himself when he was attacked suddenly immediately after the two
assailants overtook him at the stairs of his own house.  The murder by these two thrill-killers of
the deceased - a peaceful and trusting soul who earned his living as a butcher
- was totally senseless because the deceased had not given them any provocation
at all nor any reason for them to assault him; on the contrary, the deceased
bought and gave them cigarettes when they asked such cigarettes from him.  Night time, which is absorbed by treachery,
was purposely taken advantage of by the assailants, who persisted in following
the deceased until he reached his house, feeling secure that at that late hour
of the night - about 11 o'clock or close to midnight - nobody would dare stop
them from their criminal act, as in fact nobody dared.  Even the neighbors who wanted to take the
mortally wounded victim to the hospital were intimidated by the assailants from
extending such help.  Both assailants
fled from the scene of the crime.  Appellant Diamonon left his residence at Piñahan District, Quezon City,
one month after the incident, which occurred at Matatag Street, Piñahan
District, less than a kilometer from the Quezon City police headquarters near
the corner of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue and Kamuning Street, and eluded the
police until he returned thereto three years later.  Until this date, or almost eight (8) years from the date of the
incident on November 17, 1971, the other assailant Ely Calicdan, Jr. has not
been apprehended despite the fact that he used to return to the neighborhood
threatening state witness Reynaldo Mars with reprisal.</p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the decision herein should be furnished the Commanding
General of the Metrocom, the chief of the Northern Police District Command at
Quezon City, and the Commanding General of the Philippine Constabulary for the
immediate arrest of Ely Calicdan, Jr.</p>
