is no more right of redemption to exercise, the property having been restored
to the former <span style="">owner </span>thereof, His
Honor, the Trial Judge accordingly dismissed the case, without costs,</p>

<p class="BODY">A reconsideration of this decision ha<span style="">ving </span>been denied, the tenants seasonably appealed to the Court of
Appeals, upon the ground that said decision and the resolution denying its r<span style="">e</span>consi­deratio<span style="">n </span>are <span style="">"</span>unsupported
by evidence and are against and contrary to law." In due <span style="">course </span>thereafter the Court of Appeals
rendered the appealed decision, from which we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Defendant Elena <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> having admittedly sold the <span style="">property </span>in question to her co?defendant,
as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale dated August 4, 1964, without
plaintiffs' knowledge, and the said sale having been presumably registered
because TCT No, 42854-R was issued in the name of the vendee, plaintiffs had a
right to redeem the same "within two years from the registration of the
sale, and shall have priority over any other right of legal redemption"
under said Section 12 of Republic Act No, 3844.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs did exercise the said right of redemption as per paragraph 8
of the STIPULATION OF FACTS 'That on September 21, 1964, petitioners through
the Office of the Agrarian Counsel of San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
made a formal notice and demand to exercise legal redemption over the
above-described parcels of land by means of a tenancy complaint of which respondents
Elena <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> and Real <span class="SpellE">Monasterio</span>
were notified’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said right of le<span style="">g</span>al redemption having been duly
exercised by plaintiffs, it <span style="">is </span>the
duty of the Courts -- if the law invoked by <span style="">plain­tiffs is </span>to be obeyed and not violated -- to protect and implement
the right in question, as prayed for by plaintiffs in their present
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">no defense </span>to the said action 'That the respondent Elena <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> and the other respondent <span style="">Real <span class="SpellE">Mo­nasterio</span> de la </span><span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> de <span class="SpellE">Nuestra</span> Madre Santa Clara de Manila executed on Novem­ber
11 and November 12, 1964, respectively, a pu­blic document denominated
Revocation of Deed of Absolute Sale' (Stipulation of Facts, pr. 10), and not
only because plaintiffs have nothing to do with <span style="">the said </span>revocation but also because <span style="">the said re­vocation came </span>over a month after <span style="">plaintiffs had formally asserted </span>their
right under the law to re­deem the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <span style="">the alleged revocation </span>is anomalous for if there was really no
sale, as claimed by defendants then what was <span style="">there to revoke? </span>If such revocation, as defendants con­tend and
the lower Court in effect ruled, <span style="">is
held to extinguish said </span>plaintiffs right of legal <span style="">redemption, then there </span>could be no
stability in the <span style="">rights of plaintiffs </span>under
said Section 12 of Republic Act <span style="">No.
3844, </span>which is also like setting the <span style="">said sec­tion, </span>if not the said Act, at naught.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Since </span>the
obvious purpose of the alleged revocation is to defeat said Republic Act <span style="">No. 3844, particularly </span><span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> Article 12 thereof, <span style="">the said revocation </span>is void as against public policy, as per
Article 1400 of the new Civil Code which provides pertinently a follows:</blockquote>

by the Deed of Absolute Sale <span style="">executed
by </span>her in<span style=""> </span>favor of her
co-defendant <span style="">on August 4, </span>1964,
and 'That the real, intention and desire of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>

other defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span style="">Real <span class="SpellE">Monasterio</span> is</span> shown by the recitals
in the <span style="">said D</span>eed of Absolute
Sale itself (13-14, Defendants Brief), as well as by paragraphs 5 and 6 of the
STIPULATION OF FACTS show­ing that on <span style="">April </span>24, 1963, said defendant Elena <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> exe<span style="">cuted </span>a
Promise to Donate in favor of her co-defendant, and that pursuant thereto, or June

in fact executed by the donor and accepted by the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>
in a separate Deed of Acceptance of Donation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For one thing, it <span style="">is </span>not easy to believe, as per the said contention of
defendants, that both of them would agree to the execution of the alleged
simulated Deed of Absolute Sale of August 4, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, it is equally difficult to
understand why the real intention of defendant Elena <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>
in the Deed of Absolute Sale of August 4, 1964, just mentioned was to donate
the said property when, according to the STIPULATION OF FACTS, she had already
donated the same to her co-defendant and the latter had already accepted the
same both on June 27 and 28, 1963, respectively (Paragraphs 5 and 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, assuming these transactions between
defendants to be true, their dubious nature cannot but arouse suspicion as to
defendants motivation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, as
plaintiffs had no hand in the said transactions, defendants cannot take
advantage of their own wrong to prejudice plaintiffs’ right under the law to
redeem the said property as already shown.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal by the Corporation, upon the ground that the
Court of Appeals had erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) "in
doubting the existence and validity of the donation of the property in question
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> not­withstanding the
stipulation of facts of the adverse, parties;" (2) "in assuming that
the deed of absolute sale executed by Elena <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>is a
bilateral instrument x <span class="SpellE">x</span> binding upon" the <span style="">Cor­poration; </span>(3) "in imputing
fraud, wrong doing and wrongful moti­vation" to the Corporation; (4)
"in recognizing 'respondents' (te­nants') right of redemption on the basis
of a patently void deed of absolute sale and in applying Section 12 of Republic
Act No. 3844," and (5) "in applying the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> against” the Cor­poration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first four (4) assignments of error are inter-related, for
they refer to different aspects of <span style="">the
same question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They will,
therefore, be considered jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the tenants are lessees and actual
occupants of the property in question; that they were not notified of the
execution of the deed of sale of said property by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>, to the Corporation; and that,
accordingly, the te­nants would be entitled to redeem said property, pursuant
to Sec­tion 12 of Republic Act No. 3844,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
if it had really been sold by <span style="">Miss </span><span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The latter and the Corporation contend, however, that there had
been, in fact, no such sale, despite the execution of the deed of sale of
August 4, 1964, because the property had al­ready been donated by Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> to the Corporation, which had duly accepted the
donation; because, being a unilateral act of Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>,
said deed of sale is not binding upon the Corpora­tion; and because, as stated
by them in their deed of revocation, said deed of sale did not express their
true intent, and, Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> had never received from
the Corporation, or from any other person or entity, the sum of P20,250 stated
in said deed of <span style="">sale as </span>the price actually paid by the Corporation to her as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(a) July 4, 1963 -
P5,000.00; (b) January 4, 1964 - P10,000.00; (c) August 4, 1964 - P5,
250,00."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the determination of the main issue between the parties
herein hinges on whether or not the sale attested to by said deed of sale is
real or fictitious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question is
essen­tially one of <u>fact</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although submitted for decision upon a stipu­lation of facts and the
documents therein mentioned, this case is dependent, <u>not</u> upon the <u>effect</u>
of said documents, taken on their face <span style="">value</span>,
but upon the <u>intention</u> of the parties in connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That intention is, manifestly, a question <u>not</u>
of law, but, of <u>fact</u>, the determination of which narrows the issue to
whether or not the aforementioned deed of revocation should be taken on its
face value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals reached
a negative con­clusion and held that the statements <span style="">made </span>by Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>
and the Corporation in said document are <u>unworthy of credence</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, said deed of revocation is the only evi­dence
negating the existence of a sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
then, said deed of revocation is not conclusive upon the tenants, who are not
parties therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither are the courts
bound to take said instrument on its face <span style="">value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
is more, </span>the lower court found that <u>it could not believe</u> the
statements therein made by Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> and the
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>finding of fact</u>
is conclusive upon us in these proceedings for review on certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, <span style="">in </span>the
light of the surrounding circumstances, we are not prepared to disturb said
finding, for:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> and the Corporation did
not register the deed of "donation" and the deed of acceptance
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If both were meant to be what
they appear to be on their face, the Corporation would have sought the
cancellation of Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson's</span> transfer cer­tificate
of title No. 39775-R and the issuance of another certificate of title in its
own name, <u>as <span class="SpellE">donee</span></u> of the property in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the Corporation did not even
have said "donation" annotated on Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson's</span>
TCT No. 39775-R.</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) Although it did not sign on the deed of sale executed by Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>, there is every reason to believe that the
Corporation knew about it and acquiesced therein, <span style="">as </span>well as cooperated in its enforcement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, said deed of sale was registered, and
Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson's</span> TCT No. 39775-R was cancelled, insofar
as the property in question is concerned, for which TCT No, 42854-R was issued
in the name of the Corporation, <u>by reason of said sale</u>, <u>not</u> in
consequence of the deed of donation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This would not have been possible without the cooperation of the
Corporation, through the non-registration of the aforementioned deeds of
donation and of accep­tance thereof.</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) On November 11 and 12, 1964, the Corporation <u>joined</u>
Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> <span style="">in
</span>the execution of a deed of revocation of said deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Said deed of revocation provided, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, for the can­cellation of said TCT No. 42854-R in the
name of the Corporation</u> and the issuance, in lieu thereof, of another
certificate of title <u>in the name of Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon registration of said deed of revocation,
TCT No. <span style="">42854-R was </span>cancelled to
give way to TCT No. 44076-R, <u>in the name of Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>.</u></p>

<p class="BODY">If she had actually donated the property to the Corporation, and
the latter ad thereby acquired it, as its <span class="SpellE">donee</span>, the
issuance <span style="">of TCT </span>No. 42854-R, in
its name because of the deed of absolute sale, instead of the deed of donation,
could not have possibly injured the Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, however, that both had moral
scruples about appearing on record as having entered into a con­tract of sale,
when there had been no more than a donation, they could have executed a public
document stating that such was the real transaction between them, <u>without
stipulating that the title already in the name of the Corporation would be
cancelled and another one issued in the name of Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This stipulation - which was unnecessary, if
there were no ulterior motives - strongly suggests that the main purpose of
said deed of revocation was <u>to put the property back in the name of Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) On September 21, 1964, or shortly after the execution of the
deed of sale, the tenants gave formal notice of their wish to r<span style="">edeem </span>the property in question,
pursuant to Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the deed of revocation, executed
subse<span style="">que</span>ntly to said notice,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> the title to said property reverted to its original
owner, Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>, <u>thus preparing the ground or
the <span style="">defense</span></u><span style=""> set </span>up by her and the Corporation in
the trial court, namely, that “there is <u>no more right of redemption</u> to
exercise, <u>the property having<span style="">&nbsp; </span>been
restored to the former owner thereof</u>,” in the language of Ms Honor the
Trial Judge.</p>

<p class="NUM">(5) The existence of the ulterior motives adverted <span style="">to above is </span>deducible from the deed of
revocation, which provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>“That this covenant shall be without prejudice to the execution of
whatever deeds, documents and/or covenants which will contain and reflect the
real in­tention or desire of the parties herein regarding the aforementioned
parcels of land, that the <span style="">PURPORTED
VENDOR</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style=""> </span>hereby still binds herself <span style="">to whatever commi</span>tments <span style="">she </span>may have made to and in favor of
the PURPORTED VENDEE<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> in
connection with the afore­mentioned parcels of land,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, after the title had been restored to the original
owner, Miss <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span> - and, after the defense that
there is, therefore, nothing to redeem<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> has been
availed of - she and the Corporation would execute such covenants as would
"reflect<span style=""> </span>the real intention
or desire" of both she and the Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The necessity of executing such covenant
implies, not only that the deed of revocation did not state everything they
wanted and intended to do, but, also, that neither did the deed of donation and
the deed of acceptance thereof express their "real intention or
desire." Otherwise, they could simply file both deeds the Register of
Deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the non-registration
thereof is a clear indication that they do not reflect such intention.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first four (4) assignments of error are, therefore, clearly
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the fourth assignment of error, it is,
likewise, urged that the Court of Appeals erred in recognizing the right of the
tenants to redeem <span style="">the </span>property in
question, with an area of 29.45 hectares, for the sum of P20,250.00:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) because the aggregate area "actually
cultivated" by the tenants is 22.8 hectares, and Section 12 of Republic
Act No. 3844 grants to them the right of redemption "only to the extent of
the area actually cul­tivated by them"; and (2) because, pursuant to said
provision, the redemption shall be made "at a reasonable price and
consideration", and there is no evidence thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first objection cannot be sustained for said Section 12
explicitly provides "that the <u>entire</u> landholding <u>must be</u>
redeemed.” The proviso therein, to the effect "that where there are two or
more agricultural lessees, each shall be entitled to said right of redemption
only to the extent of the area actually cultivated by him," merely seeks
to forestall conflicts <u>between said lessees</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It means that a tenant-lessee cannot exercise
the right of redemp­tion with respect to a portion held by another tenant-<span class="SpellE">leasee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> or the buyer has <u>no</u> right whatsoever in
connection there­with, this being a matter that concerns <u>exclusively</u> the
tenants-lessees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case like the
present, when the property redeemed is somewhat bigger than the area actually
cultivated by each lessee, the division of the excess <u>among the tenants</u>
will have to be settled, either by mutual agreement between them, or in
appropriate judi­cial proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">sec</span>ond
objection<span style=""> is w</span>ell taken, no proof
having <span style="">been in­troduced on </span>the
"reasonable price" of the property in <span style="">question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Such price </span>should
be determined by the trial court, after due <span style="">notice to the parties </span>and hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fifth assignment of error is premised upon <span style="">the fact </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the </span>Corporation was not a party to the deed of sale <span style="">executed by </span><span style="">Mis</span><span style="">s <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As </span>above indicated, the Corporation had, <span style="">however, cooperated </span>with her in enforcing said deed, by the <span style="">registration </span><span style="">thereof, <u>in lieu of </u></span><u>the deed
of donation and the deed of </u><u><span style="">acceptance
</span><span style="">thereof</span></u><span style="">- which the Corporation refrained from filing
with</span> <span style="">the Register of </span>Deeds
- and the issuance of TCT <span style="">No. </span><span style="">42854-R in the name of the Corporation, upon
the </span>partial cancellation of Miss <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pecson</span></span>'<span style=""> s TCT No. </span>39775-R, and other acts and declaration already <span style="">adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Furthermore in view of the other attending circums<span style="">tances, the result would </span>be the same, <span style="">even </span>if we discarded the principle <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
decision appealed from is hereby <span style="">affirmed,
