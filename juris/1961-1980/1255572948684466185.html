				<H3>DOLORES EVANGELISTA, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. THE MUNICIPALITY OF PAOMBONG AND HON. FLORENCIO MORENO, AS SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Dolores Evangelista and the other petitioners inherited from the deceased 
spouses Eugenio Evangelista and Petronia Lim, a parcel of registered land 
converted into a fishpond located in sitio Mariablo, Paombong, Bulacan. On July 
14, 1948, the municipal council of said municipality, pursuant to Section 2 of 
Republic Act No. 2056, passed Resolution No. 94, Series of 1958, amended by 
Resolution No. 118 of August 28, 1958, requesting the Department of Agriculture 
and Natural Resources to order the investigation of the boundaries of fishponds 
found within the municipality to ascertain whether portions oi navigable rivers 
and creeks were included therein.
<p>Acting upon the resolution mentioned above, the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications—to whom, apparently the same was referred—notified petitioners 
that an investigation and ocular inspection of their fishpond would be conducted 
to verify the location of a navigable stream known as Estero Kaylaki.</p>
<p>While said investigation was pending, petitioners filed a petition for 
certiorari, with preliminary injunction, with the Court of First Instance of 
Bulacan (Civil Case No. 1968) against the Municipality of Paombong and the 
Secretary of Public Works and Communications to prevent the latter from 
proceeding with the investigation, on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to 
review the decision of, and decree issued by the Court of First Instance of 
Bulacan in Registration Proceedings No. 533 declaring the late Evangelista 
spouses the owners of the fishpond subject-matter thereof and that the "Estero 
Kaylaki" was not included in said fishpond.</p>
<p>After due trial, the Court rendered its decision dismissing the petition and 
dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction theretofore issued. Hence 
petitioners' present appeal on purely questions of law.</p>
<p>On August 16, 1961, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss the case on the 
ground that the same had become academic by reason of the decision of the 
Secretary of Public Works and Communications dated May 15, 1961 dismissing the 
complaint filed against them upon a finding that they had not encroached on any 
portion of the Estero Kaylaki.</p>
<p>Commenting on the motion to dismiss the case, respondents submit that 
petitioner's appeal—not the case—should be dismissed.</p>
<p>As adverted to above, what is before us is an appeal from the decision of the 
Court of First Instance of Bulacan dismissing Civil Case No. 1968. Said appeal, 
therefore, is what should be dismissed, so that, in view thereof, the vacated 
decision shall be revived.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appeal is dismissed, without costs. </p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, 
</em>and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
