				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review by way of <i>certiorari</i> of the
Decision of the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as its Resolution denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsi­deration<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised by petitioner is whether or not there was a
valid service of summons upon him as to bring him within the jurisdiction of
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records extant in this case demonstrate that for failure of
petitioner who is the defendant in Civil Case No. 17853 of the Court of First
Instance of Rizal to answer the complaint against him, he was declared in
default and plaintiff in said case allowed to present his evidence <u>ex-parte</u>
after which the court rendered its decision, dated August 16, 1973, the
dispositive portion of which reads thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">IN VIEW </span>OF ALL THE
FOREGOING, decision is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against <span style="">the </span>defendant, condemning the
defendant to pay unto the plaintiff the amount of P5,796.00 for underpayment;
P3,648.00 for overtime pay and the sum of P970.00 as separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant shall likewise pay the amount
of P500.00 as attorney's fees plus the costs of this proceedings.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a Motion to Set Aside Judgment by Default and/or for New Trial
dated September 3, 1973, defendant (now petitioner herein), alleged that he
learned of the filing of the complaint against him for the first time only on
August 27, 1973 when he was notified of the court's decision and that he failed
to answer the com­plaint because he was <u>never served with summons</u> issued
in this case in the manner required by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant further pointed out that as a consequence of his non-receipt
of the summons, he had been unjustly deprived of his <u>day in court</u> which
materially affects or impairs his substantial rights; that he has a good and
meritorious defense to the complaint which, if allowed to be presented, would
most probably alter the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further,
he contends that if the allegation of the plaintiff that he was employed as
guard and in charge of the San Juan Bodega mentioned in the complaint is
correct, defendant would not be the real party in interest responsible for
plaintiff's employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant,
however, clarifies that the truth of the matter is that plaintiff, admit­tedly
"an old and unlettered man" unsuitable as a guard, together with his
wife and a married son who has a child, merely asked for and was given
permission to live on the subject premises (with an area of approximately 1-1/2
hectares) where they could raise vegetable crops primarily to prevent squatters
nearby from occupying the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he
pleaded that the decision of the trial court dated August 16, 1973 be set aside
and that he be given opportunity to cross-examine plaintiff on matters
testified to during the <u>ex-parte</u> hearing and thereafter to present his
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court denied the Motion to Set Aside Judgment by
Default and/or for New Trial, finding it to be not well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on October 1, 1973, defendant thru
counsel, manifested his intention to appeal from the adverse decision dated
August 16, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no
opposition to the Record on Appeal filed by defendant Aurelio Litonjua, the
same was approved and the case was forwarded to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, defendant-appellant gave three assignment of
errors, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT
DEFENDANT WAS NEVER DULY SERVED WITH SUMMONS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT
FINDING THAT THE PLEADINGS AND EVIDENCE ON RECORD DO NOT MAKE OUT A CASE
AGAINST DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING
DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S "MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT AND/OR FOR
NEW TRIAL."</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant-appellant's appeal was decided adversely against him,
the respondent Court of Appeals finding the judgment appealed from to be in
accordance with law and the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this petition, both
the petitioner and the private respondent agree that the issue for resolution
is whether or not there was valid service of summons upon the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner strongly asserts that he was
never duly served with summons resulting </span>in denial of due process and of
his day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court of
Appeals citing the case of <u>Montalban v. Maximo</u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
maintains that there was valid service of summons as service on the cashier of
the E &amp; L Realty Co., Mr. Rodolfo Pamintuan, was reasonably calculated to
give the defendant actual notice of the proceedings and was, therefore,
sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that Mr. Rodolfo Pamintuan
who executed an affidavit of merit annexed to petitioner's "Motion to Set
Aside Order of Default and/or For New Trial," manifested that sometime in
June, 1973 he recalls that a Sheriff of the City of Manila went to the E &amp;
L Building where he was working as Cashier of the E &amp; L Realty Co., looking
for Mr. Aurelio Litonjua in order to <span style="">serve </span>the summons issued in the civil case
filed against him by Mr. Tarcelo Peñaranda; that he informed the Sheriff that
Mr. Aurelio Litonjua, who is already old, seldom goes to the office due to poor
health and that he could be found at his residence at 1536 Princeton St., Wack
Wack Subdivision, Mandaluyong, <span style="">Rizal;
that </span>when the Sheriff asked him to accept the summons and sign for such
receipt in behalf <span style="">of </span>defendant,
he refused, informing him that he was not authorized to do so; further, that he
refused to accept the summons because he personally knew that the subject
premises where plaintiff was allegedly employed as guard is actually owned by
Eddie Steamship (Phil.), Inc. in which defendant has no connection whatsoever.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find merit in
petitioner's case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the case
of <u>Montalban v. Maximo</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is not in point as said case ruled that a
suit in <u>personam</u> against a resident of the Philippines <u>temporarily
absent</u> therefrom may be validly effected by substituted service under
Section 8, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In said case, the question of primary importance which necessarily
involved an inquiry into procedural due process was whether summons in a <u>suit
in personam against a resident of the Philippines</u> tempora­rily absent
therefrom may be validly effected by substi­tuted service under Section 8, Rule
14 of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs therein themselves argued that if the ordinary method
prescribed by the rules, that is <u>personal service</u> under Section 7, Rule
14, was not feasible, then the substituted service </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Section 8, aforesaid came into play.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court accordingly held that since <u>personal service</u> was <u>impossible</u>
because of therein defendant's absence from the country, resort to substi­tuted
service became a necessity.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from a perusal of the records <span style="">of </span>the case at bar that respondent's
suit is one <u><span style="">in personam</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">against
petitioner (defendant) Aurelio Litonjua.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, service of summons should be in accordance with Section 7 of Rule
14 of the Revised Rules of Court which underscores the need for the summons to be
served by handing a copy thereof to the defendant in person, or, if he refuses
to receive it, by tendering it to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Substituted service should be availed of only when the defendant cannot
be served promptly in person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Impossibility of prompt ser­vice should be shown by stating the efforts
made to find the defendant personally and the failure of such efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement should be made in the proof of
service.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the manner of service as reflected in the Record on Appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
was "service thru Miss Rudy Pamin­tuan, who (however) refused to sign the
receipt hereof but tender the same." There is no showing that efforts were
made to serve the summons personally <span style="">upon
</span>defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the defendant could
not be served <span style="">personally </span>with
summons within a reasonable time, substituted service may be availed of and may
be effected by either of these two modes:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's dwelling house
or usual residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then
residing therein, or (2) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular
place of business with some competent person in charge thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the sheriff who served the summons immediately resorted to
substituted service by leaving the summons with the cashier of the E &amp; L
Realty Co. who cannot be said to be the competent person in charge of the
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cashier refused to accept
the copies but instead disclosed the correct address or residence of defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But notwithstanding the information of
defendant's where­abouts, the sheriff proceeded to tender the summons upon the
cashier instead of essaying to personally serve the same upon defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the advanced facilities of
transportation and communication, it would have been such an easy matter for
him to have gone to defendant's residence at Mandaluyong, Rizal or he could <span style="">have easily </span>availed of telephone
facilities to determine the correct­ness of defendant's address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not adopt any such measure to
personally get in touch with defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It thus becomes apparent
that the sheriff was in such haste to effect the service of summons and such
apparent haste also made manifest from his action </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">immediately making a return of the summons on the same date (June 26,
1973) he made substituted service to the cashier of the E &amp; L Realty Co.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, despite the fact that the alleged
substituted service was wrongfully effected since he was duly informed that
defendant because of old age hardly went to said office of E &amp; L Realty Co.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since summons is the writ
by which the defendant is notified of the action against him and since the
service of such writ is the means by which the court acquires jurisdiction over
his person, the conclusion that comes to the fore is that since the summons was
not validly effected, the court acquired no jurisdiction over the person of
petitioner (defendant) Aurelio Liton­jua, and the judgment against him must
perforce be nugatory and without legal effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, </span>the <span style="">Court in the
recent case of <u>Dultra v. the Court of First Instance of Agusan, et al</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> held on precisely the same issue of whether
an invalid summons confers jurisdiction over the person of a defendant, that </span>since
<span style="">the defendants therein had not been
properly summoned, the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction over them; that
such court had no right or power to render judgment against them in an action <u>in
personam</u>; and that its judgment against them was void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that the issue in this case
is also whether the Dultra spouses had been duly served with summons or whether
the lower court had acquired jurisdiction over them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In still another case, <u>Delta
Motor Sales Corpo­ration v. Mangosing, et al</u>.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Court likewise ruled that the trial
court did not acquire jurisdiction over therein petitioner-defendant because it
had not been properly served with summons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the order of default, the judgment by default and the
execution issued by the trial court were held to be void and were set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, petitioner asseverates that <span style="">he was not properly served with summons and
consequently, the judgment by default rendered against him should be set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The case of <u>Tumambing v. Ganzon</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> wherein </span><span style="">We </span><span style="">reaffirmed the leading
case of <u>Coombs v. Santos, 24 Phil. 466</u>, (where a motion </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">set aside the order of default </span>was <span style="">denied by the trial court but granted by this Court) fully supports
petitioner's case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A default judgment does not pretend to be based upon the
merits of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its existence
is justified <span style="">on </span>the ground that
it is the one final expedient to induce the defendant to join issue upon the
allegations tendered by the plaintiff, and to do so without unnecessary
delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment by default may amount
to a positive and considerable injustice to the defendant; and the possibility
of such serious consequences necessitates a careful examination of the grounds
upon which the defendant asks that it be set aside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Watson vs. R. R. Co. (41 Cal., 17, 20), the court
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Applications of this character are
addressed to the discretion -- the legal discretion -- of the court in which
the default has occured, and should be disposed of by it as substantial justice
may seem to require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each case must be
determined upon its own peculiar facts, for perhaps no two cases will be found
to present the same circumstances for consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, however, in cases where,
as here, the application is made so immediately after default entered as that
no considerable delay <span style="">to </span>the
plaintiff is to be occasioned by permitting a defense on the merits, the courts
ought to incline to relieve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
exercise of the mere <span style="">discretion of the
court ought to tend in a reasonable degree, at least, to bring about a judgment
on the very merits of the case; and when the circumstances are such as to lead
the court to hesitate upon the motion to open the default, it is better, as a
general rule, that the doubt should be resolved in favor of the application.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It might be added that if plaintiff relies upon his judgment
obtained by default and directs the attention of the court to no real injury
which would result to his interests by the re­opening of the case, his
objection to such action assumes, to say the least, the appearance of a
technicality, which, in this liberal age, is not looked upon with favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the authorities shows that
where the application to set aside a default judgment is made immediately
following its entry, it will receive much greater consideration than where a
delay of months or even <span style="">weeks has
occured."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the order of default, judgment by
default and other proceedings in Civil Case No. 17853 below are set aside and
the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings and trial and
determination on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
