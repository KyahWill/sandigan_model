				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The spouses Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Quiñanola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabio</span> (respondents
herein) commenced Civil Case No. 3066 in the Court of First Instance of
Oriental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> against the spouses <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Otilla</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> (petitioners
herein) to consolidate their owner­ship over two parcels of land subject matter
of a deed of <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sale executed in their
favor, claiming that the <span class="SpellE">Quijanos</span>, vendors a retro,
had failed to exercise their right to repurchase within the period agreed upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, the defendants alleged that the
transaction subject matter of the action was a mere equitable mortgage and
that, in fact, it was a devise to cover up a usurious loan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the trial of the case, however, the parties arrived at a
Compromise Agreement dated <u>February 7, 1956</u> and submitted it to the
Court on <u>February 9, 1956</u> for corresponding action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this latter date, the Court rendered
decision as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"DECISION</p>

<blockquote>When this case was called for hearing, the parties submitted an
agreement in the following tenor:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiffs grant unto the Defendants
a period of EIGHT (8) MONTHS from date hereof within which to repurchase the
two (2) parcels of land involved in this litigation in the sum of EIGHT
THOUSAND FIVE HUN­DRED TWENTY-SEVEN PESOS (P8,527.00), Philippine Currency;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That all expenses incident to Defendants'
exercise of their right to repurchase, shall be for Defendants' account;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the Plaintiffs shall become the absolute
owners of the two (2) parcels of land involved in this litigation, upon
Defendants failure to exercise their right to repurchase within the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> period of EIGHT (8) MONTHS;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That with this COMPROMISE AGREE­MENT, the
Defendants agree to have their counterclaim against the Plaintiffs, dismissed;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the parties hereby confirm the fact of
the two (2) parcels of land involved in this litigation as the <span class="SpellE">para­phernal</span> property of defendant OTILLA SEVILLA as stated
in a DEED OF SALE WITH RIGHT OF REPURCHASE, Annex 'A' to the complaint;</p>

<blockquote>IN VIEW THEREOF, Judgment is hereby ren­dered conformably to its
terms and conditions without any pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 9, 1956, or exactly eight months from the date of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> judgment by compromise, the defendants
deposited with the Clerk of Court the sum of P7<span class="GramE">,670.00</span>
under Official Receipt No. 2277340, while the sum of P857.00 needed to complete
the repurchase price was remitted on the same date to said officer by money
order and registered mail, for which Official Receipt No. 2277346 was issued on
October 13, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When tender of the
amount was made, the plaintiffs refused to accept it and to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the land to the vendors, claiming that the period <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
had already expired when the repurchase money was delivered to the Clerk of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view there­of, the defendants,
on <st1:date year="1956" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1956</st1:date>, filed
a motion for the confirmation of the repurchase made as above stated and to
require the plaintiffs to execute the cor­responding deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
February 27, the lower court issued an order granting said motion as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the deposit made which represents the
total amount of the redemption money with the Clerk of Court, from whom they
could withdraw it, valid, the plaintiffs are ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
and restitute the property in question to the defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the plaintiffs perfected an appeal from said order to
the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter court,
on <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1963</st1:date> rendered
judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the order <u>a quo</u> of February 27, 1957 is
set aside; the defendants' motion of October 23, 1956 for confirmation of
redemption of the two parcels in litigation and for the restitution thereof to
them is hereby denied; the defendants having failed to re­purchase the parcel
on time the plaintiffs are hereby declared the absolute owners there­of; and we
hereby order the consolidation of ownership of the parcels in the plaintiffs,
and their registration in the names of the plaintiffs in the Registry of
Property of the province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review by certiorari filed in due
time by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question now to be determined is whether or not the repurchase
was made within the stipulated period of eight months.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no denying of the fact that the compromise agreement
provides that the repurchase should be effected within "a period of EIGHT
(8) MONTHS from date hereof within which to repurchase the two (2) parcels of
land involved in this litigation", nor is there any dispute as to the fact
that said agreement was executed on February 7, 1956 while the payment of the
repurchase price was made on October 9, 1956 - exactly eight months from the
date when the judgment by compromise was rendered but two days after the date
of execution of the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Technically, the decision of the Court of Appeals is correct, but
consider­ing that the vendors a retro were obviously acting in good faith under
the impression that, notwithstanding the cold letter of the agreement, it was
the date of the judgment rendered by the Court that was to control the period
of the re­purchase, and considering the further fact that there is no claim or
pretense that the buyers a retro had suffered pre­judice of any kind because of
the two days delay in making the repurchase, We are of the opinion that the
provisions of Article 1234 of the New Civil Code should apply to the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts before <span class="GramE">Us</span> leave no room for doubt that the obligors have
substantially performed in good faith their obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, what they did must be deemed to be
"a strict and complete fulfillment" of their obligation under the compromise
agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed and
another is hereby rendered restoring and/or affirming the order appealed from
issued by the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
