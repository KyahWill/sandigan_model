petitioner Mindanao Portland Cement Corporation and respondent McDonough

</span>of <st1:state><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:state>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
executed a contract<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for the construction by the respondent for the <span style="">petitioner of </span>a dry Portland cement plant at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a separate contract, Turnbull, Inc. - the

supervise the construction, schedule deliveries and the construction work as
well as check and certify all contractors' progress and fiscal requests for
payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alterations in the plans and specifications were subsequently
made during the progress of the construction as set forth in Addenda 2 to 8
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to this and to other causes
deemed sufficient by Turnbull, Inc., extensions of time<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for the termination of the project, initially agreed to be finished on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1961</st1:date>, <span style="">were </span>granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent finally completed the project on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1962</st1:date>, except as to <span style="">delivery </span>of certain spare parts for
replacements and installation of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">floodlamps</span></span><span style="">; and on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="11"><span style="">November
 </span><span style="">14,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">these latter items were
complied with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the Addenda in the plans and specifications, Addenda <span style="">2, 3 </span>and <span style="">7 </span>were not signed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">altho</span> <span style="">the </span>same
were forwarded to it, after having been signed by respondent; these are still

<p class="BODY">Differences later arose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner claimed from respondent damages in the amount of more than
P2,000,000 allegedly occasioned by the delay in the project's com­pletion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent in turn asked for more than
P450,000 from petitioner for alleged <u>losses due to cost of extra work and
overhead as of April 1962</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
conference was held <span style="">on </span>or about <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1962</st1:date> between petitioner and
Turnbull, Inc., on one hand, and respondent on the other, to settle the
differences aforementioned, but no satisfactory results were reached.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner sent respondent, on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="8">August <span style="">8, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>and again on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1962</st1:date>, written invitations to arbi­trate,
invoking a provision in their contract regarding arbitration of disputes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Instead of answering said
invitations, respondent, </span>on <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1962</st1:date>, with Turnbull, Inc.'s approval, sub­mitted to petitioner
for payment its final statement of work accomplished, asking for P403,700 as <u>unpaid
balance of the consideration of the contract</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, on <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="1">January
 29, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>filed the present action in the
Court of First Instance of Manila to com­pel respondent to arbitrate with it
concerning alleged disputes arising from their contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It averred <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that deletions and additions to the plans and specifications were agreed upon
during the progress of the construction; that disagreement arose between them
as to the cost of the additional or extra work done, and respondent's
deviations from some agreed specifications; that petitioner claims having
overpaid respondent by P33,810.81; that petitioner further claims to have suf­fered
damages due to respondent's delay in finishing the project; that respondent, on
the other hand, still claims <span style="">an </span>unpaid
balance of about P403,700; that these matters fall under the general
arbitration clause of their con­tract; and that respondent has failed to
proceed to arbi­tration despite several requests <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent filed, on <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="2">February
 23, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>its answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It denied the alleged existence of
disagreement between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as
special defense, it alleged that its claim for P403,700 was not disputed and
that the respec­tive claims for damages should be resolved by Turnbull, Inc.,
pursuant to the exception in the arbitration clause of the construction
contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">After stipulation of facts and submission of documentary
evidence, the court, on May <span style="">13, 1964, </span>rendered
its decision finding that dispute or disagreement obtained between the parties
with respect to their rights and obligations under their contract and that the
same should be submitted to arbitration pursuant to par. <span style="">39 </span>of said contract - the arbitration
clause - and to Republic Act <span style="">876 - </span>the
Arbitration Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thus it ordered
petitio­ner and respondent to proceed to arbitration in accor­dance with the
terms of their contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the ruling, respondent appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to Us to raise the purely legal question of
whether under these facts respondent is duty-bound to submit to arbitration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of the contract on "Arbitration of Dis­agreements"
(par. <span style="">39) says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"39.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In the event of disagreement between
the Owner and the Contractor in respect of the rights or obligations of either
of the par­ties hereunder <u>except the interpretation of the plans and
specifications and ques­tions concerning the sufficiency of materials, the
time, sequence and method of performing the work, which questions are to be
finally determined </u><u><span style="">by </span>the
</u><u><span style="">Engineer</span></u><span style="">, </span>they shall
submit the matter to <span style="">arbitration, </span>the
Owner choosing one arbitrator, the Contractor one, and the two so chosen shall
select a third.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of such
arbitrators or a majority of them shall be made in writing to both parties and
when so made shall be binding upon the par­ties hereto."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent, herein
appellant, contends first, that </span>there is no showing of disagreement; and
second, that if there is, the same falls under the exception, to be resolved by
the engineer.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the first point, the fact of disagreement has been
determined by the court below upon the stipulation of facts and documentary
evidence submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this appeal
involving pure questions of law, the above finding should not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the existence of disagreement is
plainly shown in the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
admits the existence of petitioner's <span style="">claim </span>but denies its <span style="">m</span>erit.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It likewise admits that petitioner has refused to <span style="">pay </span>its claim for the unpaid balance of the price of the <span style="">contract.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Paragraph <span style="">8 </span>of the stipulation of facts shows the dispute of the parties
regarding their mutual <span style="">claims and that
said dispute remained unsettled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"8. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>That on or about May 29, 1962, a
conference was held between petitioner and Turnbull, Inc., on the one hand, and
respondent, on the other, <u><span style="">to settle
their differences involving the claim for damages of petitioner in the amount
of more than P2,000,000</span></u><span style="">,</span>
occasioned by the delay in the completion of the project, <u><span style="">and the claim of respondent for losses due to
the cost of extra plant and overhead in the amount of more than P</span></u><u><span style="">45</span></u><u><span style="">0,000</span></u><span style="">, </span>as of
April, 1962, <u><span style="">but no satisfactory
results were reached</span></u><span style="">;" </span>(Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the second point, the parties agreed by way of
exception that disagreements with respect to the following matters shall be
finally resolved by the engineer, instead of being submitted to
arbitration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The interpretation of
plans and specifications; (2) sufficiency of materials; and <span style="">(3) </span>the time, sequence and method of
performing the work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The disputes involved here, on the other hand, are <span style="">on </span>(1) the proper computation of the
total contract <span style="">price,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>including the cost of additional or
extra works;<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">and (2) </span>the <span style="">liability </span>for alleged delay in
completing the project and for <span style="">alleged </span>losses
due to change in the plans and specifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now from the contract itself We can determine the scope of the
exceptions <span style="">aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, pars. </span>19 to 22 of <span style="">its </span>General Conditions deal with the
subject "Interpretation of Plans and Specifications".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, the
engineer is empowered to <u>correct</u> all discre­<span style="">pancies, </span>errors or omissions in the plans and<span style=""> </span>specifica­<span style="">tions; </span>to <u><span style="">explain</span></u><span style=""> </span>all
doubts that may arise thereon; and to <u>furnish</u> further plans and
specifications as may be req<span style="">uired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No </span>mention is made therein as to the <u>cost</u>
of the project; this matter is covered by the <span style="">engineering </span>contract, under which Turnbull, Inc.'s function is <span style="">li</span>mited to making <u><span style="">estimates</span></u><span style=""> </span>of costs only.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Sufficiency of materials" and "method of perform­<span style="">ing </span>the work" - under the second
and third exceptions abovementioned - are treated in pars. 2 to <span style="">6 </span>of the General Conditions under the
heading "QUALITY OF WORKS AND MATERIALS".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turnbull, Inc., is therein empowered to
determine the <u>amount</u>, <u>quality</u>, <u>acceptability</u> and <u>fitness</u>
<span style="">of </span>the <span style="">several kinds </span>of work and materials furnished and to reject or
condemn any of them which, in its opinion, does not fully conform to the terms
of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case,
the dispute is not as to the quality of the materials or of the kind of work
done.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Time" and "Sequence of Work" are covered by
pars. <span style="">9 </span>to 17 of the General
Conditions under the heading "SCHE­DULING".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither would the disputes fall under these
ex­ceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turnbull, Inc.'s power here
is to schedule the deliveries and construction work and expedite the same so
that the project can be finished on time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also au­thorized, under par. 15, to determine whether any even­tuality
is sufficient enough to warrant an extension of time and if so, to determine
the period of such extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay
envisioned here is one that occurs during the progress of the work which
disturbs the pre-scheduling plan, thus necessitating an extension of the
over-all dead­line precisely to prevent respondent from going beyond the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turnbull, Inc.'s function goes no
further than to calculate and fix the period of extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the delay petitioner alleged is
different:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it is delay beyond the last
date of extension fixed by Turnbull, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clear­ly, the question of liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is not embraced in the exception.</p>

<p class="BODY">To none of the exceptions then do the disagreements in question
belong; the rule of arbitration therefore ap­plies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties in fact also stipulated in their
con­tract, under "EXTRA WORK", that the cost of extra work to be paid
shall be subject to negotiation.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This negates the proposition that Turnbull, Inc.'s cost estimates ap­pearing in
Addenda 2, <span style="">3 </span>and <span style="">7 </span>are final and conclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason, moreover, for the exceptions - interpre­tation of
plans and specifications; sufficiency of mate­rials; sequence, time and method
of performing the work - is the need to decide these matters immediately, since
the progress of the work would await their determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is not true as to matters relating
to the liabi­lity for delay in the project's completion; these are ques­tions
that the engineer does not have to resolve before the project can go on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, We view that it is not included
in the exceptions, as indeed the related provisions of their agreement
indicate.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since there obtains herein a written provision for arbitration <span style="">as </span>well as
failure on respondent's part to comply therewith, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
rightly ordered the par<span style="">ties </span>to
proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of their agreement (Sec. 6,
Republic Act 876).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Res­pondent's
arguments touching upon the merits of the dis­pute are improperly raised
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should be ad­dressed to the
arbitrators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proceeding is merely a
summary remedy to enforce the agreement to arbitrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty of the court in this case is not to
resolve the merits of the parties’ <span style="">claims
</span>but only to determine if they should proceed to arbitration or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">altho</span> it has
been ruled that a frivolous or patently baseless claim should not be ordered to
arbitration, it is also re­cognized that the mere fact that a defense <span style="">exists against </span>a claim does not make
it frivolous or baseless.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from, ordering the
parties to proceed to arbitration according to the terms of their agreement, is
hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
