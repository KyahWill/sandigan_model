Roberto S. Benedicto, <span style="">as </span>Consultant
on Legal Matters,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
with respondent Conrado E. <span style="">Medina being
assigned to his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
petitioner would seek to nullify the above resolution and enjoin its
enforcement, his action is essentially one of quo warranto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its </span><span style="">success </span><span style="">is thus
dependent on his being able to sustain the burden of demonstrating that what
was done by respondent Bank, through </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">Board of Directors,
all of whom were likewise named respondents, could in law be characterized as a
removal with­out cause contrary to the explicit mandate of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he was not able to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition must fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was appointed on July 12, 1962 as
Chief Legal Counsel of respondent Bank with the rank of Vice-President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 20, 1966, a letter-directive was
issued by the then President of the Bank, respondent Benedicto, that he was
transferred to his office as Consultant on Legal Matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The justification for such a move was Resolution
No. 1053 of respondent Board of Directors of the Bank, wherein it was expressly
stated "that Vice President Tomas Besa be shifted to the Office of the
President as Consultant on Legal Matters, without change in salary and other
privileges."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on October 24, 1966, petitioner, in a letter
addressed to the respondent Board of Directors and respondent President
Benedicto, sought a reconsideration of the action above taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under date of October 27, 1966, the Secretary
of respondent Board of Directors advised petitioner of the denial of his motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the aforesaid
letter-directive of October 20, 1966, respondent Conrado E. Medina was
designated Vice-President and Chief Legal Counsel effective as of that day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, respondents admitted the above facts and stressed
that respondent Medina far from usurping the position of petitioner "is
Vice President and Chief Legal Counsel of the respondent Bank who has assumed
office and discharged the duties thereof starting October 20, 1966 by virtue of
a valid appointment extended to him by the respondent Board of Directors and a
letter-directive issued pursuant thereto by respondent PNB President Roberto S.
Benedicto."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The action taken in the case of petitioner was explained thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The transfer of petitioner from the Legal
Department is further justified by the following facts and circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) The position of Chief Legal Counsel
carries a special confidential relationship of lawyer and client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the Bank has the prerogative
to designate or change its lawyer, that is, to choose the lawyer, in whom it
may have confidence, to head its Legal Department; b) As a matter of fact, <span style="">it was on this same principle <span style="">of confidence that in 1962 the </span>petitioner,
who was then an outsider (private practitioner), was appointed as Vice
President and Chief <span style="">Legal Counsel by </span>the
transfer of Atty. Ramon B. de los Reyes, who was then head (for twenty-one
years) of the Legal Department, <span style="">to a </span>new
position of Technical Assistant to the Executive Vice President, with only the
rank of Assistant <span style="">Vice President; </span>c)
The transfer of petitioner from </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">Legal Department was made by the
respondent Board, in the exercise <span style="">of
its </span>powers upon the recommendation of the <span style="">respondent PNB President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>respondent
Board had authorized the <span style="">PNB President
to revitalize the Legal Department, * </span>* *."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As was made clear at the
outset, the <span style="">law is </span></span><span style="">not </span><span style="">on the </span><span style="">side of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His plea cannot be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's reliance on
the constitutional provision against removal without cause <span style="">is misplaced. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is appropriate to </span>invoke it when an
officer or employee <span style="">in the civil
service </span>enjoying a fixed term is made to lose his position without
warrant or justification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly
finds no application when the duration of one's term depends on the will of the
appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is so where the
position held is <span style="">highly </span>confidential
in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the case of the
Chief Legal Counsel of respondent Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">is </span>our answer to the specific question
before <span style="">us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decision is </span>limited to the
validity of the action taken by respondent Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not by any means intimate an opinion <span style="">as </span>to the <span style="">legal </span>consequences attaching to an
action <span style="">similar in character taken by
any o</span>ther office or agency of the <span style="">government concerning a </span>lawyer in its staff, especially one who<span style=""> was not employed </span>precisely because of
the marked d<span style="">egree of confidence reposed
in him, </span>but rather because of his technical competence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as the petitioner <span style="">is
concerned, however, it is o</span>ur conclusion that he could not plausibly
contend that there was a removal in the constitutional sense as what did take
place was a termination of official relation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accepting as he did the position of chief legal <span style="">adviser, </span>the essence of <span style="">which
is the utmost degree of confidence involving such "close intimacy which
insures freedom of intercourse without embarrassment or freedom from misgivings
of betrayals" whether of personal trust or official matters,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> he could not have been unaware that his term
could be cut short any time without giving rise to any alleged infringement of
the above constitutional safe­guard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no removal which according to such a mandate is only allowable
for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the lack of persuasive
character of petitioner's plea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was set forth with precision and clarity by the
present Chief Justice in a recent decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus: "This should not be misunderstood as denying that the incumbent of a
primarily confidential position holds office at the pleasure only of the
appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted,
however, that when such pleasure turns into displeasure, the incumbent is <u>not</u>
'removed' or 'dismissed' from office — his 'term' merely '<u>expires</u>', in
much the same way as an officer, whose right thereto ceases upon expiration of
the fixed term for which he had been appointed or elected, is <u>not</u> and
can <u>not</u> be deemed '<u>removed</u>' or '<u>dismissed</u>' therefrom, upon
the expiration of said term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main
difference between the former — the primarily confidential officer — and the
latter is that the latter's term is fixed <span style="">or
</span>definite, whereas that of the former is not pre­fixed, but indefinite,
at the time of his appointment or election, and becomes fixed and determined
when the appointing power expresses its decision to put an end to the services
of the in­cumbent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this event takes
place, the latter is not '<u>removed</u>' or '<u>dismissed</u>' from office —
his term has merely '<u>expired</u>'."</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in his
memorandum apparently was encouraged by the long, unbroken, unquestioned course
of impressive adjudi­cation of this Court that has given a well-nigh
all-embracing scope to the mantle of protection covering civil service
personnel against removal without cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it has been from Lacson v. Romero<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to the above-cited Ingles v. Mutuc decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
So, it is to be expected, it would continue to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's cause did not thereby gain
ground however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as had just been
made clear, there was in his case no question of removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The excerpts cited by him from a few of the
authoritative precedents thus do not commend themselves for their pertinence or
relevance.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is a question raised by petitioner in his memorandum
though, unfortunately not given the fullness of attention devoted to the
removal aspect, which deserves to be further looked into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the mode of inviting our attention to
it could have benefited from a more precise delineation of its implications,
reference to our Corpus v. Cuaderno<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
ruling would indicate that what petitioner had in mind was the permanency of
the terms of an official whose line of work is likewise of a technical
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was made clear by Justice
J. B. L. Reyes, who penned the opinion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The tenure of officials holding primarily confidential positions
(such as private secretaries of public functionaries) ends upon loss of
confidence, because their term of office lasts only as long as confidence in
them endures; and thus their cessation involves no removal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the situation is different for those
holding highly technical posts, requiring special skills and
qualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution clearly
distinguished the pri­marily confidential from the highly technical, and to
apply the loss of confidence rule to the latter incumbents is to ignore and
erase the differentiation expressly made by our fundamental charter."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner did satisfy himself with citing the title of the above
decision and that of two subsequent cases<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
that adhere to the above principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
could be that he was more than per­suaded that such a succinct and abbreviated
form of argumentation would suffice to carry the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not, however, as a more careful
analysis of the above doctrine would indicate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied of course that the work of the Chief Legal
Counsel of respondent Bank, as of any lawyer for that matter, is impressed with
a highly technical aspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As had been
pointed out, however, it does not mean that thereby a client is precluded from
substituting in his stead another practitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is his right; his decision to terminate the relationship once made
is impressed with the attribute of finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lawyer cannot be heard to complain; it is enough that his right to
compen­sation earned be duly respected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that sense, it is equally clear that where the position
partakes of the attributes of being both technical and confidential, there can
be no insistence on a fixed or a definite term if the latter aspect
predominates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase the language
of the Chief Justice in the opinion previously cited, the incumbent of a
primarily confidential position, as was the case of petitioner, should realize
that at any time the appointing power may decide that his services are no
longer needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As thus correctly viewed,
Corpus v. Cuaderno cannot be read as lending support to petitioner's efforts to
retain his position as Chief Legal Counsel of respondent Bank, contrary to its
wishes as so explicitly declared in its Resolution No. 1053.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is manifest from the
foregoing that we have considered the crucial issue posed from the standpoint
of the right enjoyed by respondent Bank to choose who its legal counsel should
be and how long he would remain as such.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have not seen any need to pass upon the conflicting claims raised as
to the alleged failure of petitioner in the discharge of his functions to
extend the utmost protection to the interests of respondent Bank nor of the
vigorous defense of his actuations as such, which if given full credence, <span style="">would erase the slightest doubt as to his
competence and proficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as above
noted, the decisive issue is the confidential character of petitioner's
position, which negates reliance on the removal-for-­cause guarantee of the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thus leave open for
future </span>determination, when and if such a litigation arises, a case
involving the other vice-presidents of the respondent Bank, where it would
appear the overriding factor in their selection is not that degree of the
utmost confidence reposed in a lawyer but their technical skills in the
performance of the duties entrusted to them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
