decision of this Court adverse to respondent <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>
International Minerals Co., the Solicitor General brought to our attention
statements of record purportedly made by Vicente L. Santiago, <span class="SpellE">Erlito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, and Jose Beltran Sotto, members of the Bar,
with the suggestion that disciplinary action be taken against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November
 21, 1968</st1:date>, this Court issued a show-cause order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following statements, so the Solicitor General avers, are set
forth in the memoranda personally signed by Atty. Jose Beltran Sotto:</p>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>‘They
(petitioners, including the Execu­tive Secretary) have mace these false,
ridiculous and wild statements in a desperate attempt to prejudice the courts
against <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> International.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such efforts could be accurately called
“scattershot desperation" (Memorandum for Respondents dated March 27,
1968, pp. 13-14, three lines from the bottom of page 13 and first line page
14).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>‘Such a proposition is corrupt on </span>its face and it lays
bare the immoral and arrogant attitude of the petitioners.' (Respondents'
Supplemental Memorandum and Reply to Petitioner's Memorandum Brief, dated April
13, 1968, p. 16, last two lines on bottom of the page).</blockquote>

<blockquote>c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>‘The herein
petitioners x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> opportunistically
change their claims and stories not only from case to case but from pleading to
pleading in the same case.' (Respondents' Supplemental Memorandum, Ibid, p. 17,
sixth, seventh and eighth lines from bottom of the page)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">MacArthur's</span> third motion for
reconsideration signed <span style="">by Atty. Vicente
L. Santiago, on his behalf and purportedly for Attys. <span class="SpellE">Erlito</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> and Associates, and Jose B. Sotto, the Solicitor
General points out, contain the following statements:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"d.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>; and [the Supreme Court] has overlooked the applicable
law due to the misrepresentation and obfuscation of the petitioners' counsel.'
(Last sentence, par. 1, Third Motion for Reconsideration dated Sept. 10, 1968).</blockquote>

<blockquote>e.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Never has any civilized, democratic tribunal ruled that
such a gimmick (referring to the "right to reject any and all bids")
can be used by <span class="SpellE">vulturous</span> executives to cover up and
excuse losses to the public, a government agency or just plain fraud * * and it
is thus difficult, in the light of our upbringing and schooling, even under
many of the incumbent justices, that the Honorable Supreme Court intends to
create a decision that in effect does precisely that in a most absolute
manner.' (Second sentence, par. 7, Third Motion for Reconsideration dated Sept.
10, 1968)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion to inhibit
filed on September 21, 1968 - after judgment herein was rendered - and signed
by Vicente L. Santiago for himself and allegedly </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">Attys. <span class="SpellE">Erlito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Regala</span> and
Associates, asked Mr. Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
and Mr. Justice Fred Ruiz Castro to inhibit themselves from considering,
judging and resolving the case or any issue or aspect thereof retroactive to
January 11, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion charges
"[t]hat the brother of the Honorable Associate Justice Castro is a
vice-president of the favored party who is the chief beneficiary of the false,
erroneous and illegal decision dated January 31, 1968" and the ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> preliminary injunction rendered in the above-entitled
case, the latter in effect prejudging and predetermining this case even before
the joining of an issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the Chief
Justice, the motion states [t]hat the son of the Honorable Chief Justice
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was given a significant
appointment in the Philippine Government by the President a short time before
the decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1968</st1:date>
<span style="">was </span>rendered in this
case." The appointment referred to was as secretary of the newly-created
Board of Investments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion
presents a lengthy discourse on judicial ethics, and makes a number of side
comments projecting what is claimed to be the patent wrongfulness of the <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1968</st1:date> decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It enumerates "incidents" which,
according to the motion, brought about respondent Mac-Arthur's belief that
"<span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span> prejudice" had been caused it
and that there was "<span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span> favoritism"
in favor of "petitioners, their appointing authority and a favored party
directly benefited by the said decision." The "incidents" cited
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said decision <span style="">is </span>in violation of the law, which law

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1968</st1:date>,
Atty. Vicente L. Santiago, again <span style="">for
himself and Attys. <span class="SpellE">Erlito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> and
Associates, in writing pointed out to this Court that the statements specified
by the Solicitor General were either quoted out of context, could be defended,
or were comments legitimate and justifiable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Concern he expressed for the fullest defense of the interests of his
clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was stressed that if <span class="SpellE">MacArthur's</span> attorney could not plead such thoughts, his
client would be deprived of due process of law. However, counsel sought to
change the words "Chief Justice" to "Supreme Court"
appearing on line 7, paragraph 2 of the motion to inhibit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Santiago also voluntarily deleted
paragraph 6 of the said motion, which in full reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately for
our people, it seems that many of our judicial authorities believe that they
are the chosen messengers of God in all matters that come before them, and that
no matter what the circumstances are, their judgment is truly ordained by the
Almighty unto eternity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some seem to be
constitutionally incapable of considering that any emanation from their mind or
pen could be the product of <span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span> prejudice or <span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span> sympathy or favoritism for a party or an
issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness the recent absurdity of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Alikpala</span> daring to proceed to judge a motion to
hold himself in contempt of court - seemingly totally oblivious or
uncomprehending of the violation of moral principle involved – and <span style="">also of judge <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span>
who refuses to inhibit himself in judging a criminal case against an accused
who is also his correspondent in two other cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is the explanation for such
mentality?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it outright
dishonesty?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of intelligence?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Serious deficiency in moral comprehension?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or is it that many of our govern­ment
officials are just amoral?"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">And,
in addition, he attempted to explain further subparagraphs (f) and (h) of
paragraph 7 thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="12">December 2,
 1968</st1:date> that Atty. Vicente L. Santiago filed his compliance with this
Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21,
 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there stated that
the motion to inhibit and third motion for reconsideration were of his
exclusive making and that he alone should be held responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further
elaborated on his explanations made on <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November
 21, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1968</st1:date>,
he supplemented his explanations by saying that he already deleted paragraph 6
of the Motion to Inhibit heretofore quoted from his rough draft but that it was
still included through inadvertence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="3"><span style="">March 1,
 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, Atty. Vicente
L. Santiago, as counsel for <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>, registered an
amended motion to inhibit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it
repeats the prayer that Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
and Mr. Justice Castro inhibit themselves, it left but three paragraphs of the
original motion to inhibit, taking out the dissertation on judicial ethics and
most of the comments attacking the decision of this Court of July 31, 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the part of Atty. Jose Beltran Sotto, it must be stated that
as early as <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1968</st1:date>,
he insisted in withdrawing his appearance in this case as one of the lawyers of
<span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
ground was that he did not agree with the filing of the motion to inhibit the
two justices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him,
"[t]he present steps (sic) now being taken is against counsel's upbringing
and judicial cons­cience."</p>

<p class="BODY">In Atty. Jose Beltran <span class="SpellE">Sotto's</span> return of
<st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1968</st1:date>, he took
pains to say that the questioned statements he made were also taken out of context
and were necessary for the defense of his client <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made the admission, though, that those
statements lifted out of context would indeed be sufficient basis for a finding
that Section 20(f), Rule 138, had been violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1969</st1:date>,
additional arguments were filed by Atty. Jose Beltran Sotto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there averred that the Supreme Court <span style="">had no original jurisdiction over the charge
against him because it is one of civil contempt against a party and the charge
is ori­ginally cognizable by the Court of First Instance <span style="">under Sections </span>4 and 10, Rule 71 of
the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also stressed
that said charge was not signed by an "offended party <span style="">or witness", </span>as required by law;
and that the Solicitor General and his assistants could not stand in the stead
of an "offended party or witness."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his explanation
of December 2, 1968, as further clarified by a supplemental motion of December
27, 1968, he manifested that the <span style="">use </span>of
or reference to his law firm <span style="">in </span>this
case was neither authorized nor consented to b<span style="">y</span> him or any of his associates; that
on July 14, 1967, one Morton F. Meads, in <span class="SpellE">MacArthur's</span>
behalf, offered to retain his services, which was accepted; that Meads inquired
from him whether he could appear in this case; that he advised Meads that this
case was outside his professional competence and referred Meads to another
lawyer who later on likewise turned down the offer; that in view of the
rejection, Meads and he agreed to terminate their previous retainer agreement;
that he had not participated in any manner in the preparation or authorship of
any pleading or any other document in connection with this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1969</st1:date>,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Erlito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
explained his side of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
brief, he denied participation in any of the court papers subject of our
November 21, 1968 order; claimed that he was on six months' leave of absence
from July 1, 1968 to December 31, 1968 as one of the attorneys for <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> but that he gave his permission to have his name
included as counsel in all of <span class="SpellE">MacArthur's</span> pleadings
in this case (L-27072), even while he was on leave of absence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hearing on this contempt
incident </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">had on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="3"><span style="">March 3,
 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A second contempt proceeding arose when, on July 14, 1960,
respondent <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>, through new counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> who entered a
special appearance for <span style="">the purpose, </span>lodged
a fourth motion for reconsideration without express leave of court. Said motion
reiterated previous grounds raised, and contained the following paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The said decision
<span style="">is </span>illegal because it was
penned by the Honorable Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
when in fact he was outside the borders of the Republic of the Philippines <span style="">at the time of the Oral Argument of the above
entitled case -- which condition is prohibited by the New Rules of Court --
Section 1, Rule 51, and we quote: 'Justices; who may take part. -- X <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span>.
only those members present when any matter is submitted for oral argument will
take part in its consideration and adjudication X X'. This requirement is
especially significant in the present instance because the member who penned
the decision was the very member who was absent for approximately four months
or more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pro­vision also applies to
the Honorable Justices Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That if the
respondent <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> International Minerals Company
abandons its quest for justice in the Judiciary of the Philippine Government,
it will inevitably either raise the graft and corruption of Philippine Government
officials in the bidding of May 12, 1965, required by the Nickel Law to
determine the operator of the <span class="SpellE">surigao</span> nickel
deposits, to the World Court on grounds of deprivation of justice and confiscation
of property and/or to the United States Government, either its executive or
judicial branches or both, on the grounds of confiscation of respondent's
proprietary vested rights by the Philippine Government without either
compensation or due process of law -- and invoking the <span class="SpellE">Hickenlooper</span>
Amendment requiring the cutting off of all aid and benefits to the Philippine
Government, including the sugar price premium, amounting to more than fifty
million dollars annually, until restitution or compensation is made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This elicited another resolution from this Court on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1969</st1:date>, requiring Atty. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> "to show
cause <span style="">within </span>five (5) days from
receipt of notice hereof why <span style="">he </span>should
not be dealt with for contempt of court."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1969</st1:date>,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>
filed his return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there alleged that
the said fourth motion for reconsideration was already finalized when Atty.
Vicente L. Santiago came to his office and requested him to accommodate <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> by signing the motion; that he turned down said
request twice on the ground that he did not know anything about the case, much
less the truth of the allegations stated in the motion; that "the
allegations in <span style="">said motion were
subsequently explained to the undersigned counsel </span>together with the
background of the case involved by Atty. Vicente L. Santiago and by one Morton
F. Meads"; that upon assurance that there was nothing wrong with the
motion he was persuaded in good faith to sign the same; that he was misled in
so signing and the true facts of the allegations were not revealed to him especially
the oral argument allegedly made in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the foregoing explanation by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>,
this Court, on August 4, 1969, resolved "to require Atty. Vicente L.
Santiago and Morton Meads to file in writing their answer to the said return
[of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>] and at the same time to show cause
why they, Atty. Vicente L. Santiago and Morton Meads, should not be dealt with
for contempt of court, on or before August 16, 1969; and x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> to direct that the three, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>, Atty. Vicente L. Santiago, and Morton
Meads, personally appear before this Court on Thursday, August 27, 1969, at
9:30 a.m., on which date the contempt proceedings against all of them will be
heard by this Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1969</st1:date>,
Atty. Vicente L. Santiago gave his explanation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He disavowed the truth of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caling's</span>
statement that he (<st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>)
convinced <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> to sign the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth, according to <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
is that one day Morton Meads went to his office and asked him if he knew of a
lawyer nearby who could help him file another motion for reconsideration, and
he (<st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>) mentioned Atty. <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>; he thereupon accompanied Meads to <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>, told <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> of Meads'
desire and left Meads with <span class="SpellE">Caling</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>

to make some changes in pencil in the first </span><span style="">or second </span><span style="">paragraph </span>when Meads told him that <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>
wanted a new lawyer, <span style="">not </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santiago</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, to file the same. Meads </span>asked <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santiago</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> if he </span>could
recommend one. They then went to <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> whose office

introduced Meads to <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> at the same time handing

left. After reading the motion, <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> gave his
go-signal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed the same after his

<p class="BODY">In defending himself from the contempt charge, Meads asserts that

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="8"><span style="">August
 27, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
heard Attys. Vicente L. Santiago and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> and Morton Meads in oral argument with respect to
the second contempt incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We shall now discuss the first and second contempt incidents <u>seriatim</u>.</p>

<blockquote>1. We start with the case of Atty. Vicente L. Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his third motion for reconsideration, we,
indeed, find language that is not to be expected of an officer of the
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pictures petitioners as
"<span class="SpellE">vulturous</span> executives". Be <span style="">speaks </span>of this Court as a
"civilized, democratic tribunal", but by innuendo would suggest that
it is not.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his motion to inhibit, his first paragraph categorizes our
decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1968</st1:date>
as "false, erroneous and illegal" in a presumptuous manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He there charges that the ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> preliminary injunction we issued in this case
prejudiced and predetermined the case even before the joining of an issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He accuses <u>in a</u> <u>reckless</u> <u>manner</u>
two justices of this Court for being interested in the decision of this case:
Associate Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, because his brother is the vice president
of the favored party who is the chief beneficiary of the decision, and Chief
Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, whose son <span style="">was </span>appointed secretary of the
newly-created Board of Investments, "a significant appointment in the
Philippine Government by the President, a short time before the decision of
July 31, 1968 was rendered." In this backdrop, he proceeds to state that
"it would seem that the principles thus established [the moral and ethical
guidelines for inhibition of any judicial authority] by the Honorable Supreme
Court should first apply to itself." He puts forth the claim that lesser
and further removed conditions have been known to create favoritism, only to
conclude that there is <u>no</u> <u>reason</u> for a belief that the conditions
obtaining in the case of the Chief Justice and Justice Castro "would be
less likely to engender favoritism or prejudice for or against a particular
cause or party." Implicit in this at least is that the Chief Justice and
Justice Castro are insensible to <span class="SpellE"><u>delicadeza</u></span>,
which could make their actuation suspect. He makes it plain in the motion that
the Chief Justice and Justice Castro not only were not free from the appearance
of impropriety but did arouse suspicion that their relationship did affect
their judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points out that
courts) <span style="">must be above suspicion at all
times like Caesar's wife, warns that loss of confidence for the Tribunal or a
member thereof should not be allowed to happen in our country, </span><span style="">"<u>although </u></span><u><span style="">the </span></u><u><span style="">process </span></u><u><span style="">has </span></u><u><span style="">already begun</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is true that </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santiago</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> voluntarily deleted paragraph 6 which
contained language that is as disrespectful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But we cannot erase the fact that it has been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained that he deleted this paragraph
in his rough draft, which paragraph was included in the motion filed in this
Court only because of mere inadvertence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This explanation does not make much of a distinguishing difference; it
erects no shield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only because it
was belatedly made but also because his signature appeared on the motion to
inhibit which included paragraph 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this paragraph 6 describes with derision "many of our judicial
authorities" who "believe that they are the chosen messengers of God
in all matters that come before them, and that no matter what the circumstances
are, their judgment is truly ordained by the Almighty unto eternity." It
depicts them as seemingly "incapable of considering that any emanation
from their mind or pen could be the product of <span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span>
prejudice or <span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span> sympathy or favoritism for a
party or an issue." After citing acts of two judges of first instance, he
paused to ask:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What is the
explanation for such mentality?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it
outright dishonesty?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of
intelligence?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Serious deficiency in
moral comprehension?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or is it that many
of our government officials are just amoral?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 7 also of the motion to inhibit repeated mention of
"<span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span> prejudice" against respondent <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> and spoke of "<span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span>
favoritism" for petitioners, their appointing authority and a favored
party directly benefited by the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph 8 is a lecture on judicial ethics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 9 is a warning to this Court about
loss of confidence, and paragraph 10 makes a sweeping statement that "any
other justices who have received favors or benefits directly or indirectly from
any of the petitioners or members of any board-petitioner, or their agents or
principals, including the President", should also inhibit themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is disconcerting is that Atty. Santiago's accusations have
no basis in fact and in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slur
made is not limited to the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sweepingly casts aspersion on the whole
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, inhibition is also asked of,
we repeat, "any other justices who have received favors or benefits
directly or indirectly from any of the petitioners or any mem­bers of any
board-petitioner or their agents or principals, including the President."
The absurdity of this posture is at once apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the justices of this Court are
appointed by the President and in that sense may be considered to have each
received a favor from the President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Should these justices inhibit them<span style="">selves </span>every time a case involving the Administration crops up?
Such a thought may not certainly be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consequen<span style="">ce </span><span style="">thereof would be to
paralyze the machinery of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
would in fact, be wreaking havoc on the tripartite system of government operating
in this country. Counsel is presumed to know this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But why the unfounded charge?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">There is the </span><span style="">not-too-well
concealed effort on the part of a </span><span style="">losing litigant's </span><span style="">attorney
to downgrade this Court,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The mischief that stems
from all of the foregoing gross disrespect is easy to discern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such disrespect detracts much from the
dignity of a court of justice. Decidedly not an expression of faith, counsel's
words are intended to create </span><span style="">an
atmosphere </span><span style="">of distrust, of
disbelief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are thus called upon to
repeat what we have said in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Rheem</u></span><u> </u><u><span style="">of the </span>Philippines </u><u><span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span></u><span style=""> (1967), 20 SCRA 441, 444, as follows:
"By now, a lawyer's duties </span><span style="">to
the </span><span style="">Court have become
commonplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, there could hardly
be any valid excuse for lapses in the observance thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of
Court, in categorical terms, spells out one such duty: 'To observe and maintain
the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.' As explicit is
the first canon of legal ethics which pronounces that '[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]t
</span><span style="">is the </span><span style="">duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the
Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of
the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance.' That
same canon, as a corollary, makes it peculiarly incumbent upon lawyers to support
the courts against 'unjust criticism and clamor.' And more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attorney's oath solemnly binds him to a
conduct that should be 'with all good fidelity x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to the courts.' Worth remembering is that the duty of an
attorney to the courts 'can only be maintained by rendering no service

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The precepts, the
teachings, the injunctions just recited are not unfamiliar to lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, this Court finds in the language of
Atty. Santiago a style that undermines and degrades the administration of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stricture in Section 3(d)

<blockquote>1. We next take the case of Atty. Jose Beltran Sotto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We analyze the statements pointed out to us
by the Solicitor General hereinbefore quoted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sotto accuses petitioners of having made "false, ridiculous and
wild statements in a desperate attempt to prejudice the courts against <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>." He brands such efforts as
"scattershot desperation". He describes a proposition of petitioners
as "corrupt on its face", laying bare "the immoral and arrogant
attitude of the petitioners." He charges petitioners with
opportunistically changing their claims and stories not only from case to case
but from pleading to pleading in the same case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such language is not arguably protected; it is the surfacing of a feeling
of contempt towards a litigant; it offends the court before which it is
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no excuse to say that these
statements were taken out of context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have analyzed the lines surrounding said statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not in any manner justify the

<p class="BODY">Not far from the case of Atty. Sotto is <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Young</u>,
83 Phil. 702, 708, where counsel for the accused convicted of murder made use
of the following raw language in his brief: "The accused since birth was a
poor man and a son of a poor farmer, that since his boyhood he has never owned
a thousand pesos in his own name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
here comes a chance for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cold
fifty thousand bucks in exchange of a man's life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple job.<span style="">&nbsp;

man blinded by the promise of wealth, protection and stability was given to do
the forbidden deed." We there held that "[s]<span class="SpellE">uch</span>
a plea is a disgrace to the bar and an affront to the court."</p>

this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not resigned from his
posi­tion as such lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has control
of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever steps his
client takes should be within his knowledge and responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Canon 16 of the Canons of Legal
Ethics should have reminded him that "[a] lawyer should use his best
efforts to restrain and to prevent his clients from doing those things which
the lawyer himself ought not to do, particularly with reference to their
conduct towards Courts, judicial officers, jurors, witnesses and suitors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a client persists in such wrongdoing the
lawyer should terminate their relation."</p>

<p class="BODY">The dignity of the Court, experience teaches, can never be
protected where infraction of ethics meets with complacency rather than
punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people should not be
given cause to break faith with the belief that a judge is the epitome of honor
amongst men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To preserve its dignity, a
court of justice should not yield to the assaults of disrespect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Punctilio of honor, we prefer to think, is a
standard of behavior so desirable in a lawyer pleading a cause before a court
of justice.</p>

<blockquote>9. One last word. It would seem apropos to say again that, if only
for one reason, this Court had really no alternative but to decide the main
case against respondent <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we held in our decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1968</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>
did not even adhere to the terms and conditions of the invitation to bid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, this invitation to bid explicitly warned
that "bids not accompanied by bid bonds will be rejected." And, we
repeat, "[a]<span class="SpellE">dmittedly</span>, the bid of the Company [<span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>] had been submitted <u>without</u> the requisite
bond."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It would not require the adroit mind of a lawyer <span style="">to say that <span style="">a </span>bid
unaccompanied by a bond, contrary <span style="">to
the instruc­</span>tions to bidders, is not entitled to any consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
