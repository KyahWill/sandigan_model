				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in Civil Case No. Q-6497 ordering the therein
defendants and all persons claiming rights under them to vacate, and restore to
the plaintiff the possession of the land described in the complaint, and
further ordering each of them to pay the plaintiff the sum of P25.00 monthly
from the date of their respective occupation until posses­sion is restored to
the latter, plus the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> &amp; Housing
Corporation, hereinafter referred to as PHHC, commenced this action to recover
from the defendants the possession of Lot 11, Block E-144, East Avenue
Subdivision, which formed part of a bigger tract of land covered by TCT No.
1356 of the Land Records of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, issued in
its name, further praying for an order for the removal and/or demolition of all
constructions and improvements introduced by the defendants on the land
aforesaid, and sentencing them further to pay the monthly rental of P25.00 from
Janu­ary 1969 until they have vacated the premises, plus attorney's fees and
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Corazon <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span> was the only one
who answered the complaint admitting that the plaintiff was the owner of the
land described therein but interposing the following special defenses and
counterclaim:</p>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That defendant Corazon <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span>
avers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that because of the failure or
refusal of the plaintiff to notify her that the property in question has
already been awarded to another person, who has never occupied the premises
prior to or after such award, and in whose favor a Conditional Contract to Sell
has been executed by the plaintiff corporation in utter disregard and in sheer
violation of the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> Housing
Corporation standing policy to award similar lots to the actual occupants
thereon by reason of priority or preference; that the defendant, having no
knowledge or information of the above development further introduced
improvements, hoping in good faith that the said lot will ultimately be awarded
to her; and that she was never notified in writing or otherwise that her
mentioned application was not or cannot be acted upon;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
the award and subsequent execution of the "Conditional Contract to
Sell" in favor of Felipe A. <span class="SpellE">Gahol</span> are both
irregular and improper, inasmuch as the said <span class="SpellE">Gahol</span>
should not have been given the priority over and above the application of
Corazon <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span>, under ordinary and usual circumstances;
and as</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">COUNTERCLAIM<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendant
Corazon <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span> alleges:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That long before the award and subsequent execution of the mentioned
"Conditional Contract to Sell" in favor of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Gahol</span>,
she has been in the possession of the premises and the refusal or failure in
bad faith of the plaintiff in not acting upon her application and its
subsequent refusal and failure in bad faith to notify her of the same, has
incurred her in damages in the amount of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos Only
(P1,500.00) by way of actual or compensatory damages; that by reason of this
action, the defendant was compelled to employ services of counsel for the sum
of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other defendants were declared in default.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was first set for trial on <st1:date month="11" day="27" year="1963">November 27, 1963</st1:date>, at <st1:time hour="8" minute="30">8:30
 a.m.</st1:time>, the corresponding notice having been served upon and received
by Atty. Ben <span class="SpellE">Hur</span> Z. <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span>,
appellant's counsel, on November 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following day, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span> filed a motion for
postponement of trial alleging that on November 27 he had to attend the trial
of Criminal Case No. 058984 entitled "People vs. Carlos <span class="SpellE">Panadero</span>" before the City Court of Manila, Branch
VII.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was not set for hearing
on any specific date but contained a request that it be "submitted for
consideration of the court as soon as possible."</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called for trial in the morning of <st1:date month="11" day="27" year="1963">November 27, 1963</st1:date>, only the
plaintiff and its attorney appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view thereof, upon motion of the latter, the court issued an order authorizing
plaintiff to present its evidence before the clerk of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="16" year="1963">December 16, 1963</st1:date>,
defendant's counsel moved for the reconsideration of the court's order of Novem­ber
27 and for a re-trial of the case, claiming that his failure to attend the
trial was due to his appearance at the trial of the criminal case mentioned in
his motion for postponement, and claiming further that defendant's case was
highly meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before the
motion for reconsideration could be heard, the court rendered the appealed
judgment on <st1:date month="12" day="11" year="1963">December 11, 1963</st1:date>
on the basis of evidence presented by plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="23" year="1963">December 23, 1963</st1:date>,
the defendant filed a motion to set aside the decision mentioned above
alleging, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, the following:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

allowing the plaintiff to present its evidence ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>
on failure of the defendant Corazon <span class="SpellE">Mobo</span> or her
counsel to appear at the mentioned initial hearing of the above-entitled case,
copy of which was furnished the defendant on December 12, 1963;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That on December 16, 1963, counsel for the defendant filed motion
for reconsidera­tion of the said order of November 27, 1963, but before the
said motion could be heard on December 21, 1963, counsel for the defendant
received a copy of this Court's decision in the above-entitled case dated
December 11, 1963, on December 18, 1963; consequently, the said motion for
reconsideration was denied by this Honorable Court;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That the said decision of this Court was rendered based on this
Court's order of <st1:date month="11" day="27" year="1963">November 27, 1963</st1:date>,
allowing the plain­tiff to present its evidence ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>
and without giving the defendant the right to cross-examine the witnesses for
the plain­tiff and to present her own evidence;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That the reasons why defendant failed to appear in the initial
hearing of this case on <st1:date month="11" day="27" year="1963">November 27,
 1963</st1:date> are as follows, to wit:</blockquote>

before Branch VII of the City Court of Manila agreed with the private

<blockquote>That the granting of this motion will not in any way affect the
right of the plaintiff, whereas, a denial of the same will necessarily affect
the substantial right of the defendant for the same will be tantamount to a
deprivation of her property without due process;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion mentioned in the preceding paragraph was not under
oath nor was it supported by affidavits of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So on <st1:date month="1" day="4" year="1964">January
 4, 1964</st1:date>, the same was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter the defendant perfected her appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the record on appeal does not include any order issued by
the trial court denying appellant's motion for reconsideration, she admits that
"the said motion for reconsideration was denied" by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on
Appeal p. 32).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's lone assignment of error is to the effect that the
trial court erred in denying her urgent motion for continuance; her motion for
reconsideration, and her motion to set aside the decision rendered; all these
amounting "to deprivation without due process."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record <span class="GramE">We</span> are
constrained to hold that appellant's contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled in this jurisdiction that, whether to grant or to
deny a motion for the postponement of a trial is a matter addressed to the
sound discretion of the trial judge, and unless it is clearly shown that such
discretion was gravely abused, His Honor's resolution will not be interfered
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even in cases where
there was abuse of discretion in the denial of a motion of such nature, the
case is not to be reopened, much less a decision already rendered set aside,
unless the aggrieved party shows that she has a meritorious case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case appellant has failed to
make such showing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, she admits
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> owns the land in question; that she
occupies a portion thereof without the benefit of any contract authorizing such
occupancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her only claim is that, having
been in possession of said land for a good period of time, she was entitled to
a priority right to acquire the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe, is not a sufficient legal
defense against <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span>
hold that the trial court did not commit the error imputed to it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appeal<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
