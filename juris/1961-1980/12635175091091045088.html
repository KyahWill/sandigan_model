injunction and prohibition, one of the several cases that this Tribunal has
been asked to <span style="">arbitrate, arising from
the filin</span>g<span style=""> in court of </span>g<span style="">raft-and-corrupt-practices cases against
several munici</span>p<span style="">al officials of <span class="SpellE">M<span style="">a</span>kati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, has been instituted b</span>y <span style="">Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
the incumbent </span>Acting <span style="">ma</span>y<span style="">or of <span class="SpellE">M<span style="">akati</span></span></span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to restrain (1) the enforcement of the order of the
Court of F<span style="">irst
</span>Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Criminal Case No. 19346,
suspending him from office, and (2) the appointment of and take-over by,
respondent Johnny Wilson as Acting Municipal Mayor of the said
municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of resolving
the particular issues involved in this proceeding, the facts of the case may be
stated as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As a consequence of our decision in G. R. No.</span>
L-30306 (Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> vs. Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, et al.) promulgated on 20 June 1969, upholding the
suspension from office, by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
of elected Mayor <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>,
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gealogo</span>,
and Councilors <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Ventura, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span> and Bernardo
<span class="SpellE">Nonato</span>, among other accused, as a result of their
having been found guilty of violation of Republic Act 3019 (Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act), then ranking Councilor Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
entered into the office of and duly Qualified as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records show,
however, that on 30 May 1969, or prior to his assumption of the <span class="SpellE">mayorship</span>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> S. Rolls,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> was himself charged with violation of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices law before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in an information signed by then Provincial Fiscal
Benjamin H. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> (Criminal Case No. 19346).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To forestall his suspension from public office,
<span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> filed with this Court on 3 June 1969 a
petition for prohibition</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to restrain the Provincial Fiscal from
filing the information </span>against <span style="">him;
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> from accepting
and/or giving due course to that information; and to have said information
declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was
based on the allegations that the disputed information, although dated 29 May
1969, was actually transmitted to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> only on 30 May 1969, the very day when the respondent
fiscal took his oath of office as judge of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Court of First Instance; and that such criminal information was filed without
the respondent fiscal having conducted a preliminary investigation and</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">without
giving the accused (petitioner) notice and opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 5 June 1969, this Court dismissed the
petition, but without prejudice to petitioner's filing with the court a quo of
an appropriate motion for the conducting of a preliminary investigation and for
the suspension in the meantime of the criminal proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Conformably with the aforesaid resolution, petitioner filed <span style="">with </span>the lower court a motion to allow
the holding of a preliminary investigation of the case, on the same grounds of
lack of preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="6">14 June 1969</st1:date>, this motion was <span class="GramE">denied,</span> the court below pointing out that the information
carried <span style="">a </span>verified
certification by the provincial fiscal that he had conducted the required
preliminary investigation on the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, considering that said fiscal had been appointed to the
judiciary, the court ventured the opinion that there was nothing wrong in the
incumbent provincial <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> conducting a
reinvestigation or review of the evidence in the hands of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the latter was given 30 days from
receipt of the order within which to signify in writing whether or not he
deemed it necessary to conduct a reinvestigation of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the provincial Fiscal B. Jose Castillo, however, manifested
that no reinvestigation of the case could be made without any petition <span style="">to </span>this effect from the accused, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> filed on <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="7">12
 July 1969</st1:date> <span style="">a </span>request
for the fiscal to conduct a preliminary investigation and/or
reinvestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of these
incidents, petitioner's arraignment had to <span style="">be </span>postponed several times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="9">13 September 1969</st1:date>,
the Provincial <span style="">Fiscal </span>granted
petitioner's request for reinvestigation, the court being notified
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="9">15 September 1969</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
was <span style="">arraigned </span>and entered a plea
of not guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
the court set the trial of the case for <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="10">15 October 1969</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
without prejudice <span style="">to the </span>outcome
of the reinvestigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in a written manifestation dated 15 December 1969, <span style="">the P</span>rovincial Fiscal informed the
court that he had conducted a preliminary investigation and/or reinvestigation
of the case, with notice to the parties, on 18 October 1969; that on said date,
counsel for the petitioner manifested that the evidence previously submitted to
State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>,
Jr. be considered and upon receipt of the respective memoranda of the Police
Commission and the petitioner, the case be deemed submitted for resolution; and
that taking into consideration the aforesaid evidence previously adduced
together with the memoranda of the parties, he (the fiscal) believed that there
existed sufficient evidence to establish prima facie the guilt of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, 15 December
1969, the court issued an order in Criminal Case No. 19346, suspending the
accused Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span> from public office pursuant
to Section 13 of Republic Act 3019, "[I]t appearing that the information
charging the accused is sufficient in form and substance and the validity of
said information is apparent".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately, the accused filed with the respondent court an urgent
motion for reconsideration of said order and for the holding <span style="">in </span>abeyance
of the suspension-directive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also
appears from the record that at <st1:time minute="45" hour="14">2:45</st1:time>
in the afternoon of that day, <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="12">15
 December 1969</st1:date>, respondent Johnny Wilson, the Acting Vice-Mayor,
took an oath of office as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
before a judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 16 December 1970, <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>
instituted the present proceeding in this Court, originally against Johnny
Wilson (who apparently did not press his intention to occupy the position of
Acting Mayor) and the Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
only, which was given due course on the same day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, acting on petitioner's prayer, <span style="">we </span>issued a
temporary restraining order against respondent Provincial Governor, to prevent
him from appointing respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Wilson</st1:place></st1:city>
as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
and the latter from usurping and intruding into the office of petitioner as
Acting Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court likewise
directed petitioner to include as <span class="GramE">parties</span> respondent
the Judge of the Court of first Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
before whom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case No. 19346 was
pending, and the people of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, the petitioner did; thus, on 19
December 1969, this Court issued another temporary restraining order to include
in the prohibition the enforcement by the respondent Judge of his automatic
suspension order of 15 December 1969 against the petitioner, and the ordering
or causing of the latter's arrest for performing the duties of Acting mayor of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In ascribing illegality to the 15 December order of suspension in
<span style="">thi</span>s<span style=""> </span>case, allegedly issued by the respondent Judge in grave abuse
of discretion, petitioner invokes two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">(a) </span>that
he was denied his <span style="">day in court when the </span>respondent Judge reached the conclusion that
the <span style="">information
is valid, </span>without affording him opportunity to be heard; and (b) that
the information does not charge an indictable offense under <span style="">Re</span>public Act 3019, and that no
preliminary investigation was conducted in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the case was submitted and while pending decision by this
Court, respondent Johnny Wilson filed, on 30 June 1970, a motion to the effect
that, abandoning his previous stand, said respondent was willing to confess
judgment in all material points relevant to the issue of holding a hearing to
determine the validity of an information filed under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
practices Act, and consequently prayed that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) he be allowed to withdraw his answers, memoranda and oral arguments
and to confess judgment on all material points contained in the petition; (2)
that the counterclaim be dismissed; (3) that the temporary restraining order
issued by this Court against respondent Judge Mariano be lifted; and <span style="">(4) that said judge be ordered to hold a
hearing on the validity of the </span><span style="">information
filed in Criminal Case No. 19346 of the Court of first Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch X (People vs. Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>,
et al.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for other respondents,
required to comment, manifested conformity to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Wilson</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">'s motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the basic stand of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Luciano</span>, assented to by respondent Wilson in his motion,
that there should have been a hearing on the validity of the information,
appears conformable to the spirit of the law, taking into account the serious
and far reaching consequences of a suspension of an elected public official
even before his conviction; and considering that public interest demands a
speedy determination of the issues involved in this case as well as in the case
pending against petitioner in the branch of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> presided by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Mariano, this Court is of the opinion that the motion should be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the hearing thus to be held, petitioner's
submission that the information charges no indictable offense and that no due
preliminary investigation was made by the Provincial Fiscal, can be fully
ventilated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">Accordingly</span></b><span style="">, the Court resolves:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
