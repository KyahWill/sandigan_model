				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, dismissing Civil Case No. 313 thereof, is before
Us upon certification by the Court of Appeals, only questions of law being
raised therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the institution of said <span style="">case, </span>plaintiff Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Catain</span> had
filed Civil Case No. 268 of the same court, which was dismissed, upon the
ground that, although its object was to recover the possession of a land, the
right thereto hinged on the ownership thereof, in view of which the court
reserved to the parties the right to settle this question in another action <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
aforementioned Case No. 313.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that, on <st1:date year="1954" day="8" month="3">March
 8, 1954</st1:date>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Rios sold the
land in question - which is situated in the <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Ituan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Busuanga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:placename></st1:place> - to plaintiff
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Catain</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Over a year later, or on <st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1955</st1:date>, Rios sold the same land to his co-defendant herein,
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When, sometime after the second sale, plaintiff sought to take physical
possession of said land, <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> refused to turn it
over to him. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Accordingly, plaintiff
commenced the former action for the recovery of possession, and, upon its
dismissal, as above stated, the present case, against <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, to establish title to said
property, as well as to secure its possession and recover damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios did not care to file his answer to the complaint or otherwise contest the
same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relying upon Article 1544 of the Civil Code of the Philippines,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> the lower court rendered judgment for <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> and against the plain­tiff, upon the theory that,
since neither the deed of sale to <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> nor that
executed in favor of the plaintiff had been registered, the former has a better
right, he having been first in the physical possession of the disputed land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, we find that the decision appealed <span style="">from </span>cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is well settled that the
possession referred to in the last paragraph of said Art. 1544, includes
actual, as well as constructive possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> In the
case at bar, both sales had been made through public instruments, so that, upon
execution of the deed of conveyance in favor of plaintiff herein, the property
sold was deemed symbolically delivered to him, inasmuch as the contrary does
not appear and cannot be clearly inferred from said instrument.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> <span style="">What </span>is
more, as hereafter pointed out, the intent of the parties, at the time of the
execution thereof, was to thereby consummate a full transfer of the
corresponding right <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u>, in and to the
property in litigation, to plaintiff herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> was then in
actual possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
possession was, however, a precarious one, for, admittedly, he then held the
land, <u>not</u> adversely to, but with the consent and, therefore, on behalf
of defendant <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Rios.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was due to the fact that prior thereto, <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> had bought from <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span>
Rios, father of <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Rios, <u>another</u> land -
located in the <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE"><u>Malabnao</u></span>
- which, however, could not be delivered to <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>
because it was the object of a litigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pending final determination thereof, it was agreed, therefore, between <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Rios - his father having died <span style="">in </span>the meantime - and <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, that the latter would <u>meanwhile</u> hold the
property now in question - located in the <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Ituan</span> - although <u>not</u> in a proprietary
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it has been
stipulated, between the parties herein, that <span class="SpellE">Tamayo's</span>
possession was <u>not</u> that of an owner, until <st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1955</st1:date>, when - owing to subsequent develop­ments,
making it impossible to turn over to <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> the land
situated in <span class="SpellE">Malabnao</span> - <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios executed the aforementioned deed of sale in his (<span class="SpellE">Tamayo's</span>)
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the sale to plaintiff herein, on March 8, 1954,
and for over a year thereafter, Rios was, therefore, in civil pos­session of
the land in question, in much the same way as he would have been in such
possession had the land been physically held by his tenant, administrator or
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And his intent to make a symbolic
and effective delivery of that civil possession to the plaintiff could be and
was carried out through the execution of the public instrument evidencing the
sale to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, besides, a decisive factor in favor of plaintiff
herein, and that is that <span style="">the </span>property
in question is <u>registered</u>, not in the name of <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios, but <u>in that of plaintiff's father, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Catain</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, it is alleged in
plaintiff's complaint, and not denied in defendants' answer, that said property
is covered by Patent No. 2127 and Original Certificate of Title No. 344 of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>, both in the name of said Vicente <span class="SpellE">Catain</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that, sometime before 1951, the latter had sold the property to <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> Rios, father of defendant <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios, subject to redemption, which was exercised by plain­tiff Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Catain</span>, on <st1:date year="1954" day="8" month="3">March 8,
 1954</st1:date>, his own father having died prior thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one reason or another, said conditional
sale by Vicente <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Catain</span></span><span style=""> </span>to <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span>
Rios was not registered, although the owner's duplicate of said Original
Certificate of Title No. 344 had been delivered to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when, on March 8, 1954, plaintiff
redeemed the property from <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Rios, hose father
had, also, died in the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> turned over
<span style="">to </span>plaintiff said owner's
duplicate of Original Certificate of Title No. 344 and the corres­ponding tax
declaration, as well as executed, before the Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Busuanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, an affidavit
of transfer of said property to him (plaintiff).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As heretofore adverted to, the public
instrument evidencing the sale in his favor, coupled with the surrender of the owner's
duplicate of said original certificate of title and the tax declaration, and
the execution of said affidavit of transfer of real estate, for purposes of
taxation, manifestly reveal the intent of <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios to do everything necessary to fully convey and transfer effectively to
plaintiff herein the real right of ownership over the land in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, inasmuch as said land was registered in the name of
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Catain</span> when <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
Rios sold it to <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> - as well as at present - and
this appeared and still appears in public records, in the Office of the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>
must be deemed to have notice of such fact <a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> and
cannot legally claim that he bought the land in the belief, in good faith, that
it belonged to <span style="">Rios, </span>who could
not even produce - at the time of the <span style="">sale
</span>to <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> - the owner's duplicate of the
original certificate of title in the name of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Catain</span>,
the same having been previously delivered to <span style="">plain­tiff </span>herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">fact, </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Tamayo</u></span><u> did not allege</u> in his answer that he
bought the property in question in good faith or that he acted in good faith
when, on <u><span style="">August 20, 1955</span></u><span style="">, </span>he converted his, up to then,
precarious possession, into one as owner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the lower court found that there was good faith on his part,
when his possession began <u><span style="">in 1951</span></u><span style="">, </span>this did not suffice to place him
within the purview of the third paragraph of the aforementioned Article 1544,
because - as already pointed out - such possession was one held <u>with the
consent</u> of <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> Rios, and, hence, <u>in his
representation and behalf</u>, not adversely to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>
is not entitled to the benefits of said legal provision.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, a deed conveying a land covered by a certificate of
title, under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system, does not transmit a
right <u>in <span class="SpellE">rem</span></u> until the registration of said
instrument,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> and that executed in favor of<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> has
not been registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it <u><span style="">could </span>not</u> have been registered, it
having been executed by <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Rios, whereas the
land is registered in the name of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Catain</span>, and
<span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> could not have presented the owner's duplicate
of the certificate of title.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is urged in plaintiff' s brief that, in view of <span class="SpellE">Tamayo's</span> unjusti­fied and illegal refusal to surrender the
physical possession of the property in question, the former has suffered
damages equivalent to 50 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> yearly, at the rate of P8.00 a <span class="SpellE">cavan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without contesting the sufficiency of the
evidence on this point, <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> argues that plaintiff
is not entitled to recover said damages, because said refusal was justified by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch, however, as <span class="SpellE">Tamayo's</span> stand is not legally tenable, it follows
necessarily that he should indemnify said damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed
and another one shall be entered ordering the defendants herein to vacate the
property in question and to deliver the possession thereof to plaintiff herein,
as well as sentencing said defendants to pay him by way of damages the price of
50 <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> a year,
from August 20, 1955, up to the date on which said delivery shall have taken
place, computed at the rate of P8.00 a <span class="SpellE">cavan</span>, with
interest thereon at the legal rate, from September 22, 1958, when this action
was be­gun, in addition to attorney's fees in the sum of P1,000.00, and the costs.</p>
