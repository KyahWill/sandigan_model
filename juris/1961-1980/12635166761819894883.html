the trial court on the accused for the crime of Robbery with Triple Homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the information filed before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, the accused, <span class="SpellE">Dicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maalum</span> <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span>, was charged with the crime of Robbery with Triple
Homicide (Criminal Case No. 9694); alleged to have been committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about February 20, 1966, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, having boarded a motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> named "MAMI I", owned by <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Mola</span>, together with other
passengers bound for <span class="SpellE">Talicud</span> Island, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and once the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span>
was in the middle of the sea and when it developed engine trouble, the accused,
conspiring together and helping one ano­ther, with intent to steal the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and by means of in­timidation, the accused <span class="SpellE">Dicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span> firing his .22 cal.
revol­ver to <span style="">scare
</span>the passengers of the <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, and fired at one
of the passengers, hitting the said passenger at the right shoulder, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously took and carried away
the said motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> "MAMI I", belonging to
the said <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Mola</span>,
valued at P2,100.00, to the damage and prejudice of the above-named owner in
the aforementioned amount of P2,100.00, and as a result of the jumping into the
sea of all the passengers of the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, Alfonso
Ville-gas, Bernardo Villegas and Lourdes Villegas, all passen­gers of the motor
<span class="SpellE">banca</span> were drowned and died."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the scheduled date of arraignment on March 7, 1966, the
accused, through their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
Atty. Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Bolcan</span>, Jr., manifested their desire
to plead guilty only as to the fact of "the killing of one of the persons
mentioned in the information,"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
denying the killing of the two other persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fiscal, however, manifested that the State could not agree to the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> offer to plead guilty to only one homicide, since
"the two other persons were lost on the same occasion, . . <span style="">because </span>of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They jumped overboard after the firing at one
of the victims, . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial judge, Hon. Manses G. Reyes, accordingly did not ac­cept the plea and
reset the arraignment for the next day, inform­ing the accused that as the
prosecution was not agreeable to their qualified plea, they would have to enter
into trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called on the following day, the information
was read to the accused in the dialect they understood, and both accused
pleaded guilty, their counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
invoking, in their favor two mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty and
lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fiscal objected to the appreciation of the latter circumstance,
remonstrating that "there could be no lack of intent when they immediately
fired at one of the victims point blank with a pistol, that is fatal."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case was submitted and the trial court rendered there­after
on <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1966</st1:date>, its
decision, crediting the accused with the mitigating circumstance of their
voluntary plea of guilty, but rejecting the claimed mitigating circumstance of
lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong, in view of "the nature and
gravity of the <span style="">offense </span>committed."
The trial court further found two aggra­vating circumstances against the
accused, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"A
perusal </span>of the information reveals the following allegations in the
information:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"X <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span> <u>and once the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> was in the middle of the sea and when it developed
engine trouble</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These </span>allegations
to the mind of the Court consti­tute two aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first underlined portion constitutes the
aggravating circumstance that the crime was committed in an uninhabited
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Rubia</span>,
52 Phil. 172).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the second
constitutes the aggravating circumstance that the crime is committed on the
occasion of conflagration, shipwreck, earthquake, epidemic or other calamity or
misfortune.</p>

<blockquote>The Court believes that the development of engine trouble in the
middle of the sea is a misfortune which tends to create confusions and
apprehensions of the passengers and, thereby, to commit a crime at such a time
the accused manifested greater perversity and instead of <span style="">rendering </span>help increased their
affliction by taking advan­tage of the said misfortune.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As it is, therefore, the accused in the commission of this crime
has one mitigating circumstance in their favor and two aggravating circumstances
against them, and off­setting one another there is still remaining one aggravat­ing
circumstance against the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Consequently, the trial court sentenced
each of the accused to the penalty of death and ordered both of them, jointly
and severally, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Alfonso Villegas,
Bernardo Villegas and Lourdes Villegas in the amount of P6,000.00 for each of
them, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency by reason of the
penalty imposed, and to indemnify <span class="SpellE">Epimaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Mola</span> in the sum ofP2,100.00, and to pay the costs
proportionately.</p>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of this review, Atty. Antonio L. Africa was
appointed counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style=""> for </span>the
accused, upon the latter's request for such counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Counsel urges the <span style="">reversal </span>of the death sentence, and
the Solicitor-General recommends the <span class="SpellE">affir­mance</span>
thereof Counsel for the accused in a well-prepared brief, assigns the <span style="">following errors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>

<p class="BODY">The accused, having voluntarily pleaded guilty to the informa­tion
come under the firmly settled doctrine of being deemed to have admitted all the
material facts alleged in the information, including the aggravating
circumstances therein alleged.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The first error assigned that "if the original criminal
design does not clearly comprehend homicide, (in view of the allegations in the
information that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> intent was to steal
the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and that accused <span class="SpellE">Dicto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arpa</span> fired his 22 cal. revolver to scare the
passengers of the <span class="SpellE">banca</span>), but homicide follows the
robbery as an incident of the latter, the criminal acts should be viewed as
constitutive of two offenses, and not as a single special offense (of robbery
with homicide)"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 294, para­graph
1 of the Revised Penal Code which defines the special, single and indivisible
crime of robbery with homicide with the use of vio­lence against, or
intimidation of any person, imposes one distinct penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death "when by reason or on occa­sion
of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed." In the
case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> et al,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court painted out that the
"English version of the Code is a poor translation of the prevailing
Spanish text of said paragraph, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.º<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Con la <span class="SpellE">pena</span> de
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> a <span class="SpellE">muerte</span>,

<blockquote>"We see, therefore, that in order to determine the existence
of the <u>crime</u> of robbery with homicide it is enough that a homicide would
result by reason or <u>on the occasion</u> of the robbery (Decision of <span style="">the Supreme Court </span>of Spain of November
26, 1892, and January 7, 1878, quoted in 2 Hidalgo's Penal Code, p. 267 and
259-260, respectively).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This High
Tribunal speaking of the acces­sory character of the circumstances leading to
the homi­cide, has also held that it is immaterial that the death would
supervene by mere accident (Decision of Septem­ber 9, 1886; October 22, 1907;
April 30, 1910 and July 14, 1917), provided that the homicide be produced by
reason on occasion of the robbery, inasmuch as it is only the <u>result</u>
obtained, without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes,
modes or persons interven­ing in the commission of the crime, that has to be
taken into consideration (Decision of January 12, 1889 -- see <span class="SpellE">Cuello</span> <span class="SpellE">Calon's</span> <span class="SpellE">Codigo</span> Penal, <span style="">p. </span>501-504)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In that case, one of the two unidentified
co-participants of the appel­lant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> climbed
up a table and fired at the ceiling, which was conceded to be <span style="">"an </span>unpremeditated act that
surged on the spur Of the moment and possibly without any idea that Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pacson</span> was hiding therein" that resulted in the
killing of said Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pac­son</span>, but said appellant
having been shown to have participated in the criminal design to commit the
robbery with his co-defendants was held guilty of the crime of robbery with
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, upon the accused
carrying out their criminal design to steal the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span>,
one of them, <span class="SpellE">Dicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span>,
started firing his revolver to scare the passengers and fired directly at one
of the passengers, hitting him at the right shoulder, and as a result, the
three passen­gers jumped into the sea and met their death by drowning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if we were to concede appellants'
contention that their original crimi­nal design did not clearly comprehend
homicide, and that homicide followed the robbery "as an incident of the
latter”, still the deaths clearly resulted by reason of or on the occasion of
the robbery and the trial court therefore correctly found them guilty of the
crime of robbery with triple homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining errors assigned concern the trial court's a<span style="">p</span>preciation and finding of two
aggravating circumstances as against one mitigating circumstance of a voluntary
plea of guilty in the com­mission of the crime and the mandatory imposition, as
a consequence, of the penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court correctly held that the crime
committed was attended by the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, in having boarded at
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span>,
together, with other passengers bound for <span class="SpellE">Talicud</span> <span style="">Island, </span><span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
and carrying out their criminal design of stealing the said motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, once it was in the middle of the sea and when it
deve­loped engine trouble, with one of them firing revolver shots in order to
forestall any resistance, certainly cannot disclaim that they sought the
isolation of the sea to attain their criminal objective without in­terference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held by this Court in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Rubia</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the ag­gravating circumstance of the crime of homicide having been com­mitted
in an uninhabited place must be considered, where the deed was committed at
sea, where it was difficult for the offended party to receive any help, while
the assailants could easily have escaped punishment, and the purely accidental
circumstance that another <span class="SpellE">banca</span> carrying the
eyewitnesses to the crime was also at sea in the vicinity at the time without
the assailants' knowledge is no argument against the appreciation of said
circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, however, against the trial court's finding of a second
aggravating circumstance in that the crime was commit­ted "on the occasion
of a conflagration, shipwreck, earthquake, epidemic, or other calamity or
misfortune.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In so holding, the trial Court reasoned:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court believes that the development of engine trouble in the
middle of the sea is a misfortune which tends to create confusions and
apprehensions of the passengers and, thereby, to commit a crime at such a time
the accused manifested greater perversity and instead of rendering help
increased their affliction by taking advantage of the said misfortune."
(Decision, <span style="">p. 3).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The development of engine trouble at sea is a misfortune, but it
does not come within the context of the phrase "other calamity or
misfortune" as used in Article 14, paragraph 7 of the Revised Penal Code,
which refer to other conditions <span style="">of </span>distress
similar to those <span class="SpellE">precedingly</span> enumerated therein,
namely, "conflagration, shipwreck, earthquake, epidemic", such as the
chaotic conditions resulting from war or the liberation of the Philippines
during the last World War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason
for the provision of this aggravating circumstance "is found in the
debased form of criminality met in one who, in the midst of a great calamity,
instead of lend­ing aid to the afflicted, adds to their suffering by taking
advantage of their misfortune to despoil them.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, no such condi­tion of great calamity or misfortune existed when the
motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> developed engine trouble.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be added that there is nothing in the record whatever
to indicate that the engine trouble developed was a serious one such as to
create confusion and apprehension on the part of the passengers as perceived by
the trial court, and that the sane was not easily repaired; <span style="">if </span>at all, the indications are to the
contrary, for as alleged in the information, the accused succeeded in stealing
the motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> at sea.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold also against the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
claim of a second mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave
a wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court correctly held
that this circumstance could not, properly be appreciated in favor of the
accused "viewed from the nature and gravity of the offense
committed." As previously pointed out by this Court in the case of People
vs. Boyles,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the true nature of this circumstance "addresses itself to the intention of
the offender at the particular moment when he executes or commits the criminal
act; not to his intention during the planning stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, when, as in the case under review
the original plan was only to rob, but which plan, on account of the <span style="">resistance </span>offered by the victim, was
compounded into the more serious crime of robbery with homicide, the plea of
lack of <span style="">inten­</span>tion to commit so
grave a wrong cannot be rightly granted." In the present case, the accused
embarked on their most reprehen­sible criminal design of pirating a motor <span class="SpellE">banca</span> at sea, firing a volley of shots at the passengers
notwithstanding the lack of indi­cations of any resistance, thus forcing them
to jump overboard in a desperate act of self-preservation only to be swallowed
by the sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused cannot now
disclaim their lack of criminal intent and responsibility for the direct,
logical and fearsome consequences of their unlawful acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As thus established, therefore, the crime committed was Robbery
with Triple Homicide, attended by the aggravating circums­tance of the same
having been committed in an uninhabited place which is offset by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> voluntary plea of guilty, and the proper
imposable penalty is the lesser penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 294, paragraph 1 in relation to
Article 63, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
compensatory damages awarded to the heirs of the victims should properly be
increased to P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, G. R. L-18793, Oct. 11, 1968).</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that even if the accused were to be granted the
additional claimed mitigating circumstance of lack of intent, the said
imposable penalty would still be the <span style="">same.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The question of the fact of death of
the two other <span style="">passengers, since the
accused </span>deny knowledge of the fact of their death, as their counsel in
the lower court claimed that there was no showing of such fact,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
although both counsels in this Court as well as in the lower court do not
dispute the "judicial admission by the accused appellants of the fact of
killing (death) of one of the persons named in the information"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
would not affect the nature of the single and indivisible crime of Robbery with
Homicide committed by the accused nor the proper imposable penalty as herein
established, since all the homi­cides perpetrated by reason or occasion of the
robbery are merged in the composite, integrated whole that constitutes the
crime of robbery with homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, we feel constrained to add that in reviewing the
records of the case, we were struck with the paucity of facts and evidence
attending the commission of the crime other than those stated in the
information and other circumstances that would aid the Court in its ordained
task of passing <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span> upon the
legal­ity and propriety of the death penalty imposed by the trial court, e. g.
the age and education or lack thereof of the accused, and whe­ther there were
other passengers who survived, aside from the three persons named in the
information as having drowned, as well as what the crew did, <span style="">if </span>anything, during the commission of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for the
conclusion here reached of imposing .the lesser penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, by virtue of our disallowance of the
additional aggravating circumstance of calamity or misfortune found by the
trial court, we might have been constrained to remand the case for new trial to
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in order to satisfy ourselves as to the degree of
culpability of the accused in relation to the death penalty imposed, especially
since the information did not expressly designate as such the aggravating
circumstances found by the trial court and there was no discussion nor spelling
out thereof whatever in the eight-page transcript of the entire
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore reiterate the
rule of practice recommended since the early cases of <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.
  S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <span class="SpellE">Talbanos</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <st1:place>Rota</st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
set out in Rule 118, section 5 of the Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and thereafter suggested in number of

where this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is of course true that the taking of such evidence is a
matter left to the discretion of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never­theless, inasmuch as judgments of
conviction imposing the extreme penalty of death are subject to review by the
Supreme Court as law and justice shall dictate, whether the defendant appeals <span style="">or </span>not, which automatic review neither
the Court nor the accused could waive or evade it would seem that the proper
and prudent course to fol­low where the accused enters a plea of 'guilty' to
capi­tal offenses specially where he is an ignorant person with little or no
education, is to take testimony not only to satisfy the trial judge himself but
to aid the Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly
understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequences of
his plea."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision under review is modified: the
