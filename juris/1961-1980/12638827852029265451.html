<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1971</st1:date>,
or less than a year after Industrial Finance Corporation had discounted
Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba's</span> promissory note to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, the corporation sued her in the Court of First
Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 85583).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint, a printed form used by the corporation in collection
cases, is denominated "<span class="SpellE">replevin</span> with
damages".</p>

<p class="BODY">It is necessary to scrutinize the allegations of the complaint
because of the controversy between the parties as to whether, by means of that
complaint, Industrial Finance Corporation sought to foreclose the chattel
mortgage as contemplated in article 1484 of the Civil Code, formerly Act No.
4122, otherwise known as the Recto Installment Sales Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its complaint Industrial Finance Corporation prayed for <u>alternative</u>
<span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
main objective of its complaint was recovery of the mortgaged car by means of a
writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It submitted a redelivery bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Undoubtedly, the mortgagee-assignee wanted to foreclose <span class="SpellE"><u>extrajudicially</u></span> the chattel mortgage but, before it could
do so, the sheriff had to seize the car by means of the provisional remedy of
an order for the delivery of personal property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Industrial Finance Corporation prayed that, if the car could not
be recovered by means of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>, then Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> should be ordered to pay the corporation the sum of
P11<span class="GramE">,083.38</span>, plus twelve percent interest <u>per</u> <u>annum</u>,
damages, and attorney's fees in the sum of P2,770.85.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no prayer for the foreclosure of
the mortgage, a relief that should be invoked if the complaint had been filed
under section 8, Rule 68 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> in her answer merely
pleaded that Industrial Finance Corporation "waived the recovery" of
the car by accepting the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,228.67</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not state what that amount represented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the amount paid on <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1972</st1:date> by the Malayan
Insurance Co., Inc., as insurer of the mortgaged car, to Industrial Finance
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As indicated in the
computation set forth above, the corporation applied that amount to the partial
payment of Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba's</span> obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show why the insurance
company paid that amount to Industrial Finance Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba's</span> lawyer, after making
reference to the corporation's acceptance of the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,228.67</span>,
incoherently pleaded that the corporation chose to "pursue the remaining
balance of the loan <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court issued the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the sheriff was not able to seize the
mortgaged car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, there was
no extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage since, for that purpose,
possession of the car by the sheriff is necessary (<span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
Motor Co. vs. <span class="GramE">Summers</span>, 42 Phil. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> did not appear at the
pre-trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the corporation's
evidence, the trial court rendered judgment, ordering her to pay the
corporation the sum of P7<span class="GramE">,678.05</span>, plus twelve percent
interest <u>per</u> <u>annum</u> from the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No attorney's fees were awarded by the trial
court maybe because the corporation paid only ten thousand pesos for a note
valued at P13<span class="GramE">,157.89</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1973</st1:date>, or long after the
judgment had become final, she paid Industrial Finance Corporation the sum of
P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court issued writs of execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writs were returned unsatisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">A second alias writ of execution was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff was able to levy upon the
mortgaged car which was then in the possession of the <span class="SpellE">Aco</span>
Motor Service of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the execution sale held on <st1:date year="1974" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1974</st1:date> Industrial Finance
Corporation bought the mortgaged car for P4<span class="GramE">,000</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3-A, p. 72, <span class="SpellE">Expediente</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in order to take possession of the car, the corporation
had to pay P4<span class="GramE">,250</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Aco</span>
Motor Service to satisfy its lien for the repair and storage of the car.</p>

<p class="BODY">The corporation contended that, because of that payment, it
sustained a <u>loss</u> of P250 in the execution sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It asked for a third alias writ of execution
in order to satisfy the balance of Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba's</span>
obligation which, together with the 12% interest, it computed at P11<span class="GramE">,300.92</span> as of <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="9">September
 26, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span> opposed the motion for
a third alias writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="3">March 2,
 1976</st1:date> denied the motion for a third alias writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It treated the execution sale as a "virtual
foreclosure of the chattel mortgage" which, although not beneficial to the
mortgagee, Industrial Finance Corporation, barred it from recovering the
deficiency under article 1484.</p>

<p class="BODY">That order of denial is assailed by the corporation in the
instant <i>certiorari</i> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court relied on Filipinas Investment &amp; Finance Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>, L-27645, <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1969</st1:date>, 30 SCRA 564.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ridad</u></span> case, the mortgagee of a car, the
price of which was payable in installments, filed a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
suit against the mortgagor with an alternative prayer for the recovery of the
unpaid price in case the car could not be seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car was actually seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The mortgage was <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
foreclosed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court rendered
judgment against the mortgagor only for P300 as attorney's fees and P163.65 as
expenses of foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
judgment for the balance of the mortgage debt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgagors in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ridad</u></span> case
appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contested
the correctness of the judgment for P463.65 as attorney's fees and expenses for
foreclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court held that the mortgagors should pay the mortgagee
attorney's fees and expenses of foreclosure because while the mortgagors should
be protected against the rapacity of the mortgagees, the law should not be
construed as depriving the mortgagee of "protection against perverse
mortgagors" (Castro, <u>J</u>., in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ridad</u></span>
case).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that the facts of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ridad</u></span>
case are materially different from the facts of the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, there was no extrajudicial foreclosure
of the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba</span>, the mortgagee, acted perversely in not surrendering
the mortgaged car to the corporation and in preventing extrajudicial foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had she complied with the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>, then the corporation could have foreclosed the
mortgage and, in that event, she would not be liable for any deficiency.</p>

<p class="BODY">But she violated the mortgage by removing the car from her
residence at <st1:street><st1:address>3 Gladiola Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> District, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not comply with the stipulation that,
upon her default, the car should be delivered, on demand, to the mortgagee in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The corporation's action was for specific performance or
fulfillment of the obligation and not for judicial foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Alcoba's</span>
payment of P2<span class="GramE">,000</span> on account of the money judgment
against her signified that she acquiesced in the action for specific
performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cannot now be heard to
say that the judgment resulting from that action could not be enforced because
the mortgagees had opted for foreclosure of the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Code provides.</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1484.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
contract of sale of personal property the price of which is payable in installments,
the vendor may exercise any of the following remedies:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) <span class="GramE">Exact</span>
fulfillment of the obligation, should the vendee fail to pay;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">Cancel</span> the sale,
should the vendee's failure to pay cover two or more installments;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style=""> </span>Foreclose the chattel mortgage on the thing
sold, if one has been constituted, should the vendee's failure to pay cover two
or more installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, he
shall have no further action against the purchaser to recover any unpaid
balance of the price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any agreement to
the contrary shall be void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(1454-A-a)."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to article 1484, it is only when there has been a
foreclosure that the mortgagor is not liable for any deficiency.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, there was no foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagee evidently chose the remedy of
specific performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It levied upon the
car by virtue of an execution and not as an incident of a foreclosure
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is entitled to an alias
writ of execution for the portion of the judgment that has not been satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that in installment sales, if the action instituted
is for specific performance and the mortgaged property is subsequently attached
and sold, the sale thereof does not amount to a foreclosure of the
mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the seller-creditor is
entitled to a deficiency judgment (Southern Motors, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Moscoso</span>), 112 Phil. 94).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court’s order denying the motion for
a third alias writ of execution is reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against respondent
