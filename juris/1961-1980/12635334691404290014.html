<p>This is a petition for certiorari seeking to seaside the order issued ex 
<span class="SpellE">parte</span> by respondent judge on August 31, 1964 enjoining 
preliminary petitioner from acting as auditor of the Central Bank, as well as 
Auditor General Jimenez from allowing him to act in that capacity, pending 
decision on the merits of the quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> case filed 
by respondent Medrano on the ground that respondent judge has acted with grave 
abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>On August 27, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> R. Medrano filed a 
quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> case against Rafael L. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Sr., et al. before this Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> claiming, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, 
that the appointment extended to Rafael <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as 
auditor of the Central Bank be declared null and void, having been made without 
legal sanction, and that Medrano be declared entitled to that office being the 
official next higher in rank and, pending decision on the merits a writ of 
preliminary prohibitory injunction be issued ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> 
to enjoin Rafael <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, Sr. from acting as such 
auditor of the Central Bank in order to maintain the status quo of Medrano's 
position as acting auditor of the Central Bank immediately before the 
commencement of <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> usurpation of said office. 
</p>
<p>Since the prayer relative to the writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction 
ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> was granted by respondent Judge, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Dizon</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> 
interposed the present petition for certiorari. In due course, this Court issued 
the preliminary injunction prayed for.</p>
<p>The petition for quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> contains several 
causes of action. In substance, it is alleged that Medrano is the senior 
assistant auditor of the Central Bank who, since August 11, 1964, acted as 
auditor of said bank, but that on August 24, 1964 <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> usurped the position and discharged the duties thereof 
illegally to the exclusion of Medrano. And to show the illegality of the 
appointment of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> the following facts are alleged: 
Medrano was recommended on <st1:date month="3" day="4" year="1964">March 4, 
1964</st1:date> to the Auditor General to the office of auditor of the Central 
Bank by <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> before 
his retirement. Medrano appealed to the Auditor General on <st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1964">March 30, 1964</st1:date> pleading to consider his 
appointment. On <st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1964">April 1, 
1964</st1:date>, the officers of the Central Bank Staff Association, as well as 
the representatives of its Council, sent a letter to the Auditor General 
interceding for Medrano. <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>, together with 97 officials and employees of the 
office of the Auditor of the Central Bank, also appealed to the Auditor General 
recommending the promotion of Medrano.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="5" day="13" year="1964">May 13, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> retired as auditor 
of the Central Bank, on which date said office became vacant. <span class="SpellE">Heronilla</span> occupied the position in a temporary capacity.</p>
<p><span class="GramE">When <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was appointed auditor 
of the Central Bank.</span> Meantime, <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>, then 
acting auditor, took a sick leave and Medrano was designated acting auditor 
during his sick leave. On <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1964">August 22, 
1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>, pursuant to an office 
order of the Auditor General, resumed office as acting auditor of the Central 
Bank. On <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1964">August 24, 1964</st1:date>, 
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> appeared in the Office of the Central Bank and 
"began to intrude and usurp" the right of Medrano. On <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1964">August 24, 1964</st1:date>, Medrano wrote to the Governor 
of the Central Bank asking him not to recognize <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> 
as auditor. Medrano also issued an office memorandum to all officials and 
employees of the Central Bank informing them of the void appointment of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in the petition for certiorari filed by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, as well as in other pleadings filed in the instant 
case, the following facts are stated:</p>
<p>The General Auditing Office is headed by the Auditor General. Below him is 
the Deputy Auditor General, and next in rank to the latter are the auditors 
assigned to different government agencies or corporations, among which is Rafael 
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> who, before his appointment as auditor of the 
Central Bank, was the auditor of the Philippine Sugar Institute, or <span class="SpellE">Philsugin</span> for short. In the different government agencies or 
corporations where these auditors are detailed, the latter have their respective 
assistants appointed by the Auditor General, who receive less compensation than 
the auditors themselves.</p>
<p>On March 30, 1964, anticipating the retirement of <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> as auditor of the 
Central Bank, <span class="SpellE">Iluminailo</span> Medrano wrote a letter to the 
Auditor General requesting that he be appointed to said position, which request 
was unheeded in spite of other letters sent by <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> himself and the members of the Central Bank 
Staff Association endorsing Medrano's appointment. Even before the retirement of 
<span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> on <st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1964">May 
12, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> was designated acting auditor of the Central Bank 
who thenceforth discharged the functions of said office. On <st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1964">August 11, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> went on sick leave and on the same date Medrano 
was designated acting auditor until the return of <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>. On <st1:date month="8" day="21" year="1964">August 21, 1964</st1:date>, the Auditor General issued an order 
directing the immediate return of <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> to the 
Central Bank, and pursuant thereto the latter resumed office on <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1964">August 22, 1964</st1:date>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an appointment was extended to Rafael L. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as auditor of the Central Bank on <st1:date month="7" day="10" year="1964">July 10, 1964</st1:date>, which was approved by the 
Commissioner of Civil Service, said appointment to take effect upon assumption 
of duty. On <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1964">August 24, 1964</st1:date>, 
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was ordered by the Auditor General to assume 
office as auditor of the Central Bank, which he immediately heeded by taking his 
oath of office. In the same order <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> was 
directed to return to the Philippine National Bank, while the appointment of 
Medrano as acting auditor was revoked. The Auditor General also addressed a 
letter to Mr. Andres V. Castillo, Governor of the Central Bank, informing the 
latter of <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> appointment as auditor of said 
bank.</p>
<p>From the foregoing recital of facts, the following stand out as decisive and 
undisputed:</p>
<p>When <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span> 
retired on <st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1964">May 12, 1964</st1:date>, 
Medrano was merely a senior assistant auditor of the Central Bank. Upon <span class="SpellE">Mathay's</span> retirement <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span>, 
auditor of the Philippine National Bank, was designated to act in his place. 
Then <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> went on sick leave and Medrano was 
designated to act in his place until his return. On <st1:date month="8" day="21" year="1964">August 21, 1964</st1:date>, the Auditor General directed <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> to resume office as acting auditor of Central 
Bank, and in an office order issued by the Auditor General <span class="SpellE">Beronilla</span> was directed to return to the Philippine National 
Bank while the appointment of Medrano as acting auditor was revoked. Meanwhile, 
or on <st1:date month="7" day="19" year="1964">July 19, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was appointed auditor of the Central Bank, his 
appointment having been duly approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service. And 
on <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1964">August 24, 1964</st1:date>, upon 
direction of the Auditor General, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> took his oath 
and assumed his duties as such auditor.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that when Medrano filed the present Petition for quo 
<span class="SpellE">warranto</span> he was merely a senior assistant auditor of 
the Central Bank, while <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was already the auditor 
thereof duly appointed by the Auditor General. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> 
was then holding and discharging the duties of that office. Verily, until proven 
otherwise, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is the one entitled to continue 
holding that office as well as to discharge its functions and duties, pending 
trial and decision on the merits of the quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> 
case. Hence, it would appear to be a grave abuse of discretion on the part of 
respondent judge to have issued the writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction 
in question without first considering the merits of said case, or without giving 
the parties an opportunity to present evidence thereon. In fine, said writ was 
issued without Medrano having any existing right to protect.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p><span class="GramE">" 'The</span> existence of a right violated is a 
prerequisite to the granting of an injunction. * * * A permanent injunction 
should not be awarded except in a clear case and to prevent irreparable injury.' 
(32 C.J., 34-36.)</p>
<p><span class="GramE">" 'A</span> court of chancery will not entertain a bill to 
enforce a mere valueless abstract right, and the court will, on its own motion, 
raise the point for its own protection.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Duznom</span> vs. Thomsen, 58 111.</span> <span class="GramE">App., 
390.)</span></p>
<p>"None of these requisites is present in the instant case. There has been a 
failure to establish either the existence of a clear and positive right of the 
plaintiff specially calling for a judicial protection through an extraordinary 
writ of the kind applied for, or that the defendant has committed or attempts to 
commit any act which has endangered or tends to endanger the existence of said 
right, or has injured or threatens to injure the same." (North <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Sugar Co. vs. 
<st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>, 63 Phil., 664, 671)</p>
<p>"Injunction, like other equitable remedies, will issue only at the instance 
of a suitor who has sufficient title or interest in the right or property sought 
to be protected. He must stand on the strength of his own right or title, rather 
than on the weakness of that claimed by his adversary. An impending or 
threatened invasion of some legal right of the complainant, and some interest in 
pre" venting the wrong sought to be perpetrated must be shown. <span class="GramE">It 's</span> always a ground for denying injunction that the party 
seeking has not sufficient title or interest to sustain it, and no claim to the 
ultimate relief sought—in other words, that he shows no equity. Want of equity 
on the part of the plaintiff in attempting to use the injunctive process of the 
court to enforce a mere barren right will justify the court in refusing the 
relief even though the defendant has little equity on his side. The 
complainant's right or title, moreover, must be clear and unquestioned, for 
equity, as a rule, will not take cognizance of disputes respecting title, and 
will not lend its preventive aid by injunction where the complainant's title or 
right is doubtful or disputed." (28 Am. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jur</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> p. 
218)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"In judicial proceedings, no one can be heard to complain unless he can show 
that he has been injured. Accordingly, one who seeks injunctive relief in a 
court of equity must satisfy the court, not only that he has a clear right of a 
character which equity will protect, but also that the act or acts complained of 
constitute an injurious invasion of that right which will result in or threatens 
actual and substantial damage." (Idem., pp. 220-221)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that Medrano claims that as senior assistant auditor of the 
Central Bank he is entitled under the law to fill the vacancy by the retirement 
of <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Mathay</span>, but <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> claims otherwise, and on this point he advances points 
which are worthy of note. Medrano also has points in his favor which likewise 
deserve to be reckoned with. He even now claims that he had been appointed 
auditor of the Central Bank even if he has not adduced any pertinent documentary 
proof. But all these evidentiary matters can best be considered after this case 
is tried on the merits rather than in this instance bearing in mind merely the 
allegations in the pleadings filed in connection with the present petition.</p>
<p>In view hereof, we are of the considered opinion that the writ of preliminary 
injunction issued by respondent judge should be set aside without prejudice to 
whatever relief that may be warranted after the quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> case shall have been tried and decided on the 
merits.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of respondent judge dated August 311 1964 which 
grants ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> the writ of preliminary <span class="GramE">Prohibitory</span> injunction is hereby set aside. Respondent court 
is hereby directed to try and decide the quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> 
case on the merits. The writ issued by this Court is dissolved. No costs.</p>
