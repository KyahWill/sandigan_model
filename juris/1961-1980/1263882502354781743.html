as a Radio Operator of the Bureau of Telecommunications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1969, he was found sick by Dr. Juan F.

 29, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner

awarded disability benefits to petitioner in the sum of P3,598.82 as authorized
by Sections 14 and 18 of Act 3428, as amended; P179.79 as attorney's fees as
authorized by Section 31 and the sum of P36.00 as administrative fees required
by Section 55 of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the
decision was received by the Office of the Solicitor General on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="10"><span style="">October
 17, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 19, 1975, the latter filed with
the Workmen's Compensation Commission a petition to elevate records of the case
for relief from judgment alleging that "due to the volume and pressure of
work" in the preparation of government briefs to be filed before the
Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals and because he had to attend to hearing
of cases, "the decision in question was not acted upon immediately or
within the period required for filing a Motion for Reconsideration." On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="1"><span style="">January
 6, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
Commission ordered the elevation of the records and on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="1"><span style="">January
 28, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> rendered a
decision disallowing the claim of petitioner for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner argues that
respondent Commission erred in granting respondent Republic's petition to
elevate records despite the absence of any justifiable ground and further
compounded its error by deciding the case on the merits notwithstanding the
finality of the Acting Referee's decision dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="9"><span style="">September 29, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We sustain petitioner's
argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the Office of the
Solicitor General was not served with a notice of the injury or illness and/or
claim for compensation, as required by Circular No. 69 of the General Auditing
Office</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> yet the records show that there was notice
of the injury or illness of the petitioner on respondent Republic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that General Auditing Office
Circular No. 69, dated October 6, 1959, requires that claims against the
Government should be transmitted to the Solicitor General in his capacity as counsel
for the National Government, there is, however, Memorandum Circular No. 210,
issued by the Office of the President, which provides, among others:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In order to properly safeguard the interests and preserve the
rights of the Government as an employer under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
the following rules governing <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> are,
therefore, hereby promulgated:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) The duty to submit the notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
devolves upon the head of the office or agency concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases where there are regional offices or
branches, notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> shall be made by
the head of office thereof, who shall at the same time furnish a copy of the
same to the central office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such notice
of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> shall be accomplished in the
"Employees Report of Accident or Sickness," form prescribed by the
Bureau of Workmen's Compensation which may <span class="SpellE">xxxx</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">If
under the foregoing rule regarding the filing of the notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> to the claim of petitioner, the duty to
submit the notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> devolves upon the
heads of department, bureaus or offices concerned, then by the force of logic,
the notice and claim of illness or injury should be served upon him also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is when the bureau or office decides to controvert
the claim that the report or answer with <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
must go through the Office of the Solicitor General so that the latter can
properly represent it in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where, however, the employing office decides not to controvert the
claim, there will be no need to course the claim to </span><span style="">the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The standing practice would seem to be that
the Solicitor General upon receipt of the notice and claim for compensation,
merely transmits the same for comment to the bureau or office concerned, at the
same time registering with the Labor Regional Office concerned its general <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> without any actual knowledge of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
kind of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> is not based on the facts of
which the Solicitor General, has knowledge and therefore void or invalid for
being hearsay.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is to be noted that the Workmen's
Compensation Commission issued a circular on January 22, 1973 which provides
that "In all claims for compensation against the Republic of the
Philippines, the Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Section or Unit shall see
to it that a copy of the notice and claim for compensation is transmitted to
the Office of the Solicitor General in its capacity as counsel for the National
Government even if the claim is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Violation of this mandatory requirement may
subject the officer to administrative action as hinted in the case of Republic
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> (Department of Justice vs. WCC &amp; <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Azaña</span>, G.R. No. 29019,
May 18, 1972).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be readily seen
that said circular merely requires that a copy be sent to the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is doubted whether the
failure on the part of the Chief of the Regional Office to comply with said
requirement will render the decision of the Regional Office invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most it will expose the head of the office
to administrative action but cannot nullify the decision of the Regional
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold that failure to send a
copy of the notice of the claim of illness or injury to the Solicitor General
will render the decision of the Regional Office null and void, will place the
laborer at a disadvantage contrary to the avowed objectives of Act 3428, as
amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in <u>Republic
(Department of Justice) vs. WCC &amp; <span class="SpellE">Azaña</span></u>,
disregard by the Officer concerned of the provisions of law govern­ing the
transmittal of claims against the Government should not prejudice the claimant
worker or employee, who has no control over the said official, and whom the
Workmen's Compensation Act so clearly aims to protect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic's remedy is to proceed administratively
against the officer concerned for violation of the regulations involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

only in exceptional cases and only in case there is no available remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there is another remedy at law, it

relief is not regarded with favor and judgment should not be avoided where the
complaining party has, or by <u>exercising proper diligence</u> would have had,
an adequate remedy at law, or by proceeding in the original action, by motion,
