<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This was followed by a formal claim for
P850.31, the total value of the missing packages - P739.34 on bill of lading
173 as "evidenced by Debit Note No. 1753-B (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

"evidenced by Debit Note <span style="color: windowtext;">No.

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1960</st1:date>
the plaintiff, The Liverpool &amp; Lon­don &amp; Globe Insurance Co., Ltd., as
insurer-<span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> of the consignee, filed the present
action with the municipal court of Manila, to recover from the defendants the
total value of the missing packages plus legal interest thereon, P300 as <span style="">attorney's </span>fees and for expenses of
litigation, and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Upon </span><span style="">a </span>written stipulation of facts submitted by the parties, the <span style="">municipal court
rendered judgment </span><span style="">in favor of
the plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila, upon the same
stipulation of facts, rendered judgment</p>

<blockquote>"*** <span style="">in </span>favor of the plaintiff and against
the de­fendants, ordering them to pay the former, jointly and severally, the
total sum of P850.31 with interest thereon at the rate of six (6) per cent per
annum from December 20, 1960, the date of the fil­ing of the complaint, until
the principal shall have been fully paid, plus the sum of P300.00 as attorney's
<span style="">fees </span>of
the plaintiff and the costs of the suit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is first contended
by the appellants that the <span style="">pro­visional
</span>claim in question is not a valid one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is argued that to have a proper suit against the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator <span style="">under </span>paragraph 15 of
the management contract, it is necessary <span style="">that
</span>the provisional claim be one for value; that the statement in<span style=""> </span>the claim that the shipment is
"short-landed and/or landed <span style="">in </span>bad
order" is vague and misleading, and does not indicate <span style="">the </span>value of the missing packages;
that no invoices or proof of the purchase price of the lost cargo are attached
thereto; <span style="color: windowtext;">and that the formal claim which was made on July 25, 1960, or seven
months after the date of last discharge on December 20, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">1959,
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">was filed too late.</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the provisional claim did not state the value of the
missing packages, the words "short-landed and/or land­ed in bad
order", together with the specific reference there­in to bills of lading
173 and 174, sufficiently placed the defendants on notice as to the nature and
character of the claim, and provided them with ample basis for reasonable
verification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances, as we
have heretofore in many cases already held, constitute substantial compliance
with paragraph 15 of the management contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The subsequent filing of the formal claim seven months after the
date of last discharge from the carrying vessel had no effect on the timeliness
of the provisional claim which was made only four days after the date of last
discharge from the vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. On the matter of the period within which an action should be
brought, <span style="">we </span>held in Alpha
Insurance &amp; Surety Co. vs. Manila Port Service, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that</p>

<blockquote>"Paragraph 15 of the management contract provides two
alternative periods in reference to an action to be filed to enforce liability
for loss or damage:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) one year from
the date of last discharge of the goods, or (2) one year from the date the
claim is rejected or denied by the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator,
provided, however, that a provisional claim shall have been previously filed
with said operator within 15 days from the date of last dis­charge from the
carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first period refers
to a case where the claimant files an action in court without awaiting the
contractor's pleasure on the claim, in which event the action should be filed
within one year from the date of last dis­charge from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second period applies where the claimant
prefers to wait for de­finitive action by the operator, in which event the
action should be filed within one year from the date of rejection."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
availed of the first alternative period:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"one year from the date of last discharge of the goods.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last discharge was completed on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="12">December 20,<span style=""> </span>1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
present action which was filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1960</st1:date>, or the last day of the prescriptive period, <span style="">is </span>therefore
not time-barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. It is further contended by the appellants that their
liability, if any, should be only P696.47, the invoice value of the undelivered
packages, pursuant to section 15 of the management contract, and not the c.i.f.
value thereof of P850.31, the amount awarded by the court <u style="">a</u> <u style="">quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is likewise without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The written stipulation of facts here controlling indeed states
in part that "the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> fee paid by the <span style="">consignee </span>was
computed on the weight and measurement of the shipment and not on the value
thereof".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, therefore,
the consignee cannot demand the full undeclared value of the lost <span style="">cargo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"* * * it may be stated that appellant
could ade­quately protect itself, by simply specifying or manifesting the
actual value of it under the law [Import entry (Sec. 1267, Rev. Adm. Code);
writ­ten declaration (Sec. 1268-6, in connection with <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
1269 and 1271, Rev. Adm. Code)], and paying the corresponding <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> charges of the same, pursuant to the provisions of
said paragraph 15, and of the 'Important Notice' contained in the Delivery Permit
and Gate Pass which its repre­sentative or broker accepts, signs, and utilizes,
upon taking delivery of the imported cargo from <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, in which event, the latter
expressly binds itself and undertakes to reimburse appellant the actual value
of the cargo, in case of its damage, destruction, or loss while under its
custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If appellant failed to so
state the value of its merchandise in any of these documents required by law
before it cleared its goods, and paid only the <span class="SpellE">arestre</span>
charge based on a lesser value, it cannot in justice now demand the full
undeclared value.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> (<span class="GramE">emphasis</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The reason for this rule is stated in
Northern Motors, Inc. <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">vs</span>. </span>Prince
Line, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * Among the conditions imposed by
law for this purpose is for the owner or consignee to submit to the collector
of Custom a written declaration containing, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
a 'just and faithful ac­count of the actual cost of said merchandise, including
and specifying the value of all containers or coverings, and that nothing has
been omitted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> or concealed whereby the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines might be defrauded of any part of
the duties lawfully due on the merchandise.’”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be pointed out, however, that under paragraph 15 of the
management contract the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator <span style="">is res­</span>ponsible not only for the
invoice value of the goods in case of loss <span style="">thereof, but</span> also for all damages sustained on account of such
loss.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no question that in addition to the actual cost of the missing
packages, insurance and freight charges thereon were paid by the consignee in
connection with their importation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
said insurance and freight charges are actual damages collectible under
paragraph 15 of the said ma­nagement contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is quite obvious that it would be more favorable to
the defendants for them to pay to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the
full value of the lost cargo in the total sum of P850.31, than for the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to insist on the enforcement of the limited
liability clause in paragraph 15 of the management contract which allows the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to collect “<u>five hundred pesos (P500.00) for
each package</u>”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in the latter
situation, the appellants, instead of paying only P850.31, would then have to
pay to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,500</span> (5 lost packages x P500 for each package).</p>

<p class="BODY">4. The award of P300 as attorney's fees is not inordinate,
considering the high professional standing of the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
counsel of record which successfully prosecuted this case from the municipal
court through the CFI to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u style="">a</u>
<u style="">quo</u> <span style="">is
</span>affirmed <u style="">in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u style="">toto</u></span>, at defendants-appellants’ cost.</p>
