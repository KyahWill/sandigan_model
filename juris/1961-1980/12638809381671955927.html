				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The facts of this <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i>
proceedings are simple and uncomplicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> having on
September 30, 1970 rendered a decision in favor of petitioner against private
respondents, the spouses Jose <span class="SpellE">Recoleto</span> and Judith A. <span class="SpellE">Recoleto</span>, in an action for the recovery of a portion of Lot
No. 1357 of the <span class="SpellE">Banilad</span> Friar Lands Estate in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, the latter filed on January 21, 1971 a notice of
appeal and thereafter on January 28, 1971, a record on appeal, which did not
state when such decision was received by them.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then on <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1971</st1:date>,
they filed a motion "seeking to detach and substitute page 3 of the record
on appeal, by offering to change it with a new page, which would add the phrase
'and which decision was received by plaintiffs on <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1971</st1:date>.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Such <span style="">a </span>motion was denied by the lower court on <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="2">February 20, <span style="">1971</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>acting favorably on an opposition of

It was <span style="">thus a </span>record on appeal
that did not show when the decision was received that was transmitted to
respondent Court of Appeals, but it denied nonetheless petitioner's motion to
dismiss appeal in its Resolution of May 27, 1971,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>sustaining the opposition filed by

opposition appears to be well-founded, motion to dismiss appeal is [denied];

'and which decision was received by the plaintiff on January 7, 1971' on par.

petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court did not commit a grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition must be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. This is the opening paragraph of the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma in the Krueger decision: "This is another
case covered by the liberalized interpretation and application of the 'material
data rule' enunciated in recent decisions of this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The facts of the case correspond to that in the present litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Krueger as plaintiff-appellant
failed to state the date he received the decision appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, there was a motion to dismiss
such a pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court of
Appeals, through its Ninth Division, issued the challenged resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1975</st1:date> granting such a
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was reversed by this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the opinion of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma: "We now find and so hold
that petitioner Frank Krueger is deserving of relief."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
She pointed out that the once prevailing doctrine as to the literal adherence
to the material data rule being of mandatory and jurisdictional character,
first announced in Government v. Antonio,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
has been eroded considerably by the more recent decisions of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference was made by her to <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span> v. Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as reflecting this new trend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should
be said that such a tendency is discernible as far back as Design Masters v.
Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, in an opinion of former Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
reversed the Court of Appeals for granting a motion to dismiss upon the ground
that nowhere in the record on appeal does the date of its filing appear
although said date is stamped on the first page of the original record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
explained why: "The printed record on appeal in L-31510 does not show the
date on which it was filed with the trial court, but such date is stamped on
the original record on appeal, which was approved by said court and forwarded
to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6, Rule
41 of the Rules of Court, obviously refers to the record on appeal filed with
the trial court, not to the record on appeal printed in the appellate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the Court of Appeals
is in a position to determine the date aforementioned, by examining the
original record on appeal thereto, forwarded, and, hence, forming part of its
own records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, petitioner's
record on appeal meets the objective of said provision of the Rules of Court,
which may be deemed to have been substantially complied with."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The rigidity of a previous doctrine was thus subjected to an inroad under the
concept of substantial compliance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
a ruling was followed in Ever Ice Drop and Ice Cream Factory v. Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, categorically stated: "Clearly, therefore,
the alleged failure of petitioners to comply with Section 6 of Rule 41 found by
the Court of Appeals would be true only, if the printed joint record on appeal
alone is used as basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually,
however, the original thereof on file also with said appellate court bears out
the contention of counsel that petitioners' notice of appeal and joint record
on appeal are in order."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
He then referred to the Design Masters opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, such a ruling was cited with approval in <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>
v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by the then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice,
Castro.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. There is no doubt, however, that as pointed out by Justice <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, after <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span>
this Court has consistently applied the liberal doctrine whenever the material
data rule is invoked to dismiss an appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The latest decision in point, <span class="SpellE">Libongco</span> v. Court of
Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
was promulgated on <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the material data allegedly
omitted in the record on appeal consisted of the resolution of the entire court
on the defendant's alleged motion for extension of time to file his record on
appeal and the date when the defendant received a copy of such resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After referring to <span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span>
and five other cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, ruled:
"In view thereof, the respondent Court of Appeals did not commit an error,
much less abuse its discretion, in denying the petitioners' motion to dismiss
the appeal of the defendant Raul <span class="SpellE">Casumpang</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
So we rule again.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. There is even less justification for another ground invoked by
petitioner to manifest what he considered a grave abuse of discretion on the
part of respondent Court of Appeals when according to him, private respondents
in submitting their mimeographed record on appeal added a new page not found in
the typewritten record on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Ever alert to detect any procedural irregularity, petitioner filed anew a
motion to dismiss appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Court, in a resolution of October 26, 1971, denied petitioner's
motion in a minute resolution notable for its adherence to the law and sound
procedural principles: "[Resolved]:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Denied; the main point has already been ruled upon in the resolution of
2 September, 1971, page 167; and this Court does not see its way clear to
changing its former position; as to the fact that appellants added in the mimeo­graphed
Record on Appeal the names of all the defendants, yes, this is a defect, and
therefore, such additional names should be as they are hereby ordered to be,
stricken out, but this defect is not jurisdictional, and this Court does not
believe that it would be enough to justify dismissal of the appeal."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
It would be to magnify a trifle to dismiss an appeal based on such allegation.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. It is not amiss to refer to this excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
"This Court, as is thus evident, has been quite consistent in preserving
the right to appeal and has viewed with disfavor attempts on the part of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to denigrate its effectiveness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is in line with the basic postulate that
the system of procedure, to quote from <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, 'is
perverted from its proper function when it multiplies impediments to justice
without the warrant of clear necessity.' So it has been in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the leading case of Alonso v. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, a 1910
decision, with Justice Moreland correctly stressing: 'Technicality, when it
deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance
and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from courts.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>
