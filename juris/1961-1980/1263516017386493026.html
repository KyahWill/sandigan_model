of the Workmen's Compensation Com­mission dismissing the claim of Julian Abana<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for compensation benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stripped of non-essentials, the undisputed facts as found by
Hearing Officer Pedro P. Pelaez of Labor Regional Office No. 4, and adopted by
the Workmen's Compensation Commission, are hereunder re­told:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent, Francisco
Quisumbing, is the proprietor of the Dollar Taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, Ju­lian Abana, had been
employed by him as taxi driver since </span><st1:date year="1952" day="13" month="2"><span style="">February 13, 1952</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before his employment as </span>such, Abana was required to submit
himself to physi­cal examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime on <st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="8">August 21,
 1958</st1:date>, the petitioner, upon arrival home from work, had a heart
attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His family brought him
immediately to the Philippine General Hospital where <span class="GramE">he</span>
was confined for five days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His chief
complaints were difficulty of breathing and chest pains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resident physicians who treated him
diagnosed his illness as "congestive heart fail­ure,
hypertensive".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Abana had been
discharged from the hospital, he rested for a few weeks at home, and when his
health had improved, he reported for work again, informing the manager of the
Dollar Taxi that the cause for his absence was that he had been stricken of
heart disease.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1959, Abana had another heart attack while driving
his taxi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, his heart ailment
recurred very often causing him to be checked up and treated at the dispensary
of the Philippine General Hospital from time to time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was established that everytime the heart ailment of the
petitioner recurred, it prevented him from doing his task as taxi driver, but,
however, he always reported the matter to his manager, asking either for sick
or vacation leave with pay, which pay, unfortunately, was never granted him. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He was given some small amounts, though, in
the form of <u>vales</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite
respondent's knowledge, however, of the al­ready weakened or diseased heart of
the claimant (resulting to his permanent total and indefinite in­capacity for
labor) and demands for sickness bene­fits, the former never gave the latter any
benefits nor <span style="">reimbursed him the amount
incurred for medical expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of petitioner's deteriorating health condition caused by
his heart ailment, he could no longer endure to work <span style="">as taxi </span>driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Jan­uary, 1961, he had not been to
resume work, nor <span style="">could he perform any
kind of work which entails phy­sical and mental fatigue or stress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the above facts, the hearing officer rendered
judgment declaring petitioner's illness to be compensable under the law, and
thereby ordered his employer to pay him the sums of P3,057.60 and P500.00 as
compensation benefits and medical expenses, respectively; to provide him with
medical, hospital, and surgical services and supplies until claimant's illness
shall have been pronounced to be medically cured or arrested; and to pay office
fees pursuant to the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">As indicated in the beginning, the Workmen's Compensation
Commission reversed the findings of the Hearing Officer and thereby dismissed
the peti­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question presented is whether or not the petitioner is
entitled to disability benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act by reason
of the heart ailment which he contracted during his employ­ment with
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
dismissing the claim for compensation proceeds upon the idea that the causal
connection between petitioner's work and his ill­ness has not been sufficiently
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that
driving a taxicab for long hours in Manila and suburbs, including all its
incidents, such as going through the congested traffic and helping passengers
load and unload their baggage, causes severe strain and tension, and that it
does aggravate a heart condition.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the record shows that petitioner's
heart ailment occurred for the first time in 1958, while he was already an
employee of the respondent, we make the conclusion that it was at least
aggravated by his work.</p>

<p class="BODY">While there is that possibility that factors other than the
employment of the claimant may also have contributed to the aggravation of his
illness, <span style="">this is not a drawback to its
compensability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, under the law, it
is not required that the employ­ment be the sole factor in the growth, development
or acceleration of claimant's illness to entitle him to the benefits provided
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that his employment
had contributed, even in a small de­gree, to the development of the
disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been repeatedly held
that under the Workmen's Com­pensation Law, it is not necessary for a claimant
to carry the burden of proof to establish his case to the point of
demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient to show
that the hypothesis </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">which he bases his claim is probable.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Viewing the case from a
different angle, the exact medical cause of the illness, however is not really
significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, granting, only for
argument's sake, that the evidence for petitioner is in­sufficient to show a
causal link between the nature of his employment and his heart ailment, under
the provision of section 44 of the Workmen's Compensa­tion Act, as amended,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> it is to be presumed that petitioner's
illness, which supervened at the time of his employment, either arose out of,
or was at least aggravated by, said employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With this legal presumption, the burden of proof shifts to the employer,
and the employee </span><span style="">is relieved </span><span style="">of the burden to show causation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We </span><span style="">fail to find in the record any substantial evidence adduced by
respondent em­ployer tending to disprove causal connection between claimant's
heart ailment and his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mere opinion of doctors presented by petitioner as evidence cannot prevail over
the presumption estab­lished by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent contends, as he did in the Commis­sion, that the
claim of petitioner has prescribed since no notice of the sickness or claim for
compen­sation within the period fixed by law was filed by the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This defense is not tenable since the
respondent had actual knowledge of claimant's ill­ness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that "everytime the
heart disease of the claimant recurred, it prevented him to do his task as taxi
driver, but, however, he al­ways reported the matter to the management asking
either sick or vacation leave with pay."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under this circumstance, notice of injury or sickness would be
superfluous.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically a social legislation de­signed to
give relief to workmen, the Workmen's Com­pensation Act must be liberally
construed to attain the purpose for which it was enacted.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

subject of dispute between the parties, <span class="GramE">We</span> shall not
