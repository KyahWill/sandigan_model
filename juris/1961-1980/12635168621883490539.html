this petition for the cancellation of a utility model patent for a Side
Tilting-Dumping Wheelbarrow granted to respondent Felipe A. <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
was correctly denied by respondent Director of Patents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Gerardo Samson, Jr., himself the
grantee of a utility model patent for a Dumping and Detachable Wheelbarrow,
lacked any legal justification for such a plea.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">So respondent Director ruled.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied, petitioner elevated the matter
to us for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason why
a different outcome is to be expected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His appeal must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was, on May 22, 1958, awarded Utility Model Patent No.
27 for the above type of wheelbarrow which, as noted in the decision,
"consists of a wheeled carriage base and an upper pivoted and detachable
carrying tray.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carriage base is
comprised of a wheel and two equal lengths of continuous pipes bent to provide
wheel forks at the front and at the rear to support the back portion of the
tray, with the ends of the pipes being adopted as the carrying handles for the
wheelbarrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two pipes thus bent are
joined together by cross braces in the front and at the rear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tray is <span class="SpellE">removably</span>
pivoted at its front end through hook catches at its bottom corners, to the
forward cross brace, and its rear end rests solidly over the rear portion of
the legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To dump the load the user
pulls a dumping handle at the back end to cause the tray to pivot upwardly
about the front brace to a position of about 45 degrees with the horizontal and
with its front end panel being supported by the wheel."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent's Side
Tilting-Dumping Wheelbarrow, on the other hand, consists "of a wheeled
carriage made of tubular frames essentially as in <span class="GramE">petitioner's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Welded transversely to </span>the parallel
frames are two brackets provided with holes designed to complement similar
holes on brackets provided on the tray.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The brackets on the tray are so placed that with the provision of a bolt
through the openings the tray may be tilted approximately 170 degrees to the
left or to the right of the wheelbarrow with its axis running longitudinally
through the center of the bottom face of the tray."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is an express recognition under the Patent Law, as already
noted, that any new model of implements or tools or of any industrial product
even if not possessed of the quality of invention but which is of
"practical utility" is entitled to a "patent for a utility
model." From the above description of the side tilting-dumping
wheelbarrow, the product of respondent's ingenuity <span style="">and industry, it is quite apparent that it has a place in the market
and possesses what the statute refers to as "practical utility." The
requirement explicitly set forth in the statute has thus been met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
is entitled to its benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grant
to him of a patent for a utility model is in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no reason, therefore, for its
cancellation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was held by the
Director of Patents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That decision as
already noted should stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, in appeals from
a decision of the Director of Patents, only questions of law may be reviewed,
findings of facts being conclusive unless unsupported by substantial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was decided in <span class="SpellE">Che</span> v. Philippines Patent Office.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="GramE">As was emphasized in <span class="SpellE">Bagano</span> v. Director of Patents:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is almost trite to state here that
in cases of the nature as the one at bar, only questions of law are to be
raised in order that this Court could exercise its appellate jurisdiction and
review the decision."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The above well-settled doctrines suffice to
demonstrate that this petition for review, as noted at the outset, is without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not error then, to
reiterate, for the respondent Director of Patents to deny the cancellation of
the utility patent granted respondent <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To borrow from the language of the <span class="SpellE">Che</span> opinion:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Even on the sole issue alone, the petition for review must
fail."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another alleged error was
imputed to respondent Director of Patents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would find fault with his failing to hold that respondent <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span> "was not the true and actual" author of
the mechanical contrivance for which he was granted a utility model
patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what the appealed
decision has to say on this point:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Petitioner's theory with respect to the second ground for
cancellation, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that respondent is
not the true and actual inventor or designer of the utility model is premised
on the fact that because of the proximity of the two, the petitioner and the
respondent being brothers-in-law, and living in adjoining residential lots, the
latter has had ample time and opportunity to observe and copy the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> wheelbarrow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the testimonial evidence thus presented is not clear, satisfactory,
and free from doubt, in the face of allegations to the contrary by the
respondent."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The futility of such an assignment of error
is thus apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it is factual
in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not for us, as noted
above, to review or revise the same, there being no showing of a lack of
substantial evidence in support thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Director of Patents denying the petition for the cancellation of Utility Model
Letters Patent No. 62 in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Tarroza</span>
