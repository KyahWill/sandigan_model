HON. ERNESTO P. VALENCIA (JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF AURORA
SUB-PROVINCE), FLOR­ENCIO DAGUMAN, AND HON. ARTEMIO N. VILLANUEVA (ACTING MUNICIPAL
JUDGE, SAN LUIS, QUEZON), RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this present petition for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus
with preliminary injunction, the People of the Philip­pines, represented by the
acting assistant provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
province, seeks a reversal of the order of the respondent Judge Ernesto P.
Valencia of the Court of First Instance of Auro­ra sub-province dismissing the
appeal lodged with the said court by the accused <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daguman</span> (co-respondent herein), upon motion of the
latter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Daguman</span> was charged in the municipal
court of San Luis in three separate cases with illegal possession of firearms,
as­sault against an agent of a person in authority, and slander, res­pectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a joint trial of these cases, the
municipal court rendered judgment on <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1964">July
 7, 1964</st1:date> convicting him of illegal pos­session of firearms, and
sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for a period of two years and one day to
five years and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
charges of assault and slander were dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date month="7" day="15" year="1964">July 15, 1964</st1:date> he
filed his notice of appeal wherein he manifested his intention to appeal to the
Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">An information was thereafter filed a new in the CFI of Aurora
sub-province on October 20, 1964, charging <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span>
with the crime of illegal possession of firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before arraignment, however, he moved for the
dismissal of his appeal on the ground that it is the Court of Appeals and not
the Court of First Instance which has appellate jurisdiction, invoking <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span><u> v. Avila</u>, G.R. No. L-­25922, <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="12" year="1968">February 12, 1968</st1:date>
the Hon. Judge Ernesto Valencia issued an order dismissing the appeal for lack
of jurisdiction, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, as prayed for by the accused thru counsel, for
lack of jurisdiction, the appeal in this case is dismissed and the Deputy Clerk
of Court is directed to return the record of this case to the court of
origin."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the record of the case from the CFI of Auro­ra
sub-province, the municipal court of San Luis set the case for "hearing."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1968"><span style="">A</span>ugust 22, 1968</st1:date> the
present petition was lodged in this Court for review of respondent Judge <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, as well as the order of
respon­dent municipal court of San Luis setting the case for "hearing."
The issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction was prayed for to restrain
respondent municipal court from proceeding, which writ we issued on <st1:date month="8" day="23" year="1968">August 23, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole' issue posed by this petition is: which court has
appellate jurisdiction over a decision rendered by an <u>ordinary</u> mu­nicipal
court (i.e., municipal court of a municipality which is nei­ther a provincial
nor a sub-provincial capital) in a criminal case which is within the confluence
of jurisdiction of ordinary municipal courts and courts of first instance?</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that in this case appellate jurisdic­tion
properly pertains to the court of first instance, primarily be­cause the
proceedings are not recorded, and should appeal be ta­ken to the Court of
Appeals or the Supreme Court directly, there is no recorded evidence to
consider on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner fur­ther
cites sec. 5 of Rule 123 of the New Rules of Court which pro­vides:</p>

<blockquote>"Appeal from judgment of the justice of the peace or municipal
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The convicted party may appeal
either orally or in writing from any fin­al judgment of the justice of the
peace or municipal <span style="">court in a criminal
cause to the Court of First Ins­tance within fifteen (15) days from the
promulgation of the judgment."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent CFI Judge,
on the other hand, invokes sec. 14, Rule 122 of the New Rules of Court which
recites:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appeal. - From all final judgments of the Court of First
Instance or courts of similar juris­diction, and in all cases in which the law
now pro­vides for appeals from said courts, an appeal may be taken to the Court
of Appeals or to the Supreme Court as hereinafter prescribed,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and
reasons that since "the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace [now
municipal judges] and judges of municipal courts [now city judges] over criminal
cases enumerated in paragraph (c) [now pa­ragraph (b)] of Section 87 of
Republic Act No. 296 is not exclusive but concurrent with the Court of First
Instance (People v. <span class="SpellE">Palmon</span>, <u>supra</u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">)<u> </u>the jurisdiction of Courts of First
Instance and Municipal Courts, therefore, are <u>similar</u>, so that cases
falling under said paragraph are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly
to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court as the case may be, hence, the
ruling of the Hon­orable Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span>
v. Avila, <u>supra</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">"<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We uphold the
petitioner's position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under par. 9 of section
87(b) of the Judiciary Act, as amen­ded, municipal judges and judges of city
courts of chartered cities are vested with original jurisdiction over the crime
of illegal pos­session of firearms, explosives and ammunition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This offense is punishable by imprisonment of
not less than one year and one day nor more than five years, or both such
imprisonment and a fine of not less than P1, 000 nor more than P5, 000, in the
discretion of the court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is true that Rep. Act 3828 limits the
criminal jurisdic­tion of municipal courts to crimes punishable by the maximum
pe­nalty of imprisonment of not more than three years or a fine of not more
than three thousand pesos or both such fine and imprisonment,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but this jurisdiction has been broadened,
first, by section 87(b) of the Judiciary Act which gives municipal judges and
judges of city courts of chartered cities original jurisdiction over the crimes
therein enumerated regardless of penalty,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and second, by the pe</span>nultimate
paragraph of section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act which vests municipal judges in
the capitals of provinces and sub-provinces and judges of city courts with like
jurisdiction as the courts of first instance to try parties charged with
offenses com­mitted within their respective jurisdictions for which the penalty
provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> or impri­sonment of not more than <span style="">six </span>years
or a fine not exceeding six thousand pesos, or both.</p>

<p class="BODY">Courts of First Instance, on the other hand, are vested with
original jurisdiction over all criminal cases in which the pe­nalty provided <span style="">by </span>law is
imprisonment of more than six months or a fine of more than two hundred pesos,
or both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a number of cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court has harmonized section 87(b) with section 44 of the Judiciary <span style="">Act, </span>as
amended, in the sense that insofar as the criminal cases enumerated in section
87(b) are concerned, there is concurrence of jurisdiction between courts of
first ins­tance and municipal courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Illegal possession of firearms being one of the crimes falling by virtue
of section 44 of the Judiciary Act (because of the penalty imposed) within the
jurisdiction of courts of first instance, and likewise falling, under the
authority of section 87(b) (as one of the crimes therein enumerated), with­in
the jurisdiction of municipal courts, there is thus a zone of concurrent
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fallacy in the respondent judge's position is his con­clusion
that decisions of <u>ordinary</u> municipal courts are <span class="SpellE">appeal­able</span>
directly to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court be­cause their
jurisdiction and that of the courts of first instance are concurrent and
therefore similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere concurrence of
juris­diction does not authorize an appeal direct to the Court of Ap­peals or
the Supreme Court from decisions of ordinary munici­pal courts in the absence
of express legislative authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ap­peal
is a purely statutory right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 45
of the Judiciary Act, as amended, explicitly excepts judgments rendered by
munici­pal courts of capitals and city courts exercising like jurisdiction as
courts of first instance pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of section
87(c), as amended, from the scope of the general rule that courts of first
instance have appellate jurisdiction over all cases arising in their respective
provinces.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tracing the history of section 45, we note that the origi­nal
provision of Rep. Act 296 reposed appellate jurisdiction in the courts of first
instance over all cases arising in their respec­tive provinces and tried by municipal
courts (now city courts) and justice of the peace courts (now municipal courts)
regardless of whether these courts exercised exclusive jurisdiction or concur­rent
jurisdiction with courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus section 45 of the Judiciary Act originally read:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellate jurisdiction. - Courts of First Instance shall have
appellate jurisdiction over all cases arising in municipal and justice of the
peace courts in their respective provinces."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Simultaneously with the expansion of the
jurisdiction of municipal courts of capitals and of city courts, and the
requirement of re­cording their proceedings prescribed by the amending act,
Rep. Act 2613, as further amended by Rep. Act 3828, a distinction was drawn in
the matter of appeals from decisions rendered by muni­cipal courts of capitals
and of city courts by the last paragraph of section 87(c) taken together with
section 45 of the Judiciary Act, as amended - this distinction being that their
decisions in cases tried pursuant to the jurisdiction conferred upon them by
the pen­ultimate paragraph of section 87(c) shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
directly to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right of direct appeal to the two
appellate courts was granted with respect only to judgments of municipal courts
of ca­pitals and of city courts but not to those of ordinary municipal courts;
this right of direct appeal, being in the nature of an ex­ception to section 45
of the Judiciary Act, as amended, must be strictly construed and its purview
cannot be extended to embrace decisions of ordinary municipal courts in
concurrent jurisdiction cases but must perforce be limited to what has been
explicitly excepted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our view is buttressed by
section 5 of Rule 123 of the New Rules of Court which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appeal from judgment of the justice of the peace or municipal
court. - The convicted party may appeal either orally or in writing from any fi­nal
judgment of the justice of the peace or munici­pal court in a criminal cause to
the Court of First Instance within fifteen (15) days from the promulga­tion of
the judgment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Absent
the exception provided in section 45 and the last paragraph of section 87(c) of
the Judiciary Act, as amended, the above-cited provision of the New Rules of
Court governs the manner of appeals from decisions of ordinary municipal
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute granting </span>the
right of appeal is the Judiciary Act, as amended, particularly section 45
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Appeal </span>being a purely statutory right, the law granting the
right must be strictly complied with, and the grant cannot be extended by
implication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, since the law does
not grant direct appeal to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court from
decisions of ordinary municipal courts in concurrent crimi­nal jurisdiction
cases, we cannot authorize such mode of appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">An analysis of section 87(c) and section 45 of the Judiciary Act,
as amended, reveals that while the legislature had endowed municipal courts of
capitals and city courts with "like jurisdiction" as a court of <span style="">first </span>instance and a<span style=""> </span>status as such, it withheld the same
from ordinary municipal courts trying concurrent criminal jurisdiction
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court cannot ordain ordinary
municipal courts with the status of courts of first instance, nor classify them
as courts of record by requiring them to record their proceedings, for such
actuation on our part would transcend the periphery of legitimate judicial
function and constitute an encroachment upon legislative prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can we authorize a direct appeal to
the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, in the absence of express statutory
authority, for the practical reason that because ordinary municipal courts are
not required to record their proceedings the appellate courts would have no
record of evidence to consider on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In concurrent criminal jurisdiction cases tried by munici­pal
courts of provincial and sub-provincial capitals and by city courts, the
judgments are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly to the Court of Ap­peals
or the Supreme Court, as the case may be, provided their proceedings have been
recorded<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and a valid exercise of jurisdic­tion has been effected.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Verily, such cases would be appropriate cases within the context of the
doctrine we laid down in <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span>, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following words used in <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span> are clear enough to require further
interpretation: "The pronouncement is made on the assumption that the
proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City Court in which the
petitioner was convicted have been regularly conducted and recorded and the
stenographic notes have been taken of the testimony submitted to the trial
court, for there is nothing in the records before us to show otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, should the evidence not have been
recorded (or transcribed) as required by the last part of section 87(c) of the
Judiciary law, then the trial of the cri­minal case would be an entire nullity,
as held in <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Esten­zo</span>,
et al., G.R. No. L-20971, <span style="">May 19, 1965,
for the </span>reason that the Court of Appeals cannot review the findings of
fact of the trial court if there is no record of the evidence taken during the
trial of the case." The rationale is obviously based on section 87(c) of
Rep. Act 3828 which requires municipal courts of capitals and ci­ty courts to
record their proceedings when trying cases where the penalty does not exceed
imprisonment of more than six years or a fine of not more than six thousand
pesos, or both, and which di­rects appeals in such cases to be brought to the
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"When it was provided in Sec. 87(c) of Rep. Act 296 as amended
by Rep. Act 2613, that the ci­ty courts of chartered cities have like
jurisdiction as the Court of First Instance to try parties charg­ed with an
offense in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
or impri­sonment for not more than six years or fine not ex­ceeding P3000.00 or
both (now P6000.00 or both) the city court thereby acts as a Court of First Ins­tance
and its decisions are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly to the
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the city court tries cases of this
nature and it acts as a Court of First Instance, it must perforce act as a
court of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very law itself
provides that in the exercise of this juris­diction by the municipal courts of
provincial capi­tals and city courts, the proceedings must be re­corded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the decisions of the city court or
of the municipal court of provincial capitals in the exercise of this
jurisdiction are similar to de­cisions of the Court of First Instance, and
their de­cisions cannot be appealed to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme
Court, as the case may be, if there are no records of their proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It thus becomes inescapable that <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span> do not apply to this case before
us, for the following reasons: first, <span class="SpellE"><u>Espe­rat</u></span>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span> dealt with criminal cases tried and
decided by city courts, whereas the present case deals with a criminal case
tried and decided by an ordinary municipal court which is not a munici­pal
court of a provincial or a sub-provincial capital; second, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span><u>
</u>there was concurrence of jurisdiction by rea­son of the penalty imposed on
the crime, whereas in the case at bar, the basis of concurrence in jurisdiction
is the crime itself; third, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span>, proceedings were required by law to be
recorded, whereas here no such requirement exists; fourth, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Esperat</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span>
the law expressly directs appeal to be brought to the Court of Appeals or the
Supreme Court, whereas in this case, the general provision (1st clause of sec.
45 of the Judiciary Act) applies with respect to appeals from decisions of
ordinary municipal courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order of the respondent CFI of February
