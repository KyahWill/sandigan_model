				<H3>GILBERT SEMON, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. HON. PIO E. MARCOS, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BAGUIO CITY AND THE HEIRS OF SIOCO CARIÑO, REPRESENTED BY PAULITA CARIÑO, ADMINISTRATOR, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petition for certiorari filed by Gilbert Semon et al., against the
Honorable Pio R. Marcos, Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance
of Baguio City, and the heirs of Sioco Cariño, for the annulment of an
Order issued by the former denying petitioners' motion for authority to
survey the Jots respectively claimed by each of them and found within
the perimeter of the bigger parcel sought to be registered by the other
respondents.
<p>The registration proceeding above mentioned refers to a parcel of
about 100 hectares, the small lots claimed by each one of herein
petitioners being, as alleged in their petition, "scattered within the
said parcel of land". Petitioners, on January 9 and August 25, 1963,
filed a petition for authority to survey the lots aforesaid but the
same was denied by the respondent judge in the order complained of on
February 8, 1963. It is now alleged that, in doing so, the respondent
judge acted arbitrarily and with grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>The present petition must be, as it is hereby, denied for lack of merit.</p>
<p>In their amended opposition to the application for registration
filed by the heirs of Sioco Cariño, petitioners alleged under oath that
they had been in actual, open, continuous, exclusive, notorious, and
peaceful possession of the lots respectively claimed by each of them.
If this is so, it seems clear that they could make the survey at any
time without asking for leave of court. Should their right to do so be
impeded by force or other unlawful means, petitioners could seek Proper
remedy in the competent court.</p>
<p>Petition dismissed.</p>
<p><i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepción, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, Regala </i>and <i>Makalintal, JJ., concur.</i></p></div>
