				<BR><BR><div align=""><div class="Section1"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Juan <span class="SpellE">Benemrito</span> and Solomon <span class="SpellE">Benemrito</span> 
appeal on questions of law from the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> dismissing their petition for a writ of 
certiorari against respondents <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> <span class="SpellE">Costanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> de <span class="SpellE">Raboy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugbinar</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts are: In Civil Case No. 
15 of the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Badian</span>, 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, for forcible entry, judgment 
was rendered on </span><st1:date month="2" day="5" year="1951"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 5, 
1951</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
favor of plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Petronila</span> <span class="SpellE">Costanilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> de <span class="SpellE">Raboy</span>. The judgment ordered defendants Juan <span class="SpellE">Benemrito</span> and Solomon <span class="SpellE">Benemrito</span> to 
vacate the land in litigation and to pay monthly rents until the return of 
possession, plus damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defendants appealed to the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>. They filed a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond to stay execution and regularly paid the 
adjudged monthly rents. Pending appeal the parties entered into an amicable 
settlement, so on </span><st1:date month="7" day="20" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 20, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> they 
filed a joint motion asking the court "to have the appeal of the above-entitled 
case dismissed." On the same day the court issued an order dismissing the appeal 
and directing that the case be returned to the Justice of the Peace Court of 
<span class="SpellE">Badian</span> for the execution of its 
judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Having received the case, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugbinar</span>, the Justice of 
the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> (and now one of the 
respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>), on </span><st1:date month="12" day="13" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 13, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
issued a writ of execution of the judgment, but when the sheriff tried to 
enforce the writ the defendants refused to leave the premises. Instead on 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="2" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 2, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
they filed a motion to quash the writ, alleging that the court's judgment could 
not be executed since the same had been <span class="SpellE">novated</span> by the 
amicable settlement, whereby it was agreed that the defendants would continue in 
possession of the land until the question of ownership could be litigated and 
decided. , On </span><st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1957"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 16, 
1957</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
court denied the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Consequently, the defendants in 
that action filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, seeking the annulment of the writ <span class="GramE">of</span> execution issued by the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Badian</span> and the order denying their motion to quash. After 
trial the writ prayed for was denied, hence this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The only question to be resolved 
is whether respondent Justice of the Peace acted without or in excess of 
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the two orders 
complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The effect of the dismissal of 
the appeal in the Court of First Instance, pursuant to the "joint motion of the 
parties, was to revive the judgment appealed from (Section 9, Rule 48, Revised 
Rules of Court). It was as though no appeal had been duly perfected, and 
therefore execution should issue as a matter of right (Section I, Rule 39, <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Rules of Court). It was evidently in accordance with 
this Rule that the Court of First Instance directed the return of the case to 
the Justice of the Peace Court and ordered expressly the "execution of the 
judgment." Upon the foregoing facts respondent court neither acted without or in 
excess of its jurisdiction nor abused its discretion. Indeed it had no 
discretion at all which it could exercise. Compliance with the order of the 
Court of First Instance was a ministerial duty, which it could not shirk by 
denying execution or quashing it afterwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners' position is that in 
the amicable settlement entered into by the parties in the forcible entry case 
and by reason of which they jointly moved for the dismissal of the appeal 
therein it was agreed that they (petitioners) would remain in possession of the 
litigated property. This is denied by private respondents, who claim that it is 
they who were to be in possession, and they have been sustained in the decision 
subject of this appeal. But this point is of no decisive importance or after the 
Court of First Instance dismissed the appeal in the forcible entry case and 
returned it to the court of origin for execution of the judgment, petitioners' 
remedy was to have the order of dismissal reconsidered and modified so that it 
would reflect the true agreement. <span class="GramE">This petitioners</span> 
failed to do, and the order became final. What would amount to a modification 
thereof could certainly not be obtained from the Justice of the Peace Court, 
whose only possible course of action was to issue, as it did, a writ of <span class="GramE">execution.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The judgment appealed from is 
affirmed, with costs against appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
