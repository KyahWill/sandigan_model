				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition filed by <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Peh</span> for the review of the decision and resolution of the
Court of Tax Appeals dated April 29 and December 23, 1961, respectively, in
C.T.A. Case No. 538, ordering him to pay deficiency percentage taxes in the
total amount of P51,939.27.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts are not disputed:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, during all the time material to this case, was
engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling rubber shoes and allied
products in the city of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, under the re­gistered
firm name Victory Rubber Manufacturing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in the year 1955 the Bureau of Internal Revenue
unearthed anomalies committed in the office of the Treasurer of the city of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in connection with the payment of taxes by some
taxpayers, amongst them petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a result the respondent assessed against, and demanded from
petitioner the payment of the following sums:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P4<span class="GramE">,725</span>, in­cluding P100 as penalty, P29,980,
including P50 as penalty, and P17,425 including P50 as penalty, on January 27,
1956, November 12, 1955 and November 12, 1955, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assessment was based upon short payments
in connection with taxes due from petitioner during the periods covered by the
assessment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigation of the
anomalies disclosed that the amounts of the taxes allegedly paid by him, as
appear­ing in the original of every official receipt he had in his possession,
were bigger than the amounts appearing in the corresponding duplicate,
triplicate and quadruplicate copy thereof kept in the office of the City
Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such discrepancies are hereunder tabulated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Official<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appearing

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention below and here is this: since the checks
issued by him covered in full the amount due for each quarter, and were
accepted and deposited by the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>;
since the originals of the official receipts issued by the latter show that the
full amount of the taxes due from him had been paid, he must be deemed to have
paid such taxes <u>in</u> <u>full</u>, and any anomaly in the application of
the amounts paid by him consisting in the diversion of part thereof to pay the
taxes of other taxpayers - whether attributable solely to employees in the
office of said Treasurer or to other parties - should not be held against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's contention, on the other hand, is that the amounts <u>actually</u>
paid by petitioner were those appearing on the duplicates, triplicates and
quadruplicates of the official receipts mentioned heretofore; that the
originals thereof were falsified or altered to make them show payment in full
of the taxes due from petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the issues thus joined petitioner tried to
prove that the payments in question were made by him personally, while, on the
other hand, respondent claimed that said payments were made not by petitioner
personally but by Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>, his authorized
agent in the matter of payment of his taxes; that <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, Chief of the Internal Revenue Division of the
City Treasurer's Office of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, had allowed the
wrongful practice of permitting Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> to
prepare the official receipts in connection with tax payments made by him in
behalf of his merchant clients; that it was Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>
who applied a portion of the amounts given to him by petitioner to pay tax obli­gations
of other taxpayers, also his clients, and that there­fore petitioner's recourse
is against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether it was petitioner, in person, who made the pay­ment of
his taxes herein involved, or it was his aforesaid agent, is manifestly a
question of fact squarely resolved by the Court of Tax Appeals as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner sought to prove that he never em­ployed Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> as a business agent in the payment of the tax in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preponderance of the
evidence shows otherwise. If as alleged, petitioner paid the tax personally,
why were the official receipts prepared by Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>
and not by <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
or any authorized employee in the office of the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>? It appears that Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>
prepared the official receipts of payments of taxpayers who employed him as
business agent. It has not been shown that Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>
prepared any official receipt cover­ing payment of taxpayers other than those
who em­ployed him business agent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After ruling against petitioner on this question, the Court of
Tax Appeals said further:</p>

<blockquote>"Even assuming that Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> was
not employed by petitioner as business agent, peti­tioner is not entirely
blameless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the
payments were made by checks. The numbers of the official receipts covering the
payments are indicated on the back of the checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the checks had been deposited and the
amounts credited in favor of the Government, the cancelled checks were returned
to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is, therefore,
charged with knowledge of the fact that the amount covered by each check was
applied in payment not only of his tax but also of taxes of other taxpayers,
the numbers of the official receipts covering which are indicated on the back
of the check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he accept­ed
the cancelled checks without protest is evidence of his acquiescence to the
manner in which the amount covered by each check was applied by the collecting
officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot now be heard to com­plain."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We can hardly add any other consideration to strengthen the lower
court's ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another question of fact vital to this case is whether or not the
official receipts in petitioner's possession were falsified, and if so by whom.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe it
established as a fact that petitioner had employed Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> as a business agent in the matter of payment of his
taxes. The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, Isidro <span class="SpellE">Badana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span> on this matter (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>. pp. 200-201, 472-473, 483-484, 501-503, 508­-510,
525, 535-539) were corroborated by the statement and report of NBI handwriting
expert Felipe Logan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>, as such petitioner's agent, actually paid to the
government less than the amounts of the taxes due from petitioner is also fully
proven by their testimonies and the duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate
copies of the official receipts which appear upon their face to be genuine or
authentic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same thing can not be
claimed for the official receipts in question, because the lower court found
that, as in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Bon Sin vs. Collector
etc., C.T.A. No. 286, and Yap <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
vs. Arenas, C.T.A. No. 533, appellant employed the same business agent who
misappropriated a portion of the amounts entrusted to him and paid less than
what was due from his principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
plain words, the lower court expressed the view that the official receipts in
peti­tioner's hands did not reflect the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's ruling upon these questions must be sustained
pursuant to our consistent ruling to the effect that in reviews of the nature
of the present, only errors of law are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by
this Court (G. R. L-12174 Maria B. Castro vs. Collector, April 26, 1962; G. R.
L-9738 <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Gutierrez, et al. vs. Court of Tax
Appeals; G. R. L-8556 Benito Sanchez vs. Commissioner of Customs, Sept. 30,
1957 and 54 O.G. No. 2, p. 361; <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Perez vs.

Collector, <st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1961</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing disposes of the first two assignments of error
submitted in petitioner's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
third, it is his contention that the Court a quo erred in holding that he is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the misapplication of his pay­ments.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is only a corollary of the questions raised in the previous
assignments of error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as We
have held in resolving the latter that, in point of fact, Tan Chuan <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> was petitioner's agent, the conclusion must
necessarily be that the, agent's acts bind his principal; without prejudice, of
course, to the latter seeking recourse against him in an appropriate civil or
criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth and last assignment of error has been impliedly
resolved adversely to petitioner in our rulings upon the first three.</p>

affirmed, with costs.</p>
