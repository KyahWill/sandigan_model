on July 19, 1971 but the latter refused and failed to render such accounting
although it was her duty, under the law, to turn over the excess of the
proceeds of the sale to the mortgagors considering that the mortgaged property
was sold for P69,568.50 while the loan secured was only P50,000.00 thereby

<p class="BODY">Because of complainant's assertion that the sum of P12,500.00
awarded as attorney's fees was "staggering" and that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ona</span> "arbitrarily" fixed said attorney's fees the
court resolved to refer the matter to Executive Judge Alberto <span class="SpellE">Ubay</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,

<blockquote>"Having thus completely lost her fight against Ruben C. Alonzo
and Salvador J. <span class="SpellE">Monroy</span> for the recovery of her
property which was the subject of the litigation in Civil Case No. C-2573 above
indicated, complainant Rosalina B. <span class="SpellE">Basa</span> now turned
her guns against the <st1:place><st1:placename>Ex-officio</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Sheriff, Atty. Emma C. <span class="SpellE">Ona</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that complainant' s counsel wrote
a letter addressed to Deputy Sheriff Mariano who, in his reply dated January 9,
1975 (p. 22, Records) stated that 'the auction sale of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Basa's</span>
real estate was <u>not</u> conducted by the undersigned <u>nor sold</u> in
connection <span class="SpellE">withthe</span> above-captioned case' (Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Basa</span>, et al. vs. Ruben C. Alonzo, et al., CFI of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Branch XXXII).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this portion of the letter of Deputy
Sheriff Mariano, it is evident that complainant's counsel is of the <u>wrong
impression</u>, as will be explained later, that the auction sale of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Basa's</span> real estate was conducted in connection with, or
pursuant to, the decision in said civil case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As further clearly stated by Deputy Sheriff Mariano, in his
aforementioned letter to complainant's counsel, 'the action taken in connection
thereto on <u>my part</u> was to comply with the Order from the Honorable Court
<u>to take possession</u> of the subject premises and <u>deliver the same</u>
to the defendants, Ruben Alonzo, et al. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That such indeed is the impression of counsel of complainant
is further shown by the fact that their letter addressed to respondent Atty.
Emma C. <span class="SpellE">Ona</span> dated January 27, 1975, is captioned
'Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Basa</span> vs. Ruben Alonzo, et al., <u>Civil
Case No. C-2573</u>, CFI of <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Br.</st1:country-region></st1:place> 32.' In that letter
(p. 12, Records) in which counsel for complainant threatened to 'prosecute what
we have hereinabove intimated' if within three (3) days they fail to hear from
her, it was stated:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'As already stated in the said letter, your office caused the
auction sale of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Basa's</span> real estate of which the
highest bid as per your certificate of sale was P69,568.50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the principal loan was only for
P50,000.00 and although the parties concerned in an amicable settlement which
served as the basis of the decision, the redemption amount was to be
P54,000.00, our client was never favored with a reply as to the disposition of
the purchase price, much less, did she receive the difference, as there must
be, between her obligation and the bid as provided for by law.'</p>

<blockquote>"Thus, it is clear that counsel for complainant is of the
impression that the auction sale of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Basa's</span> real
estate of which the highest bid was P69,568.50 was made pursuant to 'the
decision which was based on an amicable settlement, with the redemption amount
fixed at P54,000.00, although the principal loan was only P50,000.00.' Thus,
complainant's counsel contended that since the highest bid was P69,568.50,
there must be a difference between the 'obligation and the bid as provided by
law', and so the difference between the purchase price and the legal obligation
of complainant should be turned over to the mortgagors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Complainant's counsel also <u>questioned the authority of
respondent to fix the attorney's fees in the subject extrajudicial foreclosure,
alleging that 'the same is not expressly stipulated in the contract</u>', and
that such prerogative belongs to the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may also be noted that of the accounting rendered by
respondent in which the proceeds of the auction sale in the amount of
P69,568.50 was itemized, <u>the only item questioned by complainant's counsel</u>
was the sum of P12,500.00 awarded or set aside for attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The question, therefore, to determine in the instant
administrative matter is whether or not respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ona</span>,
in her capacity as Ex-Officio Sheriff, had arbitrarily fixed the amount of P12,000.00
as attorney's fees for lack of legal basis in so doing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is evident that prior to the filing of the
letter-administrative complaint which is the subject of this investigation, and
subsequent letter-complaints above-indicated, neither complainant nor her
counsel have read the Real Estate Mortgage in question (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"1", p. 108, Records) which was quoted in full above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if they have read or have taken the
trouble of reading its provisions, they would have known from the start that
the said 'Real Estate Mortgage' executed by complainant Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Basa</span> herself on June 1, 1970, provides in its fourth
paragraph thereof '<u>that in case of foreclosure, said mortgagees may proceed
thereto judicially or <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> in accordance
with Act 3135, as amended, for the satisfaction of all my obligations,
including attorney's fees in the sum equivalent of 25% of the obligation, plus
all other expenses incidental to foreclosure proceedings</u>.' This is the
legal authority or legal basis for respondent or her deputy sheriff, Alejandro
Reyes, to have awarded the amount of P12,500.00 as attorney's fees, this amount
being equivalent to 25% of the obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Considering that a contract is the law between the parties, there can,
therefore, be no question that the amount of P12,500.00 set aside or awarded as
attorney's fees by respondent pursuant to the said Real Estate Mortgage
Contract, is the legal basis of the action taken by respondent and her

<blockquote>"Furthermore, as indicated above, herein complainant, as one
of the plaintiffs who entered into an amicable settlement in Civil Case No.
C-2573, wherein they settled only for the right granted to them to redeem the
property in question in the amount of P54,000.00 within the period of six (6)
months from January 4, 1973, with interest at 1% per month, complainant has
impliedly <u>waived</u> or <u>abandoned</u> her right to question the legality
or propriety of the auction sale during the extrajudicial proceedings held on
July 19, 1971, in which, among others, the sum of P12,500.00 equivalent to 25%
of her obligation, was awarded as attorney's fees in accordance with the
express provisions of the Real Estate Mortgage Contract in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that complainant failed or was
unable to redeem her property under the terms of the Compromise Agreement
should not justify her in again reviving her previous contention that the award
of P12,500.00 as attorney's fees was illegal or unconscionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant alone should suffer the effects
of her previous actuations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
herein acted within the limits of the law in the performance of her duty as
Ex-Officio City Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding nothing illegal nor corrupt in the actuations of
respondent, the Honorable Investigating Judge recommends the dismissal of the
instant administrative complaint and the exoneration of respondent of all
charges against her.</p>

Investigating Judge.</p>
