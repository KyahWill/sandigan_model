<p class="BODY">After due hearing the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1967</st1:date>, rendered a decision dis­missing the petition for <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> held that <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> @ <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Ming <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> was validly

in the exercise of his pre­rogatives pursuant to the provisions of Section 64(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) of the Revised Administrative Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals from the decision of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the decision of a special division of five
justices, with three justices concurring, and two justices concurring and
dissenting, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision which in effect affirmed
the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
dismissing <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio's</span> petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">We read the following in the majority opinion:</p>

<blockquote>"It having been settled that Sec­tion 64(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)
of the Revised Administrative Code is still in force, and that the respondent
Executive Secretary, in the name and by authority of the President, exercised
the power of recommitment here­in under the provisions of said Code, and not
under Art. 159 of the Revised Penal Code, it becomes apparent that any
discussion regarding failure to file the corresponding indictment and the
presence or absence of criminal intent, will be off-tangent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the issue, in this
connection, is whether the courts of justice may interfere in the exercise by
the President, thru his Executive Sec­retary, of his administrative power of
recommitment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it is settled
jurisprudence that the Chief Executive may determine, alone and by himself,
whether the condition attached to a pardon given by him has been violated; and
in the exer­cise of this prerogative, the courts may not interfere, however
erroneous the find­ings may be (<span class="SpellE">Espuelas</span> v. The
Provincial Warden, supra; <span class="SpellE">Tesoro</span> v. Director of
Prisons, 68 Phil. 154)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portion of the majority
opinion affirms the reasons of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in dismissing the petition for <u>habeas</u><i> </i><u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the majority opinion contains the
recommenda­tion that <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kio</span></p>

<blockquote>".... be sent out at once from this country and that he be
allowed to leave <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> Prisons under guard only
when he has been booked for outward flight at the Manila International Airport
so as to avoid the possibility of any further viola­tion of his conditional
pardon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate it would be to the
best interest of the security and peace of this country to have the petitioner
expatriated from the Philippines, instead of being recommitted for a long
duration of time to prison where his presence may constitute a constant menace
to our country's welfare and bring about some sinister influence among the
people with whom he will associate or come in contact."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
majority opinion reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL OF THE FOREGOING REASONS, the petition herein filed
is hereby dismissed, with costs against the peti­tioner, and with a reiteration
of the recommendation to allow the petitioner to leave this country in the
first available transportation abroad made in the course of this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this decision be furnished the
Executive Secretary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The concurring and dissenting opinion of the two justices opens
with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>"We concur with the majority opinion insofar as the dismissal
of the petition for writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> of petitioner-appellant
<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span>
is concerned, for such dismissal, in effect, is equivalent to an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the appealed decision. However, we beg to
dissent from that por­tion of the majority opinion recommending that said
petitioner-appellant be allowed to leave this country by the first avail­able
transportation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due time the Solicitor General filed with the Court of Appeals
a motion for reconsideration, praying for the deletion from the majority
opinion of the recom­mendation to allow <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> to leave the country on
the first available transportation abroad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals, by a vote of three to two in the special division
which decided the case, denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence this appeal by certiorari by the Solicitor General to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now contended by the Solicitor General that the majority of
the special division of five justices of the Court of Appeals erred in making a
recommendation to allow respondent <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> to leave this country on
the first available transportation abroad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Soli­citor General maintains that the recommendation is not a part
of the decision binding upon the parties, and is uncalled for; that it gives
the decision a political complexion, because courts are not empowered to make
such a recommendation, nor is it inherent or incidental in the exercise of
judicial powers; that there is no law which gives the court the authority to
recommend to the President the voluntary departure of an undesirable alien who
is lawfully committed to jail; that the deporta­tion of aliens sentenced by the
courts for violation of the laws of the land, and even the act of merely
allowing such convicted aliens to voluntarily leave the country, is an act of
state exercised solely in the discretion of the Chief Executive. It is urged by
the Solicitor General that the act of sending an undesirable alien out of the
country is political in character, and the courts should not interfere with,
nor attempt to influence, the political acts of the Chief Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated <st1:date year="1969" day="7" month="4">April
 7, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kio</span> manifested that he waived his right to file an
answer to any brief filed by the Solicitor General.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case before the Court of Appeals was for <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question to be
resolved by the Court of Ap­peals was whether, or not, the Court of First
Instate of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, had rightly dismissed the petition
of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals was not called upon to
review any sentence imposed upon <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sentence against him had long become
final, and, in fact, he had served part of the sentence when he was extended
pardon on <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1959</st1:date>, upon
the condition that he should leave the country, never to return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of the three justices of the
special division of the Court of Appeals, to which the two other justices have
concurred, found that the recommitment to prison of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> was done in the
exercise by the President of the Philippines of his power pursuant to the
provision of Section 64(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) of the Revised Adminis­trative
Code, and the courts should not interfere with the exercise of that power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority opinion should have been limited
to the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the de­cision of the lower
court, and no more.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recommendatory power of the courts in this jurisdiction are
limited to those expressly provided in the law - and such law is the provision
of Section 5 of the Revised Penal Code, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Whenever a court has knowledge of any act which it may deem
proper to repress and which is not punishable by law, it shall render the
proper decision, and shall report to the Chief Executive, through the Department
of Justice, the reasons which induce the court to believe that said act should
be made the subject of penal legislation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the same way the court shall submit to the Chief
Executive, through the Department of Justice such statement as may be deemed
proper, without suspending the execution of the sentence, when a strict
enforcement of the provisions of this Code would result in the imposition of a
clearly excessive penalty, taking into consideration the degree of malice and
the injury caused by the offense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the recommendation in the majority opinion of the
special division of the Court of Appeals, now in question, is not authorized
under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of Article 5 of the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
was not called upon to review any sentence that was imposed on <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was simply called upon to determine
whether <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> was illegal­ly confined, or not, in the insular
penitentiary under the Director of Prisons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not consider it proper that the majority of the justices in the
special division make a recommendation that would suggest a modification or a
correction of the act of the Chief Executive, after the same justices have said
in their opinion "that the Chief Executive may determine, alone and by
himself, whether the condition attached to a pardon given by him had been
violated; and in the exercise of this prero­gative, the courts may not
interfere, however erroneous the findings may be."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Chief Executive, exer­cising his
powers pursuant to Section 64(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) of the Re­vised
Administrative Code, ordered <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kio</span> recommit­ted to prison, it is assumed that the
Chief Executive had decided that <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span> should be dealt with that
way under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
court to suggest to the Chief Executive to modify his decision to recom­mit <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> <span class="SpellE">Kio</span>
to prison by allowing him to leave the country instead is indeed to interfere
with the functions of the Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be, as urged by the Solicitor General, an interference on, or
an attempt to influence, the exercise by the Chief Executive of the political
powers of his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter of
whether an alien who violated the laws in this country may remain or be
deported is a political question that should be left entirely to the Chief
Executive to de­cide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
principle of separation of powers, it is not within the province of the
judiciary to express an opinion, or express a suggestion, that would reflect on
the wisdom or propriety of the action of the Chief Executive on matters purely
political in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be said that the recommendation embodied in the majority
opinion of the special division of the Court of Appeals simply represents the
private opinion of the three justices, and judges should be left free to express
even their private opinions in judicial decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe, however, that the better practice
should be that the decision of a court should contain only opinion that is
relevant to the question that is before the court for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, courts are not concerned with the
wisdom or mora­lity of laws, but only in the interpretation and appli­cation of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that judges should
refrain from expressing irrelevant opinions in their decisions which may only
reflect unfavorably upon their competence and the propriety of their judicial

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO,<i> J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The opinion of the Court penned by Justice Zaldivar, both
thorough and meticulous, is, to my mind, equally noteworthy for expressing with
clarity and precision the governing principle that should govern the discharge
of judicial functions.  It has my full
concurrence therefore.  I would like,
however, to add a few words to the subject in view of the significance attached
to a matter so fundamental in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic premise, of course, is the decisive weight to be
accorded the fundamental postulate of separation of powers.  While the failure of the majority opinion of
the respondent Court of Appeals to yield full obeisance to its implications
insofar as the executive is concerned is brought to light in the opinion of
Justice Zaldivar, I would on my part view it further as an unwarranted
assumption by the judiciary of a role which under the Constitution is denied
it.  To be more precise, it is not for
any occupant of any court to play the role of adviser to the Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">I entertain serious fears that if the rule were otherwise not
only would there be an infringement of the separation of powers concept but the
delicate and grave duty of the courts to assure compliance with constitutional
mandates and maintain its supremacy as called for by the rule of law would be
gravely endangered.  Such a point of
view I once had occasion to manifest in a concurring opinion.  Thus:   "For to go back to the concept of the rule of law, in the
same way that the legislative and the executive branches are required to act
strictly within the bounds of their competence, the judiciary, including this
Court, is likewise restricted to its proper domain.  The fact that on questions of law it has the final say makes it
all the more imperative that in passing upon the question of whether or not it
is called upon to act, it takes the utmost care that in assuring compliance
with constitutional limitations, it does not, at the same time, ignore the
limits of its own authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">What was said by Justice Malcolm, speaking for this Court in a
1932 opinion, comes to mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Time has not impaired its validity; it has but served to confirm it. Thus:   "The Supreme Court of the Philippine
Islands represents one of the three divisions of power in our government. It is
judicial power and judicial power only which is exercised by the Supreme
Court.  Just as the Supreme Court, as
the guardian of constitutional rights, should not sanction usurpations by any
other department of the government, so should it as strictly confine its own
sphere of influence to the powers expressly or by implication conferred on it
by the Organic Act.  The Supreme Court
and its members should not and cannot be required to exercise any power or to
perform any trust or to assume any duty not pertaining to or connected with the
administering of judicial functions."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the above view, Justice Malcolm made reference to
the last opinion of Chief Justice Taney of the United States Supreme
Court.  This is the excerpt referred to:
  "Its jurisdiction and powers and
duties being defined in the organic law of the government, and being all strictly
judicial, Congress cannot require or authorize the court to exercise any other
jurisdiction or power, or perform any other duty. * * *  And while it executes firmly all the
judicial powers entrusted to it, the court will carefully abstain from
exercising any power that is not strictly judicial in its character, and which
is not clearly confided to it by the Constitution. * * * "<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is likewise the epochal opinion of Justice Cardozo, as
Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
when that Court nullified a section of a New York statute that would vest in a
justice of its Supreme Court the power to investigate at the instance of its
governor.  His opinion explained why:   "He is made the delegate of the Governor
in aid of an executive act, the removal of a public officer. * * *  At the word of command he is to give over
the work of judging, and set himself to other work, the work of probing and
advising.  His findings when made will
have none of the authority of a judgment.  To borrow Bacon's phrase, they will not 'give the rule or
sentence.'  They will not be preliminary
or ancillary to any rule or sentence to be pronounced by the judiciary in any
of its branches.  They will be mere
advice to the Governor, who may adopt them, or modify them, or reject them
altogether.  From the beginnings of our
history, the principle has been enforced that there is no inherent power in
Executive or Legislature to charge the judiciary with administrative functions
except when reasonably incidental to the fulfillment of judicial duties. * *
*  The exigencies of government have
made it necessary to relax a merely doctrinaire adherence to a principle so
flexible and practical, so largely a matter of sensible approximation, as that
of the separation of powers.  'Elasticity has' not meant that what is of the essence of the judicial
function may be destroyed by turning the power to decide into a pallid
opportunity to consult and recommend * * *. "</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a principle in American law, Justice Cardozo could trace
back to Hayburn's Case,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1792 decision.  He made mention of
another authoritative precedent, this too coming from the pen of Chief Justice
Taney in 1851, in United States v. Ferreira.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>  A provision of the Treaty of 1819 by virtue
of which Florida was ceded by Spain to the United States was to the effect that
it was incumbent on the latter to satisfy claims for injury by Spaniards
whether in the armed forces or civilians due to the operations of the American
army in Florida.  In 1823 Congress
passed an act to carry into execution this article of the Treaty.  It was therein authorized for the judges of
the superior courts established at St. Augustine and Pensacola, Florida,
respectively, to receive and adjust all claims arising within their respective
jurisdictions, agreeably to the above article of the Treaty.  Decisions favorable to claimants were to be
reported by such judges to the Secretary of the Treasury, "who, on being
satisfied that the same is just and equitable, within the provisions of the
Treaty, shall pay the amount thereof to the person or persons in whose favor
the said is adjudged."</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Chief Justice Taney:   "It is too evident for argument on the subject, that such a
tribunal is not a judicial one, and that the Act of Congress did not intend to
make it one.  The authority conferred on
the respective judges was nothing more than that of a commissioner to adjust
certain claims against the United States; and the office of judges, and their
respective jurisdiction, are referred to in the law, merely as a designation of
the persons to whom the authority is confided, and the territorial limits to
which it extends.  The decision is not
the judgment of a court of justice. It is the award of a commissioner.  The Act of 1834 calls it an award.  And an appeal to this court from such a
decision, by such an authority from the judgment of a court of record, would be
an anomaly in the history of jurisprudence."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor was this the first time in the New York bench that Justice
Cardozo, speaking for the Court, made such a pronouncement.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>  In holding not legally allowable the
reference to the New York Court of Appeals by the Industrial Commission of New
York, the question of whether or not it was authorized to require payment into
the state fund of certain unpaid death benefits, the distinguished jurist
declared:   "In that situation our
duty is not doubtful.  The function of
the courts is to determine controversies between litigants. * * * They do not
give advisory opinions.  The giving of
such opinions is not the exercise of the judicial function. * * * It is true
that in England the custom of the Constitution makes the judges of the high
court the assistants of the Lords, and requires them, upon the demand of the
Lords, to give 'consultative' opinions.  But that custom is a survival of the days when the judges were members
of the great council of the realm.  In
the United States no such duty attaches to the judicial office in the absence
of express provision of the Constitution."</p>

<p class="BODY">There could be no disputing the accuracy of the observation made
by Justice Cardozo in the Richardson opinion as to the fatal infirmity that
would infect the role of a judge as a counselor of the Executive in these
words:   "Centuries of common law
tradition warn us with echoing impressiveness that this is not a judge's
work."  In that sense we are as one
with the common-law although we cannot trace it that far back.  Failure to adhere to it gives rise to a
grave concern.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, I would assume that those of us entrusted with judicial
responsibility could not be unaware that we may be laying ourselves open to the
charge of presumptuousness.  Considering
that the exercise of judicial authority does not embrace the alien role of a
presidential adviser, an indictment of officiousness may be hard to repel.  It is infinitely worse if the advice thus
gratuitously offered is ignored or disregarded.  The loss of judicial prestige may be incalculable.  Thereafter, there may be less than full
respect for court decisions.  It would
impair the confidence in its ability to live up to its trust not only on the
part of immediate parties to the litigation but of the general public as
well.  Even if the teaching of decided
cases both here and in the Philippines is not as clear therefore, there should
be, to say the least, the utmost reluctance on the part of any court to
arrogate for itself such a prerogative, the exercise of which is fraught with
possibilities of such undesirable character.</p>

<p class="BODY">When it is borne in mind that no undue attention need be paid to
such advice, which may prove to be ineffectual, even futile, with consequences
far-from-flattering to the judiciary, the language of the then Professor
Frankfurter used with reference to advisory opinions, although set in a
different context, would not be inappropriate.  They are "ghosts that slay."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>  There is no place for them in the law, not
if respect be paid to a coordinate branch, the Executive, and if, to my mind a
more important consideration, there be no deviation from what thus far has
rightly been conceived to be the fitting and proper role of the judiciary.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MAKALINTAL, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent from the opinion of my brethren insofar as it orders
the deletion of the recommendation of three of the five Justices who
constituted the special division of the Court of Appeals which decided this
case that the petitioner Ang Cho Kio be allowed "to leave this country by
the first available transportation." This recommenda­tion is admittedly
not a part of the judgment of the said Court; it was not within the issue
presented for its re­solution; and the fact that it was made at all is a
non-prejudicial matter which does not rise to the category of reversible error.  I would not begrudge the three Jus­tices who
made it the liberty to do so, nor consider their act as an undue trespass upon
presidential prerogative.  What is
involved is, to me, no more than a question of taste, or punctilious observance
of certain proprieties concerning which well-meaning men may honestly differ;
and I am not prepared to say that there has been such a blatant disregard of
either as to call for the interposi­tion of this Court's power of review merely
for the purpose of ordering the deletion of the matter objected to.</p>
