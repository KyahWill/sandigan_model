				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The corrective powers of this Court are invoked in this, an
original petition for certiorari, to strike down the reopening pro­ceedings
before the cadastral court below upon the jurisdictional ground of lack of
publication, or, in the alternative, to annul said court's orders rejecting
petitioner's intervention for want of per­sonality to sue.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The litigation below commenced from the petition of respondent <span class="SpellE">Rufito</span> <span class="SpellE">Akia</span> before the Court of<span style=""> </span>First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, acting as a cadastral court, for the reopening of cadastral proceedings,
pursuant to Republic Act 931.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Aida there sought the registration in his name of 15,922 square
meters of land situated in the City <span style="">of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner Virginia L. de Castro moved to intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her interest is in the 1,000 square meters
allegedly included in the 15,922 square meters of land specified in respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia's</span> petition below.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that petitioner Virginia de Castro filed with the
Bureau of Lands Township Sales Application [<span style="">TSA-V-3559 (E-V-­</span>405)] covering a 1,000 square meter-parcel of
land identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Hill Subdivision, Residential Section "K", <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was surveyed for which she paid a fee of
P150.00 on <st1:date year="1955" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public auction, duly published, was conducted
at which petitioner de Castro was the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="12" day="17" year="1955">December
 17, 1955</st1:date>, the lot was awarded in her favor at a cost of P4.30 per
square meter, or a total of <span style="">P4,</span>300.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner fully paid the purchase price
which, with interests, amounted to P4,306.38.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, it is claimed, had been paying taxes on the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner's motion for intervention, despite <span class="SpellE">Akia's</span>
opposition, was granted by the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial on the merits, petitioner de Castro, respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia</span>, and different government agencies were duly
represented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner de Castro there
presented documentary and testimonial evidence in support of her opposition to
the inclusion of said 1,000 square meters of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Akia</span> lodged a motion to dismiss
petitioner's opposition to his (<span class="SpellE">Akia's</span>) petition to
reopen the cadastral proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ground
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, amongst others, was that petitioner lacked
personality to sue.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1965</st1:date>,
over the objection of herein petitioner de Castro, respondent judge ruled out
her intervention and dismissed her opposition to the reopening of the cadastral
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that mere
applicants of public land have no capacity to sue independently of the Bureau
of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge <u>did</u> <u>not</u>
<u>go</u> into the merits of the case upon the evidence presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, on <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1966</st1:date>,
de Castro moved to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
stressed the fact that she was not a mere applicant of public land but an
equitable owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, she
was an <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> who had paid to the government, in
full, the sales value of the land she applied for.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent judge refused reconsideration, this time upon a different
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge based his action on a
"Manifestation" of counsel for the Director of Lands of <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1966</st1:date> stating that on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1965</st1:date>, the Director of
Lands had cancelled the award in favor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">A second motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1966</st1:date> was registered by petitioner de
Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She there informed the court
that, thru a letter of <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="12">December 3,
 1965</st1:date>, she had urged from the Director of Lands reconsideration of
the revocation of the award in her favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She appended to her motion the foregoing letter where she made it clear
that construction of her residential house on the lot as required was an
impossibility because, in the year 1955 and several years thereafter, there
were no lighting, water and road facilities within the immediate vicinity of
the land, and later on, the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
refused to issue the required building permit because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia's</span>
petition for reopening heretofore adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also acquainted the Court with the fact that because of her letter
aforesaid, the Director of Lands had asked its <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> office to reexamine the
revocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the land in
question, so she continued to aver in her motion, could not be the subject of a
petition for judicial reopening as it was never in possession of respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1966</st1:date>,
the foregoing second motion for reconsideration was perfunctorily denied by
respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on March 15, 1966, the Director of Lands came out with an
order reinstating petitioner de Castro's award, for the reason that lack of
water and lighting facilities found to be true in the investigation conducted
by the Bureau of Lands caused delay in the construction of petitioner's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director, however, held in
abeyance further action thereon until respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia's</span>
petition for reopening is finally decided by the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next move of petitioner Virginia L. de Castro was to start
certiorari proceedings in this Court thru a verified petition praying that the
orders of respondent judge, dismissing her opposition to the reopening, be set
aside and annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the return of respondents, and the memoranda of the parties,
the case is now before us for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. First to merit attention is the question of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of petitioner's argument is that the reopening of the
cadastral case below is jurisdictionally tainted by lack of publi­cation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia's</span> petition for
reopening was instituted under Republic Act 931, effective <st1:date year="1953" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1953</st1:date>, which in its Section 1 reads:</p>

<blockquote>“SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All persons claiming
title to parcels of land that have been the object of cadastral proceedings,
who at the time of the survey were in <u>actual</u> <u>possession</u> of the
same, but for some justifiable reason had been unable <span style="">to </span>file their claim in the proper court during the time limit
established by law, in case such parcels of land, on account of their failure
to file such claims, have been, or are about to be declared land of the public
domain, by virtue of judicial proceedings instituted within the forty years
next preceding the approval of this Act, are hereby granted the right within
five years<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
after the date on which this Act shall take effect, to petition for a reopening
of the judicial proceedings under the provisions of Act Numbered Twenty-two
hundred and fifty-nine, as amended, <u>only</u> <u>with respect</u> to such of
said parcels of land as have <u>not</u> been alienated, reserved, leased,
granted, or <u>otherwise</u> <u>pro</u><u><span style="">visionally</span></u><span style=""> </span>or <u>permanently</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">disposed</span></u>
of by the Government, and the competent Court of First Instance, upon receiving
such petition, shall notify the Government, <u>through</u> the Solicitor
General, and if after hearing the parties, said court shall find that all
conditions herein established have been complied with, and that all taxes,
interests and penalties thereof have been paid from the time when land tax
should have been collected until the day when the motion is presented, it shall
order said judicial proceedings reopened as if no action has been taken <span style="">on </span>such parcels."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing provision establishes the procedure for reopening
cadastral proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such procedure
does not include publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is
publication mentioned in any of the other provisions of Republic Act 931.
Section 1 above-quoted merely states that "the competent Court of First
Instance, upon receiving such petition, shall notify the Government, through
the <span style="">Solicitor </span>General." <span style="">About </span>two <span style="">years back, </span>we held in a case,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
that under Republic Act 931, <span style="">it </span>is
unnecessary to furnish the Director of Forestry a copy of the <span style="">reopen­ing </span>petition "inasmuch as
said Act [931] only required service thereof to the Solicitor General."</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisprudence informs us that "[A]n order of court in a
cadastral case amending the official plan <u>so</u> <u>as</u> <u>to</u> <u>make</u>
<u>it</u> <u>include</u> <u>land</u> <u>not</u> <u>previously</u> <u>included</u>
<u>therein</u> is a nullity unless new publi­cation is made as a preliminary to
such step" and that "<u>additional</u> <u>territory</u> <u>cannot</u>
<u>be</u> <u>included</u> by amendment of the plan without new
publication."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, the jurisdiction of a court to issue orders providing for
exclusion of land included in the original plan is not affected by failure to
order a new publication.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, it should be undisputed that the court already acquired
jurisdiction over the entire territory of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> in the original cadastral case sought to be
reopened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a reservation suit
instituted by the Director of Lands in 1912 (Civil Reservation Case No. 1) to
compel registration of lands in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The final decision therein was rendered on <st1:date year="1922" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1922</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A petitioner who wishes to reopen that case under Republic Act 931 is
thus to be logically considered a claimant in the original cadas­tral
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view has been expressed
that in a sense, the government here is the plaintiff and all the claimants are
defendants,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
who thus become <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Otherwise, the petition should not be one for reopening but one that begins an
entirely new proceeding completely distinct and separate from said case of the
Director of Lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The view we take is not without foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a prospective <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
claims a piece of land by an alleged right that has accrued prior to the
institution of the original cadastral case, a proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>, he is, of course, to be deemed to have received
notice thru the publication therein made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If his rights are derived from the government after the land has been
declared part of the public domain by the cadastral court, then notice to the
government of a reopening petition as provided by law, should suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the government is supposed to take up
the cudgels for a public land grantee, or, at the very least, notify the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that a
petition for reopening under Republic Act 931 can successfully be blocked if it
is shown that the land involved therein has already "been alienated,
reserved, leased, granted or otherwise provisionally or permanently disposed of
by the Government."</p>

<p class="BODY">True, <u>Director</u> <u>of</u> <u>Lands</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Benitez</u>,
L-21368, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1966</st1:date>,
ruled that the petition to reopen filed <u>in</u> <u>that</u> <u>case</u> under
Republic Act 931, must be published as required in Section 1 of the Cadastral
Act (Act 2259) because such case is still governed by the procedure laid down
by the latter law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>Benitez</u>
case, however, must be read in its factual context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, the petition of the Benitez spouses for
reopening the cadastral proceedings covering the entire city of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:place></st1:city>, was based on the claim
that "through oversight, inadvertence and excusable neglect a portion
of" 1,805 square meters of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2157 of the land
originally registered in the name of petitioners therein "has not been
included in the original survey." They prayed that after appropriate
proceedings, said portion (designated as Lot No. 1 of the subdivision plan) be
adjudicated to them pursuant to Republic Act 931.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, back of the <u>Benitez</u>
declaration that publication is necessary is jurisprudence heretofore stated,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
that such publication is required when addi­tional territory is sought to be
included in the original plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the record of <u>Benitez</u> in this Court shows that the opposition to the
reopening petition is predicated on the averment that the cadastral court did
not include the lots in controversy because those lots were "part of the
offshore land" and hence, of the public domain which could not be the
subject of cadastral survey or of the cadastral case.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To hold without qualification that failure of publication is
jurisdictionally fatal in reopening cases under Republic Act 931 is to inject
into our statute books something not required.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the subject matter of the petition for reopening - a
parcel of land claimed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia</span> - was
already embraced in the cadastral proceedings filed by the Director of
Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently, the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> cadastral court already
acquired jurisdiction over the said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition, therefore, need not be published.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the authority of the cadastral court over the reopen­ing
proceedings below is not impaired by failure of publication.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. This brings us to the next question:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does petitioner Virginia L. de Castro have
legal standing in the proceedings below?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an early case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court declared that mere citizens could
have </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">interest in public land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time, this Court also held
that to give a party standing in a court of land registration, he must make
some claim to the property.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Then, in <u>Archbishop</u> <u>of</u> </span><st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="">Manila</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> <u>vs</u>. <u>Barrio</u> <u>of</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Sto</u></span>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Cristo</u></span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court pronounced that although an
opponent in a land registration proceeding could not show title in himself, he
was not <span class="SpellE">discapacitated</span> from opposing the registration
</span>sought by <span style="">another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plain was the statement there that "[a]<span class="SpellE">ll</span> that is necessary to enable anyone to exert the faculty
of opposition is that he should appear to have an interest in the
property."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, so this Court
added, "it is immaterial whether this interest is in the character of
legal owner or </span>is <span style="">of a purely
equitable nature as where he is the beneficiary in a trust."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, this Court described a homesteader who
had not yet been issued his title but who had fulfilled all the conditions
required by law, as a person who should be regarded as an <u>equitable</u> <u>owner</u>
of the land.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Similarly, a purchaser of friar land
has an equitable title to the land before the issuance of the patent.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>Pitargue</u></span> <u>vs</u>.

fide applicant of public land may protect his right of Possession and sue for
forcible entry or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> or pursue any
suitable remedy provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
an <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> in a sales application is authorized to
take possession of the land to enable him to comply with the requirements of
the award before title can be issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

that a homestead entry segregates the homestead from the public domain and <span style="">divests </span>the Director of Lands of control
and possession thereof except <span style="">if </span>the
homestead application is finally disapproved and the entry annulled or revoked.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Recently, we declared
that persons who claim to be in posses­sion of a tract of public land and have
applied with the Bureau of Lands for its purchase <u>have</u> <u>the</u> <u>necessary</u>
<u>personality</u> <u>to oppose</u> <u>registration</u>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We have held, too, that an award under a

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under Republic Act 931,
the petition for reopening is narrowed down by the specific conditions therein
set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears repetition to say
that said petition is possible "<u>only</u> with respect to such of said
parcels of land as have not been alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or

Government."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The statute made it abundantly clear that
judicial proceedings shall be reopened only if the cadastral court "shall
find that all conditions herein established have been complied with." Thus
it is, that the alienation, reservation, lease, grant or any provisional or
permanent disposition by the government of the land claimed should suffice to
bar reopening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner Virginia de
Castro here, it must be recalled, is an <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> in
the public bidding held upon her own township sales application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the award up to now has not been
fully implemented because she has not yet complied with one condition imposed
on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, if the award is not a
permanent disposition, it is at least a provisional one, enough to prevent
reopening by respondent <span class="SpellE">Akia</span> as to the land disputed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, accordingly, rule
that petitioner has legal standing before the cadastral court below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she was at first allowed by respondent judge to intervene in the present
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had presented all her
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so had re­spondent <span class="SpellE">Akia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, the
controversy between the two was already ripe for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the motion of <span class="SpellE">Akia</span>
to throw out petitioner's opposition for want of personality to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite petitioner's objections thereto,
respondent judge granted said motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner asked for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was rejected by respondent judge, not on the ground originally set
forth, but on a certain "Manifes­tation" of the Director of Lands
that petitioner's award had already been cancelled, because she failed to make
the necessary improvements on the property, a condition tacked to the
award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That revocation <span style="">was done without notice to petitioner who
came to know of the existence thereof only <u>after</u> <u>she</u> <u>had</u> <u>presented</u>
<u>her</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>In</u> <u>this</u> <u>case</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Worse, petitioner was not
served a copy of that manifestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was not given a chance to explain - in the Bureau of Lands and </span>in court
- why she failed to introduce improvements on the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was finally apprised of the action
by the court, she moved to reconsider.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told the court that she had sought reconsideration from the Bureau
of Lands of the cancellation of her award because <u>it</u> <u>was</u> <u>an</u>
<u>impossibility</u> for her to make the necessary improvements on her property
as there were no lighting, water and road facilities in the area, and that when
she was about to construct her house after­wards, she was told by the City
Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> that she could not be issued the
required building permit for the reason that her lot was included in respondent
<span class="SpellE">Akia's</span> reopening petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She even made it of record in court that
because of her letter of reconsideration, the Director of Lands issued a
memorandum to the Office of the bureau of Lands in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> directing <u>reexamination</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>cancellation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was nothing more that petitioner could have done at that time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent judge should
have taken all these facts into consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While petitioner's plea for reconsideration before the Bureau of Lands
was pending, appeal by petitioner from respondent judge's order would have been
futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, <u>there</u> <u>was</u> <u>then</u>
<u>nothing</u> <u>definite</u> on which to base her appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, there was really nothing to do but to
wait.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, respondent judge
should have taken stock of the fact that petitioner was at an obvious
disadvantage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be here
stressed that the court manifestation of counsel for the Director of Lands
heretofore adverted to was explicitly "without prejudice" to the
Director's right "to submit further evidence within the period allowable
by law, if future </span>cir­cumstances <span style="">so
warrant." Respondent judge should have waited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But </span>he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Add to this the fact that if the court in
this case should grant <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title to <span class="SpellE">Akia</span>, then all the rights of petitioner would be
foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where else could petitioner
go to establish her claim?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when
respondent judge finally shut out petitioner's opposition, we perceive a grave
abuse of discretion which calls for the corrective powers of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The injustice suffered by
petitioner becomes the more accen­tuated by the fact that shortly after the
court order throwing peti­tioner's case out of court, the Director of Lands did
set aside the order Of revocation and reinstated petitioner's award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well it is to remember that "<u>[c]<span class="SpellE">ourts</span></u> <u>ordinarily</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>deny</u>
<u>the</u> <u>writ</u> [of certiorari] <u>if</u> <u>the</u> <u>result</u> <u>would</u>
<u>be</u> <u>to</u> <u>deprive</u> <u>a</u> <u>party of</u> <u>his</u> <u>substantial</u>)
</span><u>rights</u> <u>and</u> <u>leave</u> <u>him</u> <u>without</u> <u>remedy</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
