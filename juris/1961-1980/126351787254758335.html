<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Amalia</span> B. Celeste, under
confinement in the jail of the City of Manila, invoking the protection that
habeas corpus affords, would seek the restoration of her liberty, alleging the
nullity of a decision of the Court of Appeals of March 2, 1966, now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, convicting her of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, the only thing lacking being the reading of the
sentence by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would
support such a plea on her being acquitted by an earlier Court of Appeals
decision on what she alleged to be essentially the same transaction, the sale
of jewelry on commission, considered in such decision as giving rise at most to
a civil liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were different
cases filed apparently as there was more than one offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no specific
claim that thereby there <span style="">was a denial </span>of
constitutional right, but it was more than hinted at in her petition, which
would characterize the circumstances under which she was deprived of liberty as
"utterly illegal and [unchristian if not inhuman." Apparently not
unaware that her petition could have been more strongly buttressed in the law,
she would <span style="">likewise invoke
"humanity, justice and equity" to regain her freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, feels that even with all
the sympathy that her plight evokes, there is no legal justification that would
entitle her to the writ prayed for.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This petition for habeas
corpus originally started as a special proceeding for <i>certiorari</i>,
injunction and <i>mandamus</i> </span>against the Court of Appeals and
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>
whom she would enjoin from reading the aforesaid decision <span style="">of the </span><span style="">Court </span>of <span style="">Appeals of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
would have this Court annul it, notwithstanding its <span style="">finality, justifying her rather unorthodox plea on the ground, above
noted, that earlier on April </span>11, 1960, another decision of the Court of
Appeals considered the liability she incurred </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">a result of <span style="">a </span>transaction wherein she was given
jewelry for sale <span style="">on commission </span>basis
as civil in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">alleged offended </span>party in that <span style="">case </span>was a certain Victoria <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="">de</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Court
of Appeals decision <span style="">where she was
convicted for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, while </span>it <span style="">was </span>apparent that the transaction did <span style="">occur at about </span>the same time, the
complainant <span style="">was </span>a certain <span style="">Eden <span class="SpellE">Patdo</span>, who </span>entrusted
the jewelry to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the holding
of the Court of Appeals in this case that the agreement being <span style="">clear to the effect </span>that if she were
not successful in <span style="">selling the same she
was under obligation </span>to return them and there being a failure on her
part to do so resulting from her entrusting <span style="">them to a </span>third party, who apparently <span style="">was </span>another sub-agent, she would be held liable for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While the decision was
rendered as far back as </span><st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner alleged that she never knew
about its <span style="">existence </span>as her
previous lawyer did not notify her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
thus became final but no reading could be had in the meanwhile as she was <span style="">out on liberty </span>under bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="12"><span style="">December 13, 1969</span></st1:date><span style=""> that she was arrested and lodged in jail
pending the reading of the sentence which she would, in her original petition,
postpone indefinitely while this Court was passing on the question on whether
or not its nullity could <span style="">be decreed </span>considering
the above circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This proceeding
was filed on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="1"><span style="">January 5, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January 8, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> she sought to convert it into <span style="">a petition for habeas corpus, based on the
same facts but insisting on the illegality of her detention, not to mention
what she considered </span>its unchristian if not inhuman character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1970</st1:date>,
this Court, adopted a resolution commanding the warden of the City Jail to
appear and produce the body of petitioner before it and <span style="">to make </span><span style="">a </span>return <span style="">of </span>the writ on <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1970</st1:date>. Such a return <span style="">was </span>duly made, the offense charged,
according to such Acting City Warden, being <span style="">one </span>for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision convicting petitioner on appeal <span style="">was </span>affirmed by the Court of Appeals, as already made mention
of, on <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above facts, this Court finds <span class="GramE">itself</span> unable to accede to the plea of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to deny the <span style="">latitudinarian </span>scope of the writ of
habeas corpus as the most effective remedy against <span style="">illegal restraint or detention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Correctly has </span>it been aptly referred to as protean in its <span class="GramE">reach.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty is
thus cast on the judiciary to put an end to any form of denial of physical
freedom, which in a constitutional regime <span style="">is </span>intolerable except according to law No deviation from the
legal norm is permissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in that
sense that Chafee could refer to it <span style="">as
</span>"the most important human rights provision" in the fundamental
law.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
That is to assure the rule of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it was affirmed in one of the truly outstanding opinions of
Justice Malcolm, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Lukban</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As <span style="">was </span>there stated: "The writ
of habeas corpus was devised and exists as a speedy and effectual remedy to
relieve persons from unlawful freedom."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It<span style=""> cannot be denied, </span>to follow
the language of a leading American Supreme Court decision, that <span class="GramE">while</span> the writ "is simply a mode of procedure, its
history is inextricably intertwined with the growth of fundamental rights of
personal liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its function has
been to provide a prompt and efficacious remedy for whatever society deems to
be intolerable restraints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its root
principle is that in a civilized society, government must always be accountable
to the judiciary for a man's imprisonment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it has the procedural advantage, to paraphrase Holmes,
of cutting through all forms and going to the very tissue of the structure.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no higher duty cast on courts then
than to maintain it unimpaired and to assure the utmost respect for the
amplitude of its coverage.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
So we have consistently acted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
not allowed technicalities to stand in the way of the writ being given the
effectiveness and efficacy, implicit in its recognition in our Constitution.
There is no thought of our deviating from such a norm. That would be to fail to
accord supremacy to its dictate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The moment, however, the detention or confinement is the result
of a process issued by the court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or
sentence, a different question arises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writ ordinarily cannot be availed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It still may be invoked though if the
process, judgment or sentence proceeded from <span style="">a </span>court or tribunal the jurisdiction of which may be
assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it had authority to
act at the outset, it is now the prevailing doctrine that a deprivation of
constitutional right, if shown to exist, would oust it of jurisdiction. In such
a case, habeas corpus could be relied upon to regain one's liberty.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, while the original suit was for <i>certiorari</i>,
injunction and <i>mandamus</i>, it was subsequently converted primarily to a
habeas corpus proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to
be attended with success, not being persuasive enough to justify the issuance
of the writ prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
explicit allegation of a denial of a constitutional right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the most, such <span class="GramE">an
intimation</span> is sought to be yielded by the circumstances above narrated
which could indicate that on what practically appeared to be the same
transaction resulting, however, in two criminal actions in view of there being
more than one offended party, two divisions of the Court of Appeals, which
passed on the matter, reached different conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the 1960 decision, petitioner's liability
was declared to be merely civil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
1966 decision, which petitioner would have annulled, she was held criminally
liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact, however, that the later decision is admittedly now
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, interposes a bar to any judicial
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, recourse must be had
to executive clemency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So this Court
holds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two members of this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
however, while in conformity with such result, the controlling legal principles
being what they are, would not be averse to a further inquiry on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner could thus be
afforded an opportunity to explain precisely, if she could, why under the
circumstances an element of arbitrariness could be plausibly asserted and maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A due process question might arise. Then if
there were really such a denial, this habeas corpus petition would not be
impressed with the apparent hopelessness which now characterizes it,
considering only the pleadings thus far submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court, however with full support from
settled doctrines views the matter differently, it being undeniable that the
petition on its face lacks merit, the above observation falls short of calling
for a different outcome.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So is the original petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
injunction and <i>mandamus</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to costs.</span></p>
