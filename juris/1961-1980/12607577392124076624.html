				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 3 June 1957, in the Court of First Instance of Manila the Land Settlement 
and Development Corporation<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> brought an 
action against Carolino Munsayac to recover two sums of money and interests due 
thereon. It alleged, as first cause of action, that on 9 December 1946 the 
defendant purchased from the Agricultural Machinery and Equipment Corporation 
(AMEC) two tractors, crawler, International TD-9, for and in consideration of 
the sum of P9,777.50, payable by installment as follows: P2,444.38 upon the 
signing of the contract and P7,333.12 in three equal annual installments, the 
first, second and last installments to be due and payable on 9 December 1947 and 
on the same date every year thereafter, any amount remaining unpaid to bear 
interest at the rate of 4% per annum and the stipulated interest to be 
compounded upon failure to pay any installment due; and that to secure payment 
of the balance of the purchase price and interest thereon, the defendant 
executed a chattel mortgage on the said tractors in favor of the AMEC without 
prejudice to the right of the latter to exact fulfillment of the obligation 
undertaken by the defendant under the contract in an ordinary action (Annexes A 
&amp; B); and as second cause of action, that on 29 April 1947 the defendant 
purchased from the same corporation two tractors, one model TD-18 and another 
model TD-9, for and in consideration of the sum of P5,922.50, payable by 
installment as follows: Pl,480.61 upon the signing of the contract and P4,441.87 
in three equal annual installments, the first, second and third installments to 
be due and payable on 29 April 1948 and on the same date every year thereafter, 
any amount remaining unpaid to bear interest at the rate of 4% per annum and the 
stipulated interest to be compounded upon failure to pay any installment due; 
and that to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price and the interest 
thereon, the defendant executed a chattel mortgage on the said tractors in favor 
of the AMEC, without prejudice to the right of the latter to exact fulfillment 
of the obligation undertaken by defendant under the contract in an ordinary 
action (Annexes C and D); and that as of 15 February 1957, the total amount of 
the defendant's indebtedness to the plaintiff on the two causes of action is 
P2,l85.67, the unpaid balance of the purchase price of the four tractors and 
accumulated interest for failure to pay on time the installments due, stipulated 
at the rate of 4% per annum (Annex E); that notwithstanding repeated demands 
made by the plaintiff upon the defendant to pay his indebtedness, the latter has 
refused and failed to pay it; and that by reason of such refusal and.failure to 
satisfy the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff has incurred damages in the form of 
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation amounting to 25% of P2,l85.67. It, 
therefore, prayed that the defendant be ordered to pay it the total sum of 
P2,185.67, with interest thereon at the rate of 4% per annum from 16 February 
1957 to 3 June 1957 when the complaint was filed, and thereafter at the lawful 
rate until the whole amount be fully paid; 25% of P2,185.67 as attorney's fees; 
and the costs of the suit, and for other just and equitable relief (Civil No. 
32687).
<p>On 13 July 1957 the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's 
complaint on the ground that the Court has no jurisdiction of the subject matter 
of the complaint and that the complaint states no cause of action. In support of 
his motion, he claimed that as shown in the statement of account, Annex E, his 
total indebtedness to the plaintiff is P1,927.28 only excluding interest; that 
under the provisions of section 44(<i>c</i>), in relation to section 88, of 
Republic Act No. 296, as amended, courts of first instance have original 
jurisdiction "in all civil cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or 
the value of the property in controversy, amounts to more than two thousand 
pesos;" that in view thereof the Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine 
the plaintiff's claim; and that there being no allegation in the plaintiff's 
complaint that its claim had not yet been paid, it "has not alleged facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant." On 30 July 
1957 the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant's motion to dismiss, 
disputing the defendant's claim. On 3 August 1957 the Court denied the 
defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of merit and ordered him to answer the 
complaint within ten days from receipt of notice of the order. On 20 August 1957 
the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the foregoing order. On 7 
September 1957 the Court denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p>On 25 September 1957 the defendant filed his answer admitting the allegations 
contained in paragraphs 1 to 9 but denying the allegations contained in 
paragraph 10 of the complaint, claiming that the "plaintiff never made any 
extrajudicial demand for the payment of defendant's indebtedness;" and setting 
up the affirmative defenses that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject 
matter of the complaint for reasons already stated and that the plaintiff was 
not entitled to collect from him attorney's fees and expenses of litigation for 
lack of stipulation in their contract.</p>
<p>At the hearing held on 21 October 1958, neither the defendant nor his counsel 
appeared despite previous notice. On the same date the Court rendered judgment 
holding that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * By reason of the admission in defendant's answer there remains no 
question of fact to be tried by this Court and the only question is one of law. 
* * *. Under Sections 4 and 5 of Article 2208, NCC, the Court may award 
attorney's fees even in the absence of any stipulation in the cases therein 
related, one of which is where the defendant acted in bad faith in refusing to 
satisfy plaintiff's plainly valid and demandable claim, and also in the case of 
a clearly unfounded proceeding against the plaintiff. In the mind of this Court 
these provisions apply squarely on the facts of the present case. (pp. 53, 
54-55, rec. on app.)</p></blockquote>
<p>and ordering the defendant—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * to pay the plaintiff the sum of TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE 
PESOS AND SIXTY-SEVEN CENTAVOS (P2,185.67), with 4% interest thereon from 
February 16, 1967 until the filing of the complaint on June 3, 1957, and 
thereafter, at the legal rate of 6% until the whole amount is paid to the 
plaintiff, plus P200 as attorney's fees, and the costs of this action. (pp. 55, 
rec. on app.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendant has appealed to this Court on questions of law only.</p>
<p>At the time of the. filing of the appellee's complaint the jurisdictional 
amount originally cognizable by courts of first instance was limited to more 
than P2,000.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>The appellant presses the question of jurisdiction. It is a settled rule that 
when a party has several claims for money against another arising from different 
transactions, he may sue for recovery of the total amount in a single 
complaint.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> The totality of his claims 
exclusive of costs and interests determines the jurisdictional amount of the 
court.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p>It appears that the parties have stipulated that "any amount (of the purchase 
price or installment) remaining unpaid shall draw interest at the rate of 4% per 
annum" (Annexes A and C) and that unpaid interest shall be "compounded upon 
failure to pay the installments due" (Annexes B and D). It also appears in the 
statement of account, Annex E, that in the first account (C.F. No. 307), the 
appellant had an unpaid balance of P63.98 as of 3 June 1955 and P4.38 interest 
due thereon at the rate of 4% per annum from that date to 15 February 1957; that 
in the second account (C.F. No, 657), the appellant had an unpaid balance of 
P1,863.30 as of 20 September 1953 and P254.01 interest due thereon at the same 
rate from that date to 15 February 1957. Pursuant to the appellant's undertaking 
that interest unpaid shall be compounded or added to the principal indebtedness 
upon failure to pay the installments due, the interests due on the respective 
amounts became part of the principal. Adding up all the outstanding accounts 
unpaid and the interests due thereon, we have P2,185.67 as the total amount due 
from the appellant, which was then within the jurisdictional amount cognizable 
by the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>Even if the interests of P4.38 and P254.01, or a total of P258.39, be 
excluded from the total amount of P2,185.67, claimed by the appellee, thereby 
reducing its claim to only P1,927.23, still the case remained within the 
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, because the appellee alleged in its 
complaint "that notwithstanding repeated demands made by the plaintiff 
(appellee) on the defendant (appellant) on the amounts of the First and Second 
Causes of Action, the latter has in gross and evident bad faith, neglected, 
failed, and refused and continues to neglect, fail and refuse to pay his account 
long overdue; and that by reason of the defendant's (appellant's) neglect, 
failure and refusal to satisfy the plaintiff's (appellee's) valid, just and 
demandable claim, the plaintiff (appellee) incurred damages in the form of 
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation amounting to 25% of P2,185.67, the 
plaintiff's (appellee's) claim under this complaint," and prayed that the 
appellant be ordered to pay it "damages in the form of attorney's fees amounting 
to 25% of P2,185.67, the plaintiff's (appellee's) claim under this complaint." 
Consequential damages and attorney's fees, when properly recoverable as an item 
of damage, are not excluded from the jurisdictional amount, is the rule in 
Suanes <i>vs</i>. Almeda-Lopez, 73 Phil. 573. Therefore, consequential damages 
and attorney's fees, when properly recoverable as an item of damage, is included 
in the jurisdictional amount. Article 2208 of the Civil Code provides that "In 
the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other 
than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except; (5) Where the defendant acted 
in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's plainly 
valid, just and demandable claim." Twenty-five per cent of P1,927.28 amounts to 
P481.82. Adding these two amounts, we have a total of P2,409.10, which brings 
the total claim of the appellee within the jurisdiction of the Court of First 
Instance.</p>
<p>The appellant in his answer having admitted the material averments of the 
appellee's complaint except paragraph 10, claiming that the latter did not make 
any extrajudicial demand for payment of his indebtedness, and not having 
introduced any evidence in support of its defense, is now precluded from raising 
questions tending to inquire into the facts of the case as alleged in the 
appellee's complaint and expressly admitted by him in the answer.</p>
<p>The appellant contests the legality of that part of the judgment ordering him 
to pay interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 4 June 1957 notwithstanding the 
fact that the stipulated rate is 4% per annum on unpaid accounts. In other 
words, he claims that the rate of interest for which he should be liable is only 
4% per annum on unpaid accounts from the date the installments were due until 
they are fully paid. The appellant is in error. The 4% interest stipulated by 
him and the appellee is penalty for failure to pay on time the installments due 
while the 6% interest imposed by the trial court from 4 June 1957 is penalty for 
failure to satisfy the plaintiff's valid and demandable claim after 
extrajudicial demand. In the absence of stipulation for the latter eventuality, 
the lawful rate of 6% should be imposed. This the trial court correctly did.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L.,
