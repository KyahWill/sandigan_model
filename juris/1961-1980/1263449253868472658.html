<p class="BODY">The decision under appeal provides <span class="GramE">Us</span>
with the following background facts as found by the Court of Appeals, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In the national election held on Novem­ber 11, <span style="">1957, </span>the late <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span>, said to be a rabid and influential leader
of the <span class="SpellE">Na­cionalista</span> Party, staunchly and vigorously
sup­ported said party's candidate, Dr. Jose D. Mo­reno, for Congressman for the
lone congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four defendants above-mentioned were
die-hard followers of Atty. and ex-Governor <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span>
Q. Mayor who was the can­didate of the Liberal Party and whom they uncon­ditionally
supported, being their political boss and personal idol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears that on November 19, 1957, in the evening,
ex-Governor Mayor arrived in <span class="SpellE">Ca­jidiocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
to console him in his recent defeat, his leaders gave a party in his honor in
the house of Juan Ramiro where he put up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A program was held in which <span style="">a </span>sound
amplifying system was used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span>, a school teacher, acted as master of
ceremonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those who attended
were <span class="SpellE">Con­rado</span> Ramos, then the incumbent vice-mayor of
<span class="SpellE">Cajidiocan</span>, and his younger brother, Gregorio
Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin sang over the microphone
a song called ‘Sentimental Journey', to Dodge City, which was followed by the
remarks:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Before I proceed to Dodge
City, I will bring first <span class="SpellE">Rufi­no</span> <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span>
and his brother-in-law, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Calsado</span>, to the
cemetery'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, Benja­min
referred to his impending transfer as a barrio teacher to far away barrio <span class="SpellE">Ayabag</span>, which transfer he attributed to the work of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span>, a public health
nurse, and the lat­ter's brother-in-law, Municipal Judge Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Calsado</span>, on account of his having supported defeated
candidate <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> Mayor in the elec­tions just
finished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following day, November 20, <span style="">1957, </span>in the <span style="">afternoon </span>at
about <span style="">5 </span>o'clock, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Ro­vira</span> and Gregorio Ramos were in the public kiosk in the <u>Plaza</u>
of <span class="SpellE">Cajidiocan</span>, with several friends. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>From there, they went to a certain corner
store where shortly afterwards <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span>, a cou­sin of <span style="">Benjamin,
</span>arrived with his face swollen and reddish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> told
Benjamin that he was boxed by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span> in barrio <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>,
about 1-1/2 <span class="SpellE">kms</span>. <span class="GramE">from</span> the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>, and that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
was waiting there for Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being so informed,
Benjamin to­gether with Gregorio Ramos proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, they were joined by <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> who was armed
with a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin also had a <span class="SpellE"><u>balisong</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were two parallel roads - the new and the old - from the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> to <span class="SpellE">Cam­bajao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin, Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
took the new road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Ramos was seen walking fast along the old road and picking up a stone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bridge spanned the <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>
<span class="GramE">river</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Conra­do</span> reached the bed of the old river, Benjamin,
Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> were about to reach the
bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at this juncture that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, in a voice loud enough to be heard by the three
and other people nearby, among whom being Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dianco</span>,
told the three:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'You hurry so that we
can overtake them'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin cautioned <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, saying, 'Keep quiet, we might be heard that we
have intentions'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the <span class="GramE">trio were</span> already approaching the bridge, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> further told them:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'You advance (<span class="SpellE"><u>atraca</u></span>)'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> momentarily
joined the <span style="">three </span><span style="">at</span><span style=""> </span>the new road, but subsequently separated and went down the
other side of the new road near the bridge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, Patrolman Alvaro <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span>,
who was told by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Besas</span>,
a school teacher, about the expected trouble, rushed to barrio <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span> in time to stop Gregorio Ramos, Ben­jamin <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> at the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span> held Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> by the arms and succeeded in stopping them from
pro­ceeding to <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allowed Gregorio Ramos to proceed because
the latter said that he was just going to the barrio and that he was not
concerned with the two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> protested that they were being detained but
somehow Pat. <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span> was able to hold them at bay for
several minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was advising them to
go <span style="">back to </span>town, but they said
'Wait for a <span style="">while'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>At <span style="">this </span>instant, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Ramos was seen
deviating to the right to avoid the po­liceman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the bridge, Gregorio Ramos proceeded to the place where <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span> was with several
companions in front of the store of <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
Ramiro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When about <span style="">6 </span>meters from <span class="SpellE">Ru­fino</span>,
Gregorio bent down to roll up his trou­sers, once on the left side and once on
the right side, and on straightening up, he took out of his pocket his <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">balisong</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>which he opened at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, he told <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span>, '<span class="SpellE">Pinong</span>, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">celebracion</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>ta</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>na</u></span></span><u>'</u>, at the same
time charging at <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span style="">with th</span>e open knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appa­rently,
taken by surprise, being unarmed, and having had no ill-feeling or misunderstanding
with Gregorio, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> took to his heels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gre­gorio chased after him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While running, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
slipped and fell down, face up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
position, he was stabbed three times in rapid succession by Gregorio, the most
fatal being the stab into the heart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gregorio then ran towards the town.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Salvio</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Dianco</span>, who
was with <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>, threw a stone at Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other companions of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
made no move to go to the latter's rescue during the stabbing as the trio,
Benja­min, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>,
were in sight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On seeing his brother
stoned at, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, in turn, threw <span style="">a </span>stone at <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Salvio</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">When
Gregorio, running, passed by Benjamin and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
on the bridge still being held by Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span>,
he told them shouting, 'I have already stabbed <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span>;
he is already dead'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio
surrendered to the Chief of Police with his <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">balisong</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>telling said officer <span style="">that he had </span>stabbed to death <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Go<span style="">tangco</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same night, in the municipal build­ing,
Benjamin's knife was confiscated from him.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The certificate of death issued by the Health Officer of San
Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>, shows that the cause of death of <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span> was 'severe
hemorrhage and shock secondary to stab wounds, multiple', one in the abdomen;
two on the chest, and one on the upper left arm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complaint for murder was filed on <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="11">Novem­ber 21, 1957</st1:date>, with the Justice of the
Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Cajidiocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>,
against the said Gregorio Ramos, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of the trial before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galang</span> were killed and the case as to them was
dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the trial, defendants Gregorio Ra­mos and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Ramos were found guilty of the crime charged [sic]
of murder 'qualified by treachery and attended by evident premeditation as a
generic aggravating circumstance', with the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary surrender in favor of defendant Gregorio Ramos; and applying the
Indeterminate Sentence Law, they were sentenced 'to suffer the penalty of from
sixteen (16) years, eight <span style="">(8) </span>months
and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as minimum, <span style="">to twenty (20) years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal to the Court of
Appeals, the judgment of conviction was affirmed but the penalty imposed was
slightly reduced on the conclusion that evident preme­ditation did not attend
the killing of the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first question for
resolution is the nature of the crime committed by petitioner Gregorio Ramos,
i.e., whether murder or plain homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with peti­tioner's submission that treachery did not attend the
killing of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the lower
court and the Court of Appeals based their conclusion of treachery on the
finding that the attack, though frontal, was <u>sudden</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But suddenness </span>of <span style="">attack <u>alone</u> does not conclusively
show treachery.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is required also that the victim be
completely deprived of a chance to either prepare for </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">fight or retreat.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, where a warning precedes the assaults,
there is no treachery.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts before Us show that Gregorio, who <span style="">was alone, was </span>about <span style="">6 </span>meters away from the victim, who was
with several companions, when he hurled what appears to be a challenge - and a
warning also - to the <span style="">latter si­</span>multaneously
or just shortly before he charged with <span style="">his
</span>open <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">balisong</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
though surprised, in the sense that he did not expect any attack at that
precise mo­ment, the victim was not however deprived of opportunity for
countering or evading the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, he was able to run away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">6-meter </span>distance between them and the
challenge hurled at him made this possible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And he probably would have made good his escape from harm but for his
unfortunate slipping down which enabled the pur­suing Gregorio Ramos to
overtake and stab him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even
while down on his back, the victim was not deprived of opportunity to render
less easy the assault upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
testified to by the medico legal expert, the victim was most probably trying to
cover himself with his free arms from the thrusts administered by Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">These considerations all
negative treachery.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, the killing of <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span> cannot
be characterized as simple homicide only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts on record sufficiently establish evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span>
started for <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span> immediately after <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> related to them his tiff with the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,
who was also armed, joined them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Together, they headed for <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span> which was
1-1/2 <span style="">km. </span>away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span> each had a score to settle with the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before reaching the bridge, there was an
exchange of words between the group and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Ramos, who was walking along the old road, wherein <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span>
ex­claimed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“Keep quiet, we might be
heard that <span style="">we </span>have <span style="">in­</span>tentions." The existence of a
criminal plan is clearly inferable from this statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And considering the dis­tance of <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>, the three had sufficient time to re­flect and
deliberate on what they were set out to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while on the bridge, a policeman stopped them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their plan would have been frustrated right
there but for the quick thinking of Gregorio Ramos who was able to convince the
policeman to allow him to proceed on his representation that he had nothing to
do with the other two and was just going to the town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this was a mere pretext is confirmed by
his subsequent actuation culminat­ing in the decedent's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gregorio's giving this pre­text is also the
overt act showing that he was bent on making a success of their original plan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Allowed to proceed, Gregorio lost no time locating the
decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped about six meters
before <span class="SpellE">Gotang­co</span>, and with cool composure, bent down,
rolled up his trousers and then with an open <span class="SpellE"><u>balisong</u></span>
and a loud chal­lenge, charged at the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decedent managed to flee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
grim determination, Gregorio gave chase and overcoming the decedent, stabbed
him repeatedly, inflict­ing mortal wounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The killing was therefore qualified by evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender must
be credited to Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no aggra­vating
circumstance to offset it, this places the penal­ty for murder in the minimum
period which ranges <span style="">from </span>17
years, 4 months and 1 <span style="">day </span>to 20
years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The maximum term of the indeterminate penalty imposed by the Court of
Appeals is within this range, and must therefore be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second question refers to the criminal liabili­ty, <span style="">if </span>any, of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case against him is built solely on the following circumstantial evi­dence:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Two days before the killing of the
victim, or on November 18, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> had a heated
argument, and almost came to blows, with the former in the municipal building;
(2) he belonged to the opposite political group and had supported <span style="">a </span>candidate defeated by the one
backed up by decedent; <span style="">(3) </span>in
the afternoon of November 20, 1957, he was seen walking fast along the old road
to <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span> and picking up a stone while Gregorio
Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>
were trudging along the new road; <span style="">(4) </span>as
the lat­ter neared the bridge, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> was heard to
have exchanged words with them, after which he walked up to the new road, momentarily
joining the three, and continued on down to the other side of the new road near
the bridge; (5) when the three were stopped on the bridge by the policeman, he
was seen deviating to the right to avoid the latter; and <span style="">(6) </span>after Gregorio, his brother, had
stabbed the decedent and on seeing him being stoned at by <span class="SpellE">Salvio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> threw a stone at <span class="SpellE">Salvio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances <span style="">do </span>not,
however, lead <span class="GramE">Us</span> to the moral conviction regarding <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span> guilty participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is room for reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, it must be noted that there was no
evidence showing <span style="">a </span>prior
agreement between the four accused to do away with the dece­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based upon the facts on record, Gregorio
Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span> were impelled to go to <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span> on the afternoon of <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="11">November 20, <span style="">1957</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>when the latter's cousin told the
two that the decedent boxed him and was waiting for <span class="SpellE">Rovi­ra</span>
and one <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Gregorio in <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to this, no occasion is <span style="">shown </span>in the record when all the four
met to­gether.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> could not have known about the inci­dent between <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> and the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was not with his brother Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Rovira</span>
when <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> told them about his encounter with the
decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
did not even walk with them on the way to <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was mere­ly seen walking along the old
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His presence, there­fore, can
reasonably be attributed to chance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, his statements to the three accused as they approached the
bridge cannot be interpreted <u>conclusively</u> to refer to a plan to avenge
the boxing of <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> by the decedent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Third, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> could not possibly have
been a parti­cipant in the plan to harm the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a plan must have been hatched while the
three accused were on their way to <span class="SpellE">Cambajao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> was not
with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he later on joined them
near the bridge, it was momentary only as he proceeded to cross the new road on
to the other side thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again it is
entirely possible that it was while he was thus crossing the new road that he
was seen to be "deviating to the right to avoid the policeman."</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the records show that only Gregorio Ramos stabbed the
decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
was nowhere nearby at the moment of the assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only time when he appeared on the scene
again was when he threw a stone at <span class="SpellE">Salvio</span> who was
throwing a stone at his brother Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence on record that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
saw the stabbing of the decedent by Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, it is possible that he did not see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there is positive finding
that what he saw only was the stoning of his bro­ther Gregorio, and this was
what impelled him to act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stoning of
<span class="SpellE">Salvio</span> was therefore done to protect Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, innocently done in
defense of a relative.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
foregoing circumstances and conclusions are therefore compatible with innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no proof beyond reasonable
doubt of <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span> direct participa­tion in <span class="SpellE">Gotangco's</span> killing, he cannot be considered as a
co-principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> be liable as an
accomplice, nor even as an accessory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts on record do not suffi­ciently establish his guilty
knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was hardly possible for
him to have known of the plan of the three other accused to harm <span class="SpellE">Gotangco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not
at the scene of the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
it was <span class="SpellE">Salvio</span> he stoned, not the decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motive for doing so was not to assist a
principal to escape, but rather to counter the aggres­sion of <span class="SpellE">Salvio</span> who was then stoning his brother Gregorio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, it was not shown that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> was aware of the stabbing of the decedent at that
particula<span style="">r</span> time; hence, he is
not even an accessory.</p>
