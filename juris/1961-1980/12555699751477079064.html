				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Presented before us in this petition for <i>mandamus</i> is the peculiar case 
of party-defendants insisting on, and prevailing party-plaintiffs resisting, the 
execution of a final and executory decision.&nbsp;
<p>To understand this peculiarity, we will state briefly the facts leading to 
the controversy. </p>
<p>After trial in Civil Case No. 770 of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, 
on complaint of Jose, Maria, and Urbano, all surnamed "de la Cruz", to recover a 
parcel of land and damages from Gil San Diego and Rufina San Diego, the Court 
(Hon. Jesus Y. Perez, presiding) rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of 
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the court hereby renders judgment as follows:</p>
<p>"(a) Declaring the deed of sale, Exhibit 3, null and void;</p>
<p>"(b) Ordering the defendants and third-party plaintiffs to vacate the Land in 
question upon payment to them by the plaintiffs and third-party defendants, 
within thirty (30) days after this decision has become final, of the sum of 
THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (P3,500.00);</p>
<p>"(c) Dismissing the counterclaim of the third-party defendants; and</p>
<p>"(d) No pronouncement as to costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court found that the disputed portion of a parcel of land belonged to the 
plaintiffs through hereditary succession; that the defendants built a house on 
the land in good faith, having acquired the land from Catalina Anastacio, mother 
of the plaintiffs, by purchase for P1,000.00. During the proceedings, the 
defendants filed a third-party complaint against said vendor. The vendor (mother 
of plaintiffs) subsequently died; hence, herein respondents, who were the 
plaintiffs, became at the same time third-party defendants in substitution of 
their deceased mother. The court voided the sale on the ground that the vendor 
had no right to the land, but upheld the defense of defendants as builders in 
good faith.</p>
<p>On appeal by the plaintiffs and third-party defendants, the Court of Appeals 
affirmed <i>in toto</i> the lower court's decision, and the same, thereafter, 
became final and executory. Over two years later, the defendants and third-party 
plaintiffs, who were in possession of the parcel of land in litigation, moved to 
execute paragraph (b) of the aforequoted dispositive portion of the decision in 
order to collect the sum of P3,500.00 and thereafter to vacate the premises. The 
motion was denied by the court (Hon. Agustin P. Montesa, presiding), and a 
motion for reconsideration was likewise of no avail. Hence, the instant petition 
for <em>mandamus</em> was filed to compel the respondent Judge to issue the writ 
applied for.</p>
<p>Petitioners' argument is that the pertinent part of the dispositive portion 
of the decision ordains, first, that they vacate the land, and second, that the 
plaintiff pay P3,500.00 within 30 days after this decision becomes final, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"with the connecting preposition 'upon' unmistakably denoting that the second 
(payment of indemnity) is a condition precedent to the first (vacation of the 
premises)." (Memorandum for Petitioners, p. 5)</p></blockquote>
<p>They hold the view that the respondents should pay them first before they 
vacate, and not <i>vice-versa</i>; and that they are entitled now to insist on 
the payment through a writ of execution.</p>
<p>Respondents, upon the other hand, contend:</p>
<p>(1) That petitioners have no right to the writ of execution, because as 
absolute owners of the land, the respondents have the right, under Article 448 
to exercise the option to either pay the value of improvements or demand 
reasonable rent if respondents do not choose to appropriate the building;</p>
<p>(2) That in fact respondents have elected to demand payment of rentals on 
land actually occupied by petitioner's building at TEN PESOS a month, and made a 
demand therefor immediately after the finality of the Court of Appeals decision, 
because the amount of P3,500.00 is exorbitant, so that the land owners chose to 
allow petitioners to remain on the land;</p>
<p>(3) That respondents have long suggested to petitioners that a commissioner 
be appointed to assess the present fair market value of the building, taking 
depreciation into account; and</p>
<p>(4) That the denial of the motion for execution is justified because it is 
premature and has no legal basis.</p>
<p>We find the petition meritorious. The judgment affirmed by the Court of 
Appeals, and now final, explicitly ordains the payment by the respondents de la 
Cruz of the amount of P3,500.00 "within 30 days after this decision becomes 
final" to petitioners San Diego. If it also orders petitioners to vacate only 
upon such payment, it did so in recognition of the right of retention granted to 
possessors in good faith by Article 546 of the Civil Code of the Philippines. 
This provision is expressly made applicable to builders in good faith (Article 
448). The right of retention thus granted is merely a security for the 
enforcement of the possessor's right to indemnity for the improvements made by 
him. As a result, the possessor in good faith, in retaining the land and its 
improvements pending reimbursement of his useful expenditure, is not bound to 
pay any rental during the period of retention; otherwise, the value of his 
security would be impaired (cf. Tufexis vs. Chunaco (C. A.) 36 Off. Gaz. 
2455).</p>
<p>Normally, of course, the landowner has the option to either appropriate the 
improvement or to sell the land to the possessor. This option is no longer open 
to the respondent landowners because the decision in the former suit limits them 
to the first alternative by requiring the petitioners to vacate the land (and 
surrender the improvements) upon payment of P3,500.00. Evidently, the Courts of 
First Instance and of Appeals opined that the respondents' suit to recover the 
property was an exercise of their right to choose to appropriate the 
improvements and pay the indemnity fixed by law. The respondents acquiesced in 
this view, since they did not ask for a modification of the judgment and allowed 
it to become final. Consequently, they can no longer insist on selecting another 
alternative; nor can they be heard now to urge that the value of the indemnity, 
set at P3,500.00, is exorbitant, for the same reason that the judgment fixing 
that amount is no longer subject to alteration.</p>
<p>The judgment ordering payment to petitioners of P3,500.00, by way of 
indemnity, having become final, and the 30 days for its payment having elapsed, 
the court of first instance has the ministerial duty to order its execution 
(Zulueta vs. Paredes, 62 Phil. 5; Buenaventura vs. Garcia, 78 Phil. 759; Amor 
vs. Jugo, 17 Phil. 703; Viquiera vs. Bara√±a, 78 Phil. 456). That duty is 
compilable by <em>mandamus</em>; and the execution is leviable on any property 
of respondents de la Cruz, including the land now in question and its 
improvements.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ prayed for is granted, and the Court of First Instance of 
Bulacan is ordered to issue the writ of execution in favor of petitioners. Costs 
against respondents de la Cruz.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Paredes, 
Dizon,</em> and<em> Makalintal, JJ., </em>concur.</div>
