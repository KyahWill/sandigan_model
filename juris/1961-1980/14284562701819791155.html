				[ G. R. No. L-20711, December 24, 1965</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, SERAPION LIM, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Serapion Lim, a citizen of the Republic of China, was born in Damiao, Bohol, on November 14, 1928. From 1936 he has resided in Ozamiz City. On May 6, 1961 he filed a petition for naturalization, in the Court of First Instance of Misamds Occidental. The petition stated <em>inter alia</em> that Lim is married; that he has two children, one born on August 15, 1957 and another on January 30, 1959; and that his occupation is salesman of Chuan Seng Corn Mill, with a salary of P300.00 monthly.<p></p><p>After publications and trial, the court rendered on October 4, 1962 its decision granting the petition for naturalization. The Republic appealed, raising two questions: First, did petitioner's character witnesses establish the allegations in their supporting affidavit? Second, does petitioner have a lucrative occupation?</p><p>The record shows that petitioner's character witnesses —Maximo Lago and Jose Nunez—failed to testify that petitioner possesses each of the requisite qualifications as possessed by him, and rounded up their testimonies by stating in general terms that he has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications.</p><p>Specifically, the witness Maximo Lago testified merely that petitioner has been continuously residing in the Philippines; has a good reputation, good moral character; believe in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution and is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the Philippines. (Tsn., 4). The witness Jose Nunez stated that petitioner continuously resided in Ozamiz City; is good in mixing with Filipinos; believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution, and believes in the good order and happiness of the Philippines (Tsn., 6). Said witnesses did not establish, for instance, that petitioner had a lucrative employment; is able to speak and write or Spanish and any of the principal Philippine is not suffering from mental alienation or incurable contagious diseases. Such deficiency is fatal because character witnesses must attest in court that petitioner has <em>each</em> of the requisite qualifications (Cuaki Tan Si <em>vs.</em> Republic, L-18006, October 31, 1962).</p><p>Apart from this, however, petitioner's application cannot prosper even on the requisite alone of lucrative occupation. Petitioner, as stated, is a salesman with a salary of P300 monthly (See also, Tsn., 11). Such income amounts only to P3,600 per annum, and petitioner is married and has two children. In Tan <em>vs.</em> Republic, L-16013, March 30, 1963, this Court ruled that an occupation giving an income of P6,300 per annum is not lucrative, for a married applicant with one child.</p><p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization denied, without costs. So ordered.</p><p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal</em> and <em>Zaldivar, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><p><i>Judgment reversed.</i></p></div>
