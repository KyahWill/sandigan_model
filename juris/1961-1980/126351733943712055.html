				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Criminal cases 7050 (L-24373) and 7054 (L-24374) of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Court of First Instance involve separate and distinct
offen­ses imputed to the same five defendants-appellants, namely Manuel
Marquez, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>, Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>,
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Al­contin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first is a prosecution for "robbery in band with homicide" committed
on <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1961</st1:date>, in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Matanao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second is for the crime of "robbery
in band with multiple rape" committed about a month earlier, <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1961</st1:date> to be precise, in <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, another municipality of the same province.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a single decision rendered by the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> court, after a simultaneous
trial, all of the defendants were found guilty on all counts and accordingly
sentenced, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 7050,
the Court hereby sentences each and everyone of the accused to life
imprisonment (reclusion <span class="SpellE">per­petua</span>); to indemnify
jointly and severally the heir of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.00; and
Regina <span class="SpellE">Butay</span>, in the sum of P1,000.00, the value of
the pro­perties robbed; without, however, subsidiary impri­sonment in case of
insolvency; and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 7054, the Court
hereby sentences each and everyone of the accused Manuel Marquez, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>, Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Flo­rencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span>, to suffer an
indeterminate impri­sonment of not less than TEN (10) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor </u>as minimum and not more than
TWENTY (20) YEARS of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal </u>as maximum; to indemnify
jointly and severally <span class="SpellE">Lau­reano</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span>
in the sum of P599.50, the value of the properties robbed, without, however,
subsidia­ry imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Crediting in his favor the mitigating circums­tance of
voluntary plea of guilty, the Court hereby sentences the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> to suffer an indeterminate imprisonment of not less
than EIGHT (8) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> as minimum and not more than FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS
AND ONE (1) DAY of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum; to indemnify
jointly and se­verally with his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span> in the sum of P599.50 without, however, subsidiary
impri­sonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the proportionate costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to Art. 70 of the Revised Penal Code the maximum
period of penalty of each and everyone of the accused in these two cases shall
not exceed forty (40) years."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal in both cases, taken by all the defendants di­rectly
to the Court of Appeals, perforce thrust upon the said tri­bunal a novel and
intriguing problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas in criminal
case 7050, the sentence imposed was life imprisonment, in the other, criminal
case 7054, it was <u>reclusion</u><span style=""> </span><u>temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first case is indisputably within the
exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court, while the second, where
questions of law and fact are raised and the penalties meted out are lower than
life imprison­ment, is <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> initially by the
Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While the Court of Appeals admits that the two cases in­volve distinct
offenses committed in two different municipalities with an interval of one
month in point of time, it nevertheless declined to recognize a case of split
appellate jurisdiction and consequently refused to pass upon criminal case
7054, although it clearly had the duty and the power to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the Court of Appeals, in abdicating its ap­pellate
jurisdiction, was persuaded by several factors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, a single consolidated <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span>
has been accumulated from the hearings simultaneously conducted of the two
offenses to the ex­tent that the record cannot in any way be divided without
impair­ing its comprehensiveness for either case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, a single body of proof intended to
sustain defenses common to both offenses was offered by the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And third, identical errors were assigned on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals would
therefore have only one appellate court review the single decision in these two
cases in order to avoid possible conflict in the final findings of two
appellate tribunals on the common factual aspects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The step suggested would, it is urged,
obliterate duplication of judicial review and facilitate disposal of related
cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the reasons so advanced, the Court of Ap­peals
opted to certify the two cases to us for review, correctly recognizing that
criminal case 7050 for robbery in band with ho­micide falls within the
exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">While few can entertain a brief against the practical ad­vantages
of the single consolidated review suggested by the Court of Appeals, we cannot <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">marshall</span></st1:place></st1:city> any legal justification <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> without directly infringing upon the
jurisdictional boundaries so clearly delineated by our statutes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inescapably can be seen that the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> meted out to the defendants in criminal
case 7050 for rob­bery in band with homicide brought the case, on appeal,
within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 17, par. (4), Judiciary Act of 1948,
as amended, reads -</p>

<blockquote>"The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm on appeal, certiorari or writ of
error, as the law or rules of court may provide, final judgments and decrees of
inferior courts as here­in provided, in --</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(4) All criminal cases involving offenses for which the
penalty imposed is death or life im­prisonment; and those involving other
offenses which, although not so punished, arose out of the same occurrence or
which may have been commit­ted by the accused on the same occasion, as that
giving rise to the more serious offense, regard­less of whether the accused are
charged as prin­cipals, accomplices, or accessories, or whether they have been
tried jointly or separately."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, criminal case 7054 for robbery in band with
multiple rape, the maximum penalty therein imposed being <u>reclusion temporal</u>,
perforce falls within the exclusive ap­pellate jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeals, as so directed by section 29 of the Act mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would have been an entirely different situation had the
offense subject-matter of criminal case 7054 arisen out of the same occurrence
or been committed on the same occasion, as that which gave rise to the offense
subject-matter of criminal case 7050.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were it so, then this Court would be bound to take cognizance of both
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the stark <span class="SpellE">undenied</span>
and undeniable fact is that the two felonies are widely disparate in point of
time as well as locality.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not prepared to infuse, as the Court of Appeals did, a new
meaning to the provisions of the Judiciary Act be­cause its mandates and terms
are specific and unmistakable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
widen the scope of our appellate jurisdiction on the basis of the fact that an
inferior court heard, wisely or not, two distinct and separate cases
simultaneously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such procedure adopted
by the trial court cannot and did not result in the merger of the two
crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rightly so, each case was
separately deter­mined by the trial court, as each should be separately
reviewed on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellate competence
is circumscribed by statute, and is not flux and ferment to be settled by the
exigencies of trial proceedings, much less by the physical composition of the <span class="SpellE"><u>expe­diente</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court therefore limits its review to criminal case 7050 for
robbery in band with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal
case 7054 will be remanded to the Court of Appeals for adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information for robbery in band with homicide (cri­minal case
7050) was read to the accused Manuel Marquez, To­mas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>,
Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span> at
their arraignment on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1962</st1:date>;
they pleaded not guilty to the offense charged, except <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>
who, to the dis­comfiture of his counsels, admitted his guilt in open court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disturbed by this turn of events, the defendants' common counsels
(Marquez was separately represented) moved for a re­consideration of the plea
because, according to them, <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> had previously
agreed with counsels not to plead guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, at the same hearing, the lower court
directed the re-arraignment of <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>; the latter
unequivocally reiterated his confession of guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense counsels did not, however, relent, nor did they abandon
their motion to have <span class="SpellE">Navasca's</span> plea of guilty reconsi­dered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked the court to have <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> examined by a com­petent psychiatrist to verify the
charge of his co-defendants and cellmates that he had become mentally deranged
while in prison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This request was
granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the proceedings, Dr. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Celis</span>
of the psychiatric ward of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
  General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was presented by the defendants to buttress their contention that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> was in­deed suffering from mental aberration at the
time he entered his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court was, however, unconvinced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
maintained the belief that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> correctly
understood the significance of the proceedings taken against him and adequately
appreciated the consequences of his plea.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court thereafter rejected de­fense counsels' insistent demand
that <span class="SpellE">Navasca's</span> plea be changed from guilty to one of
not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">This denial is here assigned as error, to support the con­tention
that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> was convicted without benefit of trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before delving into the merits, we shall first dispose of this
assigned error.</p>

<p class="BODY">If <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> were indeed insane, as his counsels
represented him to be, the proper remedy was one of annulment of his plea and
suspension of his arraignment, and not a change of his plea from guilty to one
of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An insane accused cannot
comprehend the full import of either a plea of guilty or one of not
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His commitment to a mental
asylum, until he recovers normalcy, is imperative.</p>

<p class="BODY">As ordered by the lower court, <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>
was examined by a competent psychiatrist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Celis</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
found him to be suffering from "simple and hebephrenic schizophrenia"
- schizophrenic reaction of a mixed type.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The doc­tor noted in his report that -</p>

<blockquote>"MENTAL CONDITION:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Patient was first presented to the clinic last March 2, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On exa­mination, he was dirty and unconcerned
about his personal grooming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, his responses were spontaneous in a coherent arid relevant
manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dulling of the affect was quite
evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the jail, he saw a
strange vision of a girl several times, and called her by the name of '<span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Initial and succeeding examinations showed patient reiterating his
innocence about the crime attribu­ted to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, in all examinations, he was consistently hallucinated in the
visual sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im­pairment of insight
was also noted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>"PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Basing my finding on the foregoing examination, I believe that the
accused, TOMAS NAVASCA, is suffering from mental disorder called SCHIZOPHRENIC
REACTION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On the witness stand, the psychiatrist
confirmed, on direct exa­mination, that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> was
not of sound mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">The threshold question is therefore whether <span class="SpellE">Navasca's</span>
mental state was of such character as to legally incapacitate him from entering
an efficacious negative or affirmative plea to the indictment when read to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Elaborating on his written report, Dr. Cells declared in court
that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> had the behavior of the withdrawn, was
quiet in his movements, retarded in his responses and somewhat pre­occupied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given, however, simple arithmetic tests, <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> responded correctly although sluggishly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is normal in a cer­tain way, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Celis</span> said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
responses to questions were spon­taneous, coherent and relevant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor further stated that the effect of
schizophrenic reaction on the capacity of a person to comprehend what is asked
him is merely superficial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can and
would understand the meaning of every inquiry made and properly appreciate
proceedings taken against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We concur in the trial court's conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> was legally sane and had the mental capacity
required in law to enter his plea at his arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The over-all testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Celis</span> sustains this position</p>

<p class="BODY">And that is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rest of the defendants even utilized <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span> as their
own witness, and his testimony turned out to be intelligent and
responsive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the trial judge's
own conclu­sion as he watched <span class="SpellE">Navasca's</span> physical
expressions, heard him talk, and evaluated his behavior.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, we find no compelling reason to modify the find­ings of
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now address ourselves to the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the prosecution's evidence, more particularly the aggregate
testimony of <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city> But-ay and <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> But-ay, emerge the grisly events of that hapless
afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 14, 1961, at about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, in New <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Matanao</span>,
province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, a band of robbers, five all told,
each wielding a firearm (although the shape, make and caliber thereof are not
ascertainable from the relevant sketchy testimony on record), swooped down on
the house of <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> But-ay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four of these men barged in through the front
door, and forthwith warned the occupants inside not to resist or shout, on pain
of physical harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regina But-ay, the
wife of <span class="SpellE">Dios­dado</span>, nevertheless seized her four-year
old son and ran for the kitchen door but was there blocked by the fifth armed
robber.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> But-ay, another occupant of
the house, was hauled up to the second floor by a lean man whom she later
identified as the defendant Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arriving there, <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span>
was or­dered to lie on the floor, face down, but even as she did, she noted
that another member of the band, whom she described as having wide facial
features and later identified as the defendant Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>,
was already ransacking a trunk owned by her aunt <st1:city><st1:place>Regi­na</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> lay
on the floor, the defendant Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> flicked
on the radio to loud volume.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
was ordered upstairs by-the same member of the band who had earlier accosted
her at the kitchen door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This member,
then wearing <span class="SpellE"><u>maong</u></span> attire, was recognized by <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> as the defendant <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span> who went up to the second floor with her
aunt.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, successive shots were heard by the wit­nesses
coming from the direction of the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly thereaf­ter another member of the band appeared on the second
floor demanding a fresh supply of bullets from his companions as he had spent
his on one occupant of the house who had resisted him.</p>

<p class="BODY">This member was identified by <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> as the defen­dant Manuel Marquez.</p>

<p class="BODY">After seizing a large <span class="SpellE">clothbag</span>
containing coins of various denominations from one of the trunks in the house,
the defendant Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> queried Regina for more
but the latter had only her wallet to show, then containing a measly one-peso
paper bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marquez who had meanwhile
arrived at the second floor of the house pressed <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
for the rest of her money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
then pointed to a <u>bodega</u> outside the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> joined Marquez in
escorting <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city> to the <u>bodega</u>,
and they went scurrying down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Getting to the kitchen door, <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
saw Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Amaba</span>, one of her compa­nions in the
house, dead on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
the doctor who conducted the autopsy, <span class="SpellE">Amaba</span> sustained
several gunshot wounds which resulted in massive internal hemorrhage leading to
shock and ultimately to death.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, Marquez ordered Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>
to turn up the body of Nicolas, as this was lying face down, remarking that he
had killed him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arriving at the <u>bodega</u>, Marquez asked <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
where her husband was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
answered that he had probably fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
seeing that there was no money to be had in the <u>bodega</u>, Marquez grabbed
a stool from somewhere and hit <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city>
with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With child in arms, she jumped
from the <u>bodega</u> and scampered away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None of the defendants, however, pursued her.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the robbers left together at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7 o'clock</st1:time> in the eve­ning, taking with them money and
valuables, including some pie­ces of jewelry, all of a total value assessed at
P856.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quite obvious from the foregoing disquisition is the ab­sence of
any mention of evidence to inculpate Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of explanation, it must be stated that
<span class="SpellE">Navasca's</span> plea of guilty, which the court unqualifiedly
accepted after a thorough­going inquiry into his mental state, was apparently
taken by the prosecution and by the court as conclusive of his <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> par­ticipation in the commission of the
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might indeed have been much
more desirable that the integrated picture depicted by the prosecution included
details of <span class="SpellE">Navasca's</span> participation, but we are of the
view that this omission does not at all detract from the intrinsic worth of the
narration of the occurrences made by the State witnesses</p>

<p class="BODY">After a painstaking analysis and perceptive scrutiny of the
record in its entirety, we find and so declare that the identi­fication made by
<span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> But-ay and Regina But-ay of the ac­cused
Manuel Marquez, Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span>, and their cumulative positive testimony to the
effect that all these four defendants were present at the scene of the crime
imputed to them, do not suffer from any factual or legal infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No bias of any form, shape or substance is im­puted
to any of these two eye-witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">With this view that we take of the testimonial evidence for the
prosecution, it will serve no useful purpose in the disposition of this case to
resolve the issue, squarely raised by the appel­lants <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span>, Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>
and Manuel Marquez, of the involuntariness of their respective extrajudicial
confessions wherein they admit their essential participation in the of­fense of
robbery with homicide committed in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Matanao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the proffer of alibi made solely by Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> as his basic defense, by now it is almost trite to
say that alibi is amongst the weakest of defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Easy to concoct, it may be pro­perly credited
only if established by convincing and satisfactory proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be clearly shown not only that the
accused was at some other place but as well that it was physically impossible
for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Argao</span>, who was presented by Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>
as a wit­ness in support of his alibi, testified merely that Rogelio stayed at
her house in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>mountain</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Boob</st1:placename></st1:place>
for a period of over a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
unembellished declaration cannot serve to dent the testimo­ny of <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> But-ay who positively identified him as one of the
invading armed robbers and definitively placed him at the <span class="SpellE">situs</span>
of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The final error assigned by the appellants is the denial by the
trial court, at the last hearing of the case, of their request for
continuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears from the
appellants' brief that the rea­son why they insisted on a continuance was to
gain sufficient time to enable them to present one <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> and a certain physician to corroborate the
defendant Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin's</span> asser­tion that he was
violently maltreated by the policemen of <span class="SpellE">Bansa­lan</span>
into signing his extrajudicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The names of the other witnesses which the appellants mention in their
brief, were not brought up when they asked the court for continuance (<span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that the trial court demanded mention
of the names of these witnesses and the time they would be available) and are
obvious afterthoughts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for the
corroborative testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span> and the doctor on the alleged maltreatment of An­dres,
the same would now be superfluous inasmuch as this Court has, in a manner of
speaking, already eschewed the pertinent confessions admitted in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether the trial court
abused its discretion in denying the defendants' mo­tion for continuance may
now therefore be regarded as purely academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>, Jr.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we observed that "with the present wording of article 295 [Revised Penal
Code] there is no such crime as 'robbery with homicide in band.’ If robbery
with homicide is committed by a band the indictable offense would still be
denominated 'robbery with homicide' under article 294(1), but the element of <u>band</u>
... would be appreciated as an ordinary ag­gravating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The offense committed by the five appellants in the case at bar
is that of robbery with homicide, punished by authority of paragraph 1 of
article 294 of the Revised Penal Code with <u>reclu­sion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aggravating circumstance of the crime having been committed by a
band (art. 14, par. 6, of the Revised Penal Code), was alleged in the
information and proven at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of article 63 of the same Code, which prescribes rules for the
application of indivisible penalties, "when in the commission of the deed
there is present only one aggravating cir­cumstance, the greater penalty shall
be applied," and "when both mitigating and aggravating circumstances
attended the commis­sion of the act, the court shall reasonably apply them to
offset one another in consideration of their number and importance." Thus
the punishment that should be imposed on the appellants Ma­nuel Marquez, Andres
<span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span> is
the <u>death penalty</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>, his plea of guilty is offset by the
aggravating circumstance of <u>band</u>; the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> was therefore correctly imposed on him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, in criminal case 7050 for robbery with
homicide committed by a band, this Court affirms the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
insofar as it imposes the penalty of life imprisonment (<u>re</u>­<u>clusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>) on Tomas <span class="SpellE">Navasca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the appel­lants Manuel
Marquez, Andres <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Alcontin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span>, this Court hereby imposes on each and all of them
the <u>death</u> <u>penalty.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amount of the indemnity which all of the five appellants will pay jointly and
severally to the heirs of the deceased Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Amaba</span>
is hereby increased from P6,000 to P12,000.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The indemnity to be paid by them, jointly and severally, to <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span>
But-ay and <st1:city><st1:place>Regina</st1:place></st1:city> But-ay for the mo­ney
and properties carried away by them is hereby reduced from P1,000 to P856,
which latter amount is the sum properly borne by the evidence of record.
Proportionate costs are assessed against all the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Criminal case 7054 for robbery with multiple rape com­mitted by a
band is hereby ordered remanded to the Court of Ap­peals for its proper review,
the same being within its exclusive appellate jurisdiction.</p>
