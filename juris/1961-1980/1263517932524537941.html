				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by certiorari to review the partial decision of
the Court of Industrial Relations dated <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November 9, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> as well as its resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">dated

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>Free Telephone
Workers Union (hereinafter referred to as the union) was the duly certified
bargaining representative of the rank and file employees of the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Company - some 1,345 of them at the inception of this case. <span style="">Sometime </span>prior to <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10"><span style="">October </span>31,
 1964</st1:date>, the expiry <span style="">date </span>of
the <span style="">then existing collective bar</span>gaining
agreement between them, the union sent demands for a new contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the demands was for "an increase <span style="">of salaries by P1.00 per hour per employee
after which a conversion to monthly basis." The demand was later reduced
to P0.90 per hour, staggered over a period of two years at P0.45 every
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PLDT in turn counter-offered
an increase of P0.30 per hour, staggered over a period of </span><span style="">three years at </span><span style="">P0.10 every year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When the negotiations arrived at an impasse the union filed a
strike notice with the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The PLDT then proposed an interim arrangement, namely, an increase of
P0.15 per <span style="">hour
per employee </span>during the period of November 1 through December 31, 1964,
on condition that the strike notice be withdrawn and that if no agreement was
reached on or before December 31, 1964, the wages would be reverted to the
rates in effect prior to November 1, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> rejected the proposal and when
no agree­ment was reached declared a strike on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1964</st1:date>,
the dispute was certified by the President to the Court of Industrial Relations
as falling under Section 10 of Republic Act 875.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as CIR Case No. 51-IPA.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1964</st1:date>,
the Court of Industrial Relations, through Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, rendered a partial decision settling the
demand for <span style="">wage
increase in </span>this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Company is hereby ordered to pay each of its rank and file
employees, numbering 1,345 persons, the amount of Sixteen Centavos (P0.16) <span style="">wage increase per </span>hour
from November 9, 1964, the date of this decision, and to run for a period of
one year thereafter;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The wage increase for the second and
third years was left pending for subsequent adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union moved for reconsideration; and on <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1964</st1:date> the Court <u><span style="">en</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>banc</u>
affirmed the partial decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, with
Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> <span style="">concurring in </span>the
result but dissenting on the matter of some fifty or more employees of the PLDT
who "are not receiving the minimum salaries established in the prevailing
pay scale of the company." "These employees should not be
overlooked," he said, as he saw "no reason <span style="">why they should not enjoy at least the minimum pay established in the
company."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then on November 26, 1965, while the present appeal was pending,
the Court of Industrial Relations rendered what it captioned "Third
Partial Decision," giving the rank and file employees a wage increase <span style="">of P0.16 </span>per
hour per employee for the second year <span style="">(1965-66) </span>and P0.18 per hour for the third
year <span style="">(1966-67),
</span>effective on November <span style="">9, </span>1965
and November 9, <span style="">1966, </span>respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue raised by the petitioner-appellant in this appeal
has to do with the alleged failure of the court below to consider the evidence
as well as the law regarding the payment of minimum wages to the fifty or more
employees referred to in Judge <span class="SpellE">Bugayong's</span> concurring
and dissenting opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reference in
said opinion, it should be noted, is not to the statutory minimum wage but to
the "minimum salaries established in the prevailing pay scale of the company."
But as correctly pointed out by the respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the issue was not one of those before the respondent court; it <span style="">is </span>raised
for the first time <span style="">in </span>this appeal, obviously inspired by the dissent
aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No findings of <span style="">fact thereon have
been made in the decision appealed from, as indeed there was no reason to make
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The matter is therefore not
a proper subject for <span style="">review </span>but should be taken up, if at all, in a separate proceeding
below.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue concerns the conversion of the salaries of the
rank and file employees from hourly to monthly basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the respondent court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
did not rule on this question, and the <span style="">union </span>did not raise it either in its motion
for reconsideration or in its memorandum in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no ruling and no findings of fact
on this point in the decision appealed from, this Court <span style="">is </span>in no position to resolve the issue
intelligently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only ground upon
which the union now wants to rest its demand for conversion <span style="">is </span>the fact
that the respondent company<span style="">’</span><span style="">s</span>
supervisors are paid on the monthly basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ground relied upon is not sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The supervisors belong to a different bargaining
unit and are covered by a separate bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kind of work they perform, their rates of
pay and conditions of employment, as well as other factors may not necessarily
be the same as those which obtain in the case of rank and file employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">would </span>be best therefore to leave this
question to be properly ventilated in and decided by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last issue to be considered is whether the order of the Court
of Industrial Relations granting a wage increase of P0.16 per hour per
employee, effective for a period of one year, is supported by substantial
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The meaning of substantial evidence is long settled in this
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not refer only to
the quantum of the facts presented to support a conclusion but also, and more
importantly, to the quality of those facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind
might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
A reading of the resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
affirming the decision penned by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>, shows
that it easily meets the test of substantial evidence, having taken per­tinent
factors into consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the
said resolution states:</p>

<blockquote>"On the question of the wage increase of P0.16 we believe that
the Trial Court is justified in arriving at the increase therein awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of fact made by the Trial Court,
to our mind, sufficiently justifies the award granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of P0.16 is higher by P0.06 than
the offer of P0.10 made by the respondent firm for the first year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This award is twice as much as the original P0.08
per hour increase at the beginning of 1961-1964 collective bargaining contract
then existing between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that the Trial Court based the said award on several factors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them is the increase of costs of
living in the Manila Area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
Exhibit "1", the consumers' price index of all items in the Manila
Area for 1961 was 113.2; 1962, 119.8; 1963, 126.5; and 1964, 133.3 (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "P").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The wage rate of ordinary wage of a skilled laborer in the Manila Area
for the same period are as follows: for 1961, 104.8; 1962, 106.1; 1963, 109.3;
and 1964, 110.9 (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further indicated that the PLDT rank
and file employees received already a rate of 1.04 in 1961; 1.12 in 1962; 1.21 <span style="">in </span>1963;
1.21 in 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the graph <span style="">shows, </span>the
increase of consumers’ price <span style="">index in </span>the Manila Area was slow and rose gradually, whereas the
rate of wage increase is fast and abrupt during period covered from 1961 to
March 1964 (See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "1-A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">P0.16 </span><span style="">per </span>hour increase award by the court <span style="">is, </span>percentage-wise,
more <span style="">substantial
than </span>that given <span style="">to the </span>supervisors
in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement which took effect in
January 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ratio appears to be
13.4% <span style="">in</span>crease
over the present rates of rank and file employees, while the increase of
supervisors amount to only 7.9% over the average basic rates of said
supervisors immediately before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
their increase beginning with the year 1964.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The award granted by the Trial Court covers only the first year as
indicated in the partial decision of November 9, 1964, and in point of
percentage it is almost double the increase granted the supervisors under the
agreement arrived at in the amicable collective bargaining agreement freely
entered into by the company and the supervisors union free from any compulsory
arbitration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The increase given in the
award of the Trial Court indicated a substantial increase; and at a faster pace
than the increase of cost of living and the rates of skilled personnel in
Greater Manila Area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the graph, it
appears that from 1955 to 1964 the hourly rate of typical hourly rate (sic) of
employees of respondent company increased from 65.8%, while the cost of living
of the average household in Manila and suburbs increased by only 33.3%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this situation if we are to include the
P0.16 per hourly increase award by the Trial Court, the increase <span style="">in </span>the wage
rate of typical rank and file employees of the PLDT is almost three times as
much as the increase of the cost of living in Manila and <span style="">is </span>almost
nine times as much as in the increase of wage rates of the average skilled
employees in the Greater Manila Area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another factor is the prevailing rate of wages for similar nature
of work in the Manila Area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rate of
pay of the rank and file employees of the PLDT is one of the highest <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">Manila </span>Area
if not the highest, and the increase of P0.16 per hour awarded by the Trial
Court is to our mind more than justified and sufficient under the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another factor <span style="">is </span>the interest of the investor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The investor's profit should be just and reasonable after considering
the trend of business enterprise of the respondent firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indicated that they are expanding from
year to year by the reinvestment of surplus earnings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">was necessary </span>in order to meet the exigency
of the service not only in the Manila Area but in all the branches of the
respondent firm for which it was allowed franchise to carry its business.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let it be known that the Trial Court, before issuing any order on the
subject matter of the conflict between the parties endeavored to conciliate
their differences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several formulas were
offered but the parties stood pat on their respective positions without
considering the offer of the court of a solution of the economic differences
that gave rise to the present proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the Court has to receive the evidence of the parties and
endeavored to hear them in evidence at the shortest time possible under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing, the
parties agreed to the proposition that evidence would be submitted to give the
Court the opportunity to arrive at an award for the first year of the economic
demand on the increase of wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
after weighing the evidence <span style="">submitted by the parties, the Trial Court arrived at the award now
involved in the present motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">After hearing the parties
in oral argument and after examining the evidence on record, we feel that the
award of P0.16 <span style="">by the Trial Court is
supported by the evi</span>dence on record and we find no sufficient
justification to alter or modify the <span style="">same."<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not to be overlooked <span style="">in
viewing </span>the union's demand in a balanced perspective is the <span style="">fact that on November 26, </span>1965, after
the instant petition for review was filed, <span style="">the Court of Industrial Relations rendered a "Third Partial
Decision," wherein the rank and file employees represented by the union
were granted a wage increase of P0.16 <span style="">per
hour </span>for the second year, effective November 9, 1965, and another
increase of P0.18 per hour for the third year, effective November 9, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the previous increase of P0.16 for the
first year, effective November 9, 1964, the total gained at the start of the
third year as a result of the initial demands which gave rise to this case, was
P0.50 per hour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the third partial decision aforesaid is not the subject
of review herein, we note nevertheless that the <span style="">lower </span>court has made therein a detailed analysis of the respondent
company's financial situation and found that in 1964 it made a net return of
6.27% on its investment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The projection
made by the same court, if a yearly increase of P0.16 per hour was granted for
the next two years, was that the company would realize a net return of 7.55% in
1965, 4.9% in 1966, and 1.84% in 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, however, the increase actually granted for the third year
effective November 9, 1966, was two centavos per hour more than that which was
made the basis of the projection.</p>

<p class="BODY">These observations, of course, in no way constitute an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the lower court's third partial decision,
which <span style="">is </span>not under review
herein, but are made only to underscore the fact that the increase new
challenged by the union as insufficient is supported by substantial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it has been pointed <span style="">out in its </span>brief by the respond­ent
company, without any denial on the part of the petitioner-appellant, that the
latter appears to consider the additional wage increases as reasonable and did
not even move for their reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution appealed from is affirmed,
without prejudice to any right on the part of the petitioner-appellant to <span style="">present anew in the Court below a claim </span>for
conversion of the salaries of <span style="">its
members to a monthly basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
