				<BR><STRONG>ANTONIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Agusan dated May 13, 1969, finding appellant Amelito Beltran guilty of murder in Criminal Case No. 2769 and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> with all the accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs rf Clemente Pingol in the sum of P6,000.00, and to pay the costs.<br><br>There appears to be no dispute as to the basic fact that on the evening of September 21, 1963, Clemente Pingol was fatally shot from behind with a shotgun while he was in the sala of the unfinished house of Crisanto Tubo at Barrio Tagpangahoy of the Town of Tubay, Province of Agusan.&nbsp; A report of the incident reached the Chief of Police of Tubay and on the following day, September 22, 1963, Chief of Police Zotico Cepeda, Pat. Juanito Antiporda, Municipal Judge Edgardo Batitang, and Dr. Jose Encarnado, of Tubay, proceeded to the scene of the crime.&nbsp; They saw the body of Clemente Pingol sprawled on the floor of the sala in the unfinished house of Crisanto Tubo.&nbsp; As shown by the sketch (Exhibit "A") prepared by Pat. Antiporda, the house is situated 19 meters from the seashore, and consisted of a small sala which was completely open because it had no walls, and the living quarters on the western portion thereof which was enclosed with walls.&nbsp; On the western wall were found two pellet holes (Exhibits "E-3" and "E-4").&nbsp; Northeast of the sala about four and a half (4-1/2) meters away was a coconut tree (Exhibit "A-6").&nbsp; An autopsy on the deceased was performed.&nbsp; According to the necropsy report, the victim sustained eight (8) punctured wounds which were caused by shotgun pellets, the right lung was totally mutilated and the third right rib fractured.&nbsp; Death was due to internal hemorrhage as a consequence of the injury to the right lung and to the brain.<br><br>It was only on September 30, 1963, however, when Ernesto Dua and Raymundo Dua implicated Amelito Beltran as the person who fatally shot the deceased.&nbsp; On the basis of the statements of the Dua brothers, Sgt. Francisco Umbao of the constabulary filed, on October 1, 1963, with the Justice of the Peace Court of Tubay, a complaint for murder against appellant Amelito Beltran.&nbsp; Solely on the basis of the identification made by the Dua brothers, the court <i>a quo</i> found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and rendered the judgment heretofore adverted to.<br><br>Since the conviction of appellant was based on the testimonies of Ernesto Dua and Raymundo Dua, there is, therefore, a need to scrutinize carefully their respective testimonies.&nbsp; Raymundo Dua, 25 years of age, farmer of Tubay, Agusan, testified that at about 8:00 o'clock on the even)ng of September 21, 1963, while he was at the porch of their house at Bo. Tagpangahoy, Town of Tubay, Agusan, conversing with his brothers, mother and father, he saw appellant helping one Felimon Sandigan haul a banca from the sea to the shore; that afterwards, appellant walked past their house carrying a shotgun on his shoulders and proceeded directly towards the house of Crisanto Tubo and upon reaching a coconut tree in front of the house, concealed himself behind said tree and fired with his shotgun at Clemente Pingol; that at the time of the shooting, Pingol was then sitting and facing Crisanto Tubo with whom he was conversing; that Tubo was with his wife and adopted child; that appellant was then about three (3) arms length from Pingol when he fired the shot; that he could recognize the face of Amelito Beltran because of the light coming from a torch locally known as "<i>moron</i>"; that after shooting the victim, appellant Beltran fled from the scene by taking the same route, passing near the porch of the house of the witness; and on the following morning, he went to the house of Crisanto Tubo where the police were already investigating the incident and saw the body of the deceased still sprawled on the floor.&nbsp; On cross-examination, he indicated that their house was about fifty to sixty meters distant from that of Crisanto Tubo, and between those two houses was the unoccupied house of Eulogio Tilleno; that in spite of that distance, he claimed that he could distinctly hear the ordinary conversation going on between Tubo and Pingol who were talking and joking with each other for quite some time in the presence of Anselma, Tubo's wife; that at the time they were conversing, they were facing each other with the back of Clemente Pingol towards the coconut tree; that when he saw somebody aim a shotgun at Pingol, he did not shout because he was afraid; that he did not inform the police immediately of what he saw.<br><br>His younger brother, Ernesto Dua, gave substantially identical testimony.<br><br><center>I</center><br>The important question to be determined is whether the appellant was the person who perpetrated the offense.&nbsp; Examining carefully the evidence of the prosecution about the identity of the assailant, We find that the prosecution's evidence leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; The identity of the offender, like the crime itself, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The question of the identification of an accused as the perpetrator of an offense might seem to be the simplest that could possibly come before a court.&nbsp; But the fact is precisely the reverse.&nbsp; The question of identification has proved itself over and over again, by far, instead the most perlexing.&nbsp; As one court has observed:&nbsp; "There are few more difficult subjects with which the administration of justice has to deal.&nbsp; The carelessness or superficiality of observers, the rarity of powers of graphic description, and the different force with which peculiarities of form or color or expression strike different persons, make recognition or identification one of the least reliable of facts testified to even by actual witnesses who have seen the parties in question. x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the identification of appellant bears heavily on the reasonableness or probability of the testimony of these witnesses.&nbsp; It has been observed that the most positive testimony of a witness may be contradicted by the fact that the testimony is contrary to common observation or experience,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or the common principles by governed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The courts are not required to believe that which they judicially know to be incredible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center>II</center><br>According to appellant, the credibility of the testimonies of Raymundo and Ernesto Dua is impaired by their apparent improbability.&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp; We find it highly improbable that appellant would make his presence so conspicuous to these witnesses by passing near them with a shotgun on his shoulders immediately before and even after shooting the victim.&nbsp; According to the prosecution witnesses, a person can bring his banca ashore immediately behind the house of Crisanto Tubo, and, therefore, can go to the coconut tree in front of Tubo's house without passing by the house of the Duas.&nbsp; It is quite incredible, therefore, that appellant, instead of taking the shorter and more direct route, should have taken the longer and more circuitous route by landing behind the house of the Dua brothers, then walk past the porch of their house where the Dua brothers were conversing with the rest of their family and in plain view of these people, proceed to the place of the victim.<br><br>Considering that visibility was practically nil, as according to the prosecution evidence, the night was so dark that a person ten meters away could not be seen, much less recognized, it is highly improbable that the Dua brothers could have distinctly recognized appellant who was allegedly hiding behind a coconut tree about fifty to sixty meters away.&nbsp; It is true that they claim that they were able to recognize appellant by the light of a torch ("moron"), but the infirmity of this assertion lies in the fact that an assassin hiding behind a coconut tree would certainly not expose his face to the light to enable others to identify and recognize him.&nbsp; Apart from this, according to the sketch prepared by the police (Exhibit "A"), the kerosene lamp was placed inside the sleeping quarters of Crisanto Tubo which was partly enclosed with walls, and not in the sala of the house where Tubo, with his wife and adopted child, were conversing with the victim.&nbsp; Considering the location of the lamp, its limited luminosity and the pitch-black darkness of the night, it is highly implausible that even with the aid of such light, Raymundo and Ernesto Dua could have positively recognized the face of an assailant hiding behind a coconut tree about fifty or sixty meters away.&nbsp; Moreover, if it were true that Crisanto Tubo was talking with Pingol at the time when the latter was shot from behind, it is evident that Tubo was in the best position to see the assailant, but it appears that this person was neither investigated nor questioned by the police in connection with the incident.&nbsp; This indicates that the assailant was able to conceal his presence in such a manner that even Tubo was not able to see him.&nbsp; It should be noted also that the conduct of these witnesses immediately after witnessing a startling occurrence shows lack of spontaneity and sincerity.&nbsp; Thus, after seeing a neighbor killed in a shocking manner, in an apparent indication of lack of concern, they continued chatting until nine o'clock that night, then retired and slept soundly, and although they saw the police authorities inquiring from the people there as to how and by whom the victim was killed, when they went to see the cadaver of the victim in the house of Tubo the following morning, they never bothered to inform the police of what they knew.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="85%">
