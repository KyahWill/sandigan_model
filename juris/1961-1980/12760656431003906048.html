				<BR><BR><p>Appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals. As set forth in 
said decision, the facts are: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears that on June 17, 1932, Marcelo Valdez, now deceased, was issued 
homestead patent No. 19151 covering four parcels of land situated in barrio 
Wakal, Bayombong and Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, together with the improvements 
existing thereon; that said patent having been recordedin the registry of deeds 
of Nueva Vizcaya, Original Certificate of Title No. 542 was issued in the name 
of said Marcelo Valdez; that he and his family had been possessing said parcel 
of land from 1907 to the time they were sold to appellees in 1933 and 1935; that 
since then appellees have been in possession of said parcels of land which have 
an average annual yield of 50 cavanes of palay of 50 kilos each per hectare, 
one-half of which belongs to the tenant and the other half to the owner, the 
current price of a cavan of palay being P9.00; that on April 1936, May 1940 and 
December 1946, appellants Macaria and Cristina, surnamed Valdez, daughters of 
the late Marcelo Valdez, demanded the return of the parcels of land in question 
from appellees but the latter refused to do so; and that on March 1,1953 
appellants Cristina, Vicente and Clemente, surnamed Valdez, formally required 
from appellees the return and delivery of said parcels of land. </p>
<p>"In the light of the foregoing facts, the lower-court dismissed the present 
action hold-ing that appellants having been guilty of laches had lost their 
right to demand the return of the parcels of land in dispute." </p></blockquote>
<p>The Court of Appeals disagreed with this conclusion of the court of first 
instance upon the ground that the "requisites for the existence of the equitable 
defense of laches are not present, in this case" and that:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * even if appellants may be held guilty of laches for having instituted 
this action only on March 23, 1953, after the lapse of almost twenty-one years 
since the homestead patent was issued in the name of the late Marcelo Valdez, 
still they are entitled as heirs of said Marcelo Valdez to recover the parcels 
of land in dispute it appearing that their sale in favor of appellants having 
been made within the period of five years from the date of the issuance of the 
homestead patent, the same was null and void from its execution (Secs. 116, 122, 
Act No.2874 as amended; Labrador <em>et al</em>. vs. Santos <em>et al</em>., 66 
Phil. 579, 58l; Oliveros <em>vs</em>. Porciongcola, 69 Phil. 305, 306; Corpuz 
<em>et al</em>. <em>vs</em>. Beltran <em>et al</em>., 51 Off. Gaz. 5631-5632; 
Angeles et al. <em>vs</em>. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. L-11024, January 31, 
1958). And appellants as heirs of the late Marcelo Valdez had personality to 
institute the present action for the declaration of the inexistence of such 
sale, and such action does not prescribe(Art. 1410, new Civil Code; Eugenio et 
al. <em>vs</em>. Perdido et al., 97 Phil., 41)." </p></blockquote>
<p>The Court of Appeals further held:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On the other hand, appellees claim that they are not bound to pay damages as 
they were possessors in good faith. But they ceased to be such possessors in 
good faith from the time they became actually aware of the flaw in their title, 
and that was on March 23, 1953, when the original complaint in this case was 
filed. Hence, from such date appellees are liable to appellants for damages." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The dispositive part of the decision of the Courtof Appeals, reads:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and another entered 
declaring appellants to be the owners of the four parcels of land in dispute 
with right of possession thereof; ordering appellees to deliver the ownership 
and possession of said parcels of land to appellants; ordering the cancellation 
of transfer certificate of title No. 2213 in appellees' name and the issuance of 
another in appellants' name and ordering appellees to pay appellants in the 
concept of damages the current price of P9.00 per cavan of palay for 25 cavanes 
of palay of 50 kilos each per hectare annually from March 23, 1953, until 
delivery of the parcels of land shall have actually been made to appellants. 
Without any pronouncement as to costs." </p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, the case is now before us on petition for review by certiorari filed 
by the defendants in the lower court, Generoso Baje and his wife Saturnina 
Sacdalan. In their original petition the Bajes assigned eight (8) errors 
allegedly committed by the Court of Appeals; however, in their amended petition 
they maintained that the Court of Appeals had merely erred:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"l. * * * in holding that petitioners deliver possession of the lands in 
question without ordering the respondents to return the purchase price paid 
therefor. </p>
<p>"2. * * * in not holding that the petitioners are entitled to reimbursement 
of the value of improvements introduced by petitioners in good faith and also in 
not holding that the petitioners have the right to retain the land in question 
until they are reimbursed of said value of improvements." </p></blockquote>
<p>With respect to the first assignment of error, it appears that, upon receipt 
of notice of the decision of the Court of Appeals, the Bajes filed therein a 
motion for reconsideration alleging, inter alia, that, if the sales in their 
favor are null and Void, and, accordingly, the lands in question belong to the 
heirs of Marcelo Valdez, said heirs should be sentenced to refund the amounts 
paid by the Bajes to Marcelo Valdez, or the aggregate sum of P3,734. This relief 
was denied by the Court of Appeals, upon the ground:- </p>
<blockquote><p>"That the appellants are not bound to return to appellees the purchase price 
that their predecessors in interest, the late Marcelo Valdez, had received in 
consideration of the sale, appellees recourse being to institute an intestate 
proceedings covering the estate of the deceased Marcelo Valdez and file therein 
a claim for the purchase price paid by them or ;their predecessors-in-interest." <br></p></blockquote><p>
This view is supported by Labrador vs. De los Santos 66 Phil. 579, 581-582 
(November 26, 1938), in which it was held:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The alienation by Santiago de los Santos of his land in favor of the 
plaintiffs Antonio Labrador and Felipe Canonizado was made in violation of the 
provision of section 116 of Act No. 2874, as amended by section 23 of Act 
No.3517, which prohibits the encumbering or alienation of a land acquired as a 
homestead within five years from the issuance of the homestead patent, 
wherefore, it is illegal and void, As the declaration of nullity of a contract 
void ab initio operates to restore things in the state and condition in which 
they were found before the execution thereof, the land in question was returned 
to the ownership of Santiago de los Santos, in his lifetime, and that of his 
children, after his death, with the obligation on the part of said Santiago de 
los Santos to return to the purchasers, the plaintiffs, the price of the sale, 
with interest(Art.1308, Civil Code). Santiago de los Santos being the vendor, 
had the declaration of nullity taken place while he was living, he would have to 
return said price to the purchasers; but having died before the declaration of 
nullity, the plaintiffs should have presented their claim for the return of the 
price in the testate or intestate proceedings of the deceased, and they cannot 
go against the children of the latter inasmuch as the said children inherit with 
the benefit of inventory and only that remaining of the inheritance after paying 
the indebtedness of the testate or intestate. While it is true that the 
defendants inherited the land in question, the price of the sale cannot be 
charged thereon, because the said section116 of Act No. 2874, as amended by 
section23 of Act No. 3517, prohibits the subjection of such land to the payment 
of said obligation which was contracted within five years from the issuance of 
the homestead patent, as above stated. In any event, the plain-tiffs may 
institute the intestate proceedings of Santiago de los Santos and file their 
claim before the committee on claims and appraisal to be named therein." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>This ruling was reiterated in Castro et al. vs. Orpiano, 90 Phil. 49l, 493 
(November 29, 1951), but it is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this 
Court. </p>
<p>After declaring that the sale of a homestead made within five (5) years from 
the issuance of the corresponding patent is null and void and that the heirs of 
the deceased homesteaders "have the right to recover the homestead illegally 
disposed of", we held in Angeles vs. Court of Appeals, 102 Phil. 1006 (January 
3l, 1958), speaking thru Mr. Justice Labrador:- </p>
<blockquote><p>"With respect to the price that the defend-ants -had paid for the land 
P2,500, <i>in view of the rule that no one should enrich himself at the expense of 
another, the return of the said amount by the plaintiffs should be decreed, 
before the plaintiffs may be allowed to recover back the possession of the 
homestead</i>, subject of the action. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"The decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and judgment is 
hereby entered declaring the sale of the homestead null and void, <em>ordering 
the defendants to return the same to the plaintiffs upon payment by the latter 
to them of the sum of P2,500</em>. The claim of plaintiffs for the value of the 
pro-ducts of the land and that of defendants for the expenses in the 
construction of the dike are both dismissed. Without costs in this appeal." 
(Italics ours.) </p></blockquote>
<p>In Medel vs. Eliazo, L-l26l7 (August 27, 1959), the language used was:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is the contention of plaintiffs that the contract of sale was void <em>ab 
initio</em>, therefore, it does not exist in the eyes of the law and so it does 
not have any consideration; consequently, they are not liable to pay or return 
the P1,500, the price of the sale. We agree with the defendant that 
<em>plaintiffs may not enrich themselves at his expense</em>. The sale of the 
homestead in question, having been executed before the expiration of the 
five-year period prescribed by law, it is void, but <em>it does not mean that 
since they continue to be owners of the land, they should not return the sum 
received by them as the sales price. It is acase of mutual restitution incident 
to the nullity ab initio of the conveyance</em> (Santander et. al. vs. 
Villanueva et al., 103 Phil., 1; Felices vs. Irioa, 103 Phil., 125 ”).(Italics 
ours.) </p></blockquote>
<p>Again, under substantially the same conditions, we affirmed, in Companero vs. 
Coloma, 109 Phil., 993a decision of the Court of First Instance of Nueva 
Vizcaya, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, decision is hereby rendered in favor of the 
plaintiffs and against the defendants, ordering the latter to surrender the 
possession of the parcel of land in question to the plaintiffs; and ordering the 
cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2398 in the name of the 
defendant Apolonio T. Coloma, over the parcel of land in question and the 
issuance, in lieu thereof, of another transfer certificate of title in the name 
of the here-in plaintiffs in equal shares, <em>upon reimbursement by them to the 
defendants of the sum of P700.00</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> 
with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date this decision has become 
final. And without special pronouncement as to costs." (Italics ours.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>In a decision penned by Mr. Justice Reyes (J.B.L.),ourselves in Manzano vs. 
Ocampo, 111 Phil., 283 as follows:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We therefore, hold that the sale in question is illegal and void for having 
been made within five years from the date of Manzano's patent, in violation of 
section Il8 of the Public Land Law. Being void from its inception, the approval 
thereof by the Undersecretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources after the 
lapse of five years from Manzano's patent did not legalize the sale (Santander 
vs. Villanueva, G.R. No. L-6184, Feb. 28,1958; Cadiz vs. Nicolas, G. R. No. 
L-9198, Feb. 13, 1958). The result is that the home-stead in question must be 
returned to Manzano 's heirs, petitioners herein, <em>who are, in turn, bound to 
restore to appellee Ocampo the sum of P3,000.00 received by Manzano asthe price 
thereof</em> (Medel vs. Eliazo, G. R. No.L-12617, Aug. 27, 1959; Santander vs. 
Villanueva, supra; Felices vs. Iriola, G.R. No.L-11269, Feb. 28, 1958). The 
fruits of the land should equitably compensate the interest on the price. </p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is reversed and another one entered 
declaring null and void the sale of the homestead in question to appellee Rufino 
Ocampo. The Register of Deeds for the Province of Nueva Ecija is hereby ordered 
to cancel appellee Ocampo's Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15584, and reissue 
to the heirs of the deceased Victoriano Manzano the title to the homestead in 
question. <em>Petitioners are, however, ordered to return to appellee Ocampo the 
amount of P3,000.00 received by their predecessor Victoriano Manzano as the 
price of said homestead</em>. No costs." (Italics ours.) </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the doctrine laid down in the Labrador and the Castro cases 
must be deemed revoked. Indeed, performance of the obligation of the Bajes to 
restore the possession of the lots in dispute to the heirs of the deceased 
Marcelo Valdez cannot be demanded by the latter unless they, in turn, comply 
with their reciprocal obligation to refund the price paid by the Bajes. Hence, 
the first assignment of error is well taken. </p>
<p>Under the second assignment of error, the Bajes maintain that they are 
entitled to reimbursement of the cost the improvements allegedly introduced by 
them in good faith and to retain the land in question until such reimbursement 
shall have been made. The record does not satisfactorily show, however, the 
existence of any such improvements. What is more, the court of first instance 
found - and the Court of Appeals has not disturbed this finding - that the 
expenses allegedly incurred by the Bajes in connection with the lots in 
litigation were not necessary for the preservation thereof and did not 
constitute improvements, but were mere expenses of production the reimbursement 
of which may not be demanded by the Bajes, they having been compensated therefor 
by the products of said lots harvested by them. The second assignment of error 
is, therefore, untenable. </p>
<p>In short, the sale made by the deceased Marcelo Valdez to herein petitioners 
Generoso Baje and Saturnina Sacdalan is null and void <em>ab initio</em>, for 
which reason the respondents herein, as heirs and successors in interest of 
Marcelo Valdez are the owners of the lots aforementioned, and, hence, entitled 
to the possession thereof upon reimbursement to the Bajes of the sum of P3,734 
paid by them to the deceased. Thereafter, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
2213, in the name of herein petitioners, shall be cancelled and another one 
issued in the name of respondents herein. </p>
<p>Inasmuch as the latter have no right to the pos- session of the lots in 
question until after the reimbursement above referred to shall have taken place, 
and they have neither judicially consigned said sum of P3,734, nor offered to 
make such reimbursement, the Bajes are not bound to pay to herein respondents 
the damages awarded in the decision of the Court of Appeals, except those that 
may be caused from and after the refund of said sum of P3,734.00.</p>
<p>With this modification, said decision is hereby affirmed, without special 
pronouncement as to costs. It is so ordered. </p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla,
