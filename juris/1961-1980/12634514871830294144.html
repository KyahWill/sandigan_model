				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners seek the reconsideration of the resolution of this
Court of September 28, 1967, denying their petition for review on certiorari of
a decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
further legal arguments are adduced in support of their petition, their plea
for reconsideration being buttressed on the claim that such a denial "has
deprived them of their only chance to find redress from the errors of law
committed" not only by the trial court but by the Court of Appeals, which
errors of law, in their opinion, "are substantial and deserve the
consideration of [<span style="">this Court] which is
the court of last </span>resort."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The claim is further made that the questions raised by them are
"substantial" in character, their right to property of which they <span style="">were </span>deprived without due process of <span style="">law being invoked, an infringement thereof
being unavoidable "unless [this </span>Court] comes to their aid."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There is the further assertion that their petition finds support in "law
and jurisprudence which cannot just be brushed aside <span style="">as </span>in­consequential."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
They maintain that justice "cannot be <span style="">served by simply denying their petition without so much as stating the
reason why the same was denied."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was no need to
state the reasons for denial <span style="">as a </span>careful
perusal of their petition as well <span style="">as </span>the
decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed in the case indicate
quite unmistakably </span>that the questions raised were factual in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">first </span>error of law assigned, <span style="">while apparently couched in terms that would attach to it the character </span>of
<span style="">a </span>legal question, namely, that
respondent Court of Appeals should not have sustained a declaration of default
made by the lower court in violation of their consti­tutional rights to due
process, cannot be viewed in isolation but must be correlated to the facts as
found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What are those <span style="">facts? According to the decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In support of the alleged error, defendants-appellants
maintain that they did not receive the summons issued by the trial court, and
their filing <span style="">a
</span><span style="">motion </span>to dismiss the
second cause of action constituted as a voluntary appearance only for the
second cause of action but not for the first cause of ac­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the order of default dated <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="1">January <span style="">12, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, and the resulting judgment against them would
have no force and effect for being null and void, the trial court </span>not
having acquired jurisdiction over their persons in accordance with Rule 16,
Sec. 1 (a), new Rules of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“</span><span style="">It i<span style="">s</span> </span>Our opinion that when the
lawyer of the defendants-appellants filed the motion to dismiss the second
cause of action, We can presume <span style="">that </span><span style="">they received the
summons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if they failed to receive
the summons, </span>if the party appeared generally <span style="">in a </span>case <span style="">and </span>not
by <span style="">a </span>special
appearance for the exclusive purpose of questioning the jurisdiction of the
trial<span style=""> </span><span style="">court, they submit themselves to the
jurisdiction of </span><span style="">the trial </span>court,
and they cannot now claim <span style="">before </span><span style="">this Court for the
first time that they have never submitted </span><span style="">to </span>its jurisdiction, especially so, after the s<span style="">aid </span><span style="">Court </span>dismissed the second cause of
action <span style="">in </span>the
complaint of <span style="">plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all,
the </span><span style="">trial
</span><span style="">c</span><span style="">ourt permitted them to present evidence
during the trial, represented </span>by Atty. <span style="">Rexes V. <span class="SpellE">Alejano</span>,
thus giving the defendants-appellants their day in court."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second alleged </span>error
assigned, namely, <span style="">the insufficiency of
evidence </span>presented by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Alejano</span>, Jr. to show that the real estate mortgage to be
foreclosed was without valid consideration and in violation of the Usury Law,
is on its face a question inherently factual.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would appear therefore that a more careful scrutiny on the part of
petitioners as to the nature of the petition presented ought to have given rise
to a more realistic appraisal of the chances of its being given due course by
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then perhaps no undue
disappointment would have been caused by their petition being denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since no new </span>matter
invested with legal significance is found in this motion for reconsideration,
the resolution of <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1967</st1:date>
should stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not inappropriate to
remind petitioners that an attempt to dress essentially factual matters in the
habiliments of legal terminology is not likely to meet with success.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion for reconsideration is denied.</p>
