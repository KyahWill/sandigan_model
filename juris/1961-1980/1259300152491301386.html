				<BR><BR><div align=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><p>On September 29, 1959 Diosdada Sabino, a widow, filed a complaint for 
forcible entry and detainer in the Justice of the Peace Court of Albuera, Leyte 
against Conrado Cuba, her first cousin, alleging, among others, that on May 25, 
1959 defendant, through force, intimidation, threat and stealth, dispossessed 
her of one-third of a parcel of land owned by her which contains an area of 
2.9500 hectares.</p>
<p>The property allegedly owned by plaintiff is the same property declared for 
taxation purposes in the name of Floro Sabino, her father, under Tax Declaration 
No. 2960, with the following boundaries: North—Clemente Lunzaga; East—Eulalio 
Velarde; South—Matilog River; West—Lucia Sabino.</p>
<p>After trial, the Justice of the Peace Court rendered judgment for plaintiff, 
awarding damages. Defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance at Ormoc 
City.</p>
<p>On January 13, 1960 the parties entered into an amicable settlement, signed 
by both of them and their respective counsel, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In order to buy peace and to promote the harmonious relations between the 
parties, they being relatives, they have agreed to settle this case amicably, 
with the following terms and conditions, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. That the plaintiff hereby agrees to pay the sum of Two Hundred and Fifty 
Pesos (P250.00), payable in one month from date hereof, to the defendant;</p>
<p>"2. That the defendant hereafter recognizes the absolute ownership and 
possession of the plaintifi over the entire property described under Tax 
Declaration No. 2960 of Albuera, Leyte, including the portion subject of this 
litigation; and that defendant therefore agrees further to restore unto the 
possession by the plaintiff the property complained of by plaintiff in this 
case, upon receipt of the aforesaid amount, and thereafter the plaintiff shall 
enjoy the fruits thereof including the right to harvest the rice now planted by 
him and appropriate the same;</p>
<p>"3. That hereafter defendant further warrants to defend plaintiff's title 
over the said entire property declared under Tax Declaration No. 2960 against 
any claim whatever by third parties or his 
privies."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Said agreement was submitted to the court for approval.</p>
<p>Thereafter, on January 13, 1960, the Court of First Instance rendered the 
following judgment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, decision is hereby rendered in accordance with the foregoing 
amicable settlement without pronouncement as to costs, with notice to the 
plaintiff and the defendant as well as Attys. Barte and Aguipo in open 
court."</p></blockquote>
<p>The stipulated amount of P250.00 was paid by plaintiff to defendant who in 
turn delivered the fruits of the land in litigation to the former, after some 
delay.</p>
<p>On May 20, 1960 defendant filed a motion praying for the modification of the 
judgment. He therein alleged that on the strength of the judgment plaintiff and 
some companions demanded from him on May 19, 1960 the surrender of possession 
over a portion of the property declared under Tax Declaration No. 2960 although 
said portion is not included in the land originally involved in the complaint 
for forcible entry and detainer filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of 
Albuera; that he has been in possession of said portion since 1948 when it was 
adjudicated to him by the municipal mayor of Albuera and the "barrio lieutenant 
of Damula-an; and that it was only on May 19, 1960 when he came to know that 
said portion forms part of the property declared under Tax Declaration No. 2960. 
</p>
<p>Acting on the above motion, the court issued on June 24, 1960 the following 
order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the purpose of determining the claims of the parties, Mr. Manuel Cantiga 
is hereby commissioned to make an ocular inspection of the land in question in 
order to determine the boundaries as well as the area, emphasizing in his report 
the claim of the parties, with notice to Attorneys Barte and Aguipo in open 
court."</p></blockquote>
<p>The commissioner made his ocular inspection on July 16, 1960 and on November 
10, 1960 he submitted his report, the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x When I arrived at the meeting place I and Conrado Cuba immediately 
started inspecting the lots in litigation to determine the boundaries as well as 
the area. For the purpose of this I made a sketch of the entire area of the land 
under Tax Declaration No. 2960. Said sketch is hereto attached, marked "A1 and 
made an integral part of the report. The Commissioner noted that the boundaries 
of the land under Tax. Decl. No. 2960 are different on ocular inspection from 
that as described by plaintiff in her complaint, because the actual boundaries 
are as follows: </p>

<p>"From the sketch marked 'A' there is a portion marked 'B'.</p>
<p>"This is the 'portion in litigation. The boundaries of which are as 
follows:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<p>"This is the subject of the amicable settlement dated Jan. 13, 1960. This is 
the same area possessed by defendant and claimed by the plaintiff the only 
subject of litigation and the only subject of the amicable settlement.</p>
<p>"The portion marked 'C' was not a subject of this litigation and this portion 
was possessed by defendant Conrado Cuba, the area of which is 12,312 sq. m. more 
or less. The boundaries of which are as follows:</p>
<p>North—B. Prieto<br>East—Land in litigation<br>South—Diosdada 
Sabino<br>West—Provincial Road.</p>
<p>"The plaintiff after the amicable settlement took the portion marked 'C' from 
defendant Conrado Cuba using the amicable settlement as the weapon according to 
the defendant CONRADO CUBA.</p>
<p>"The persons present during the ocular inspection were:</p>
<p>1. Diosdado Cuba<br>2. Ildefonso Sabino and<br>3. Cresencio Sta. Iglesia 
(policeman)"</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 22, 1960 the court approved the commissioner's report.</p>
<p>On January 8, 1961 plaintiff moved for the reconsideration of the approval of 
the commissioner's report on the ground that the same did not reflect faithfully 
the facts relating to the land covered by Tax Declaration No. 296O; and that the 
court had no jurisdiction to alter its decision after it has become final. On 
January 18, 1961 this motion for reconsideration was denied. Hence, plaintiff 
has appealed directly to this Court on questions purely of law.</p>
<p>In issue is the jurisdiction of the court <i>a quo</i> to reopen the case 
after its judgment became final and had been executed.</p>
<p>Defendant-appellee maintains that the case may be reopened with a view to 
modifying the Judgment in question, even after execution, for the same, being 
one based on a compromise, did not have tne effect of a final judgment as to 
constitute <em>res judicata</em>. He cited and relies on the case of Saminiada 
<em>v</em>. Mata, 92 Phil. 427. The ruling in said case however has no 
application here for the reason that there the judgment in controversy "was 
merely an interlocutory order because something had yet to be done, i.e., the 
segregation agreed upon, which together with the court's approval, will be the 
ones to give it finality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>Defendant-appellee's theory runs counter to Article 2037 of the Civil Code 
which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Article 2037. A compromise has upon the parties the effect and authority of 
res judicata; but there shall be no execution except in compliance with a 
judicial compromise."</p></blockquote>
<p>The rule is well settled that a judgment upon a compromise has the force of 
res judicata between the parties, and cannot, and should not, be disturbed 
except for vices of consent or forgery, it being the obvious purpose of such 
compromise to settle, once and for all, the issues involved and bar factual 
disputes and controversies thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As 
aptly stated by this Court through Chief Justice Cesar Bengzon, a judgment upon 
a compromise is— </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x in the nature of a contract and is in effect an admission by the 
parties that the judgment is a just determination of their rights on the facts 
of the case, had they been proved. Even more than a contract (which may be 
enforced oy ordinary action for specific performance), the compromise agreement 
is part and parcel of the judgment, and may, therefore, be enforced as such by a 
writ of execution. In fact, a compromise has upon the parties the eiTect and 
authority of <em>res judlcata</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>It has all the force and effect of any other judgment and is conclusive upon 
the parties and their privies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>Defendant-appellee would want to set aside the judgment in question on the 
ground of mistake in that he was not aware that the land in his possession since 
1948 was part and parcel of the property covered by Tax Declaration No. 
2960.</p>
<p>The circumstances obtaining in this case, however, would bar him from seeking 
the re-opening of the case on the ground of mistake. The amicable settlement, 
where he recognized the ownership and possession of plaintiff Sabino <i>not only 
over the portion involved in the forcible entry and detainer case but also over 
the entire property</i> described in Tax Declaration No. 2960, was signed by him 
as well as by his counsel. Hence, it cannot be said that he did not know the 
contents and extent of said agreement. Furthermore, the records show that as 
early as February 16, 1960 defendant Cuba petitioned for a writ of execution 
against plaintiff Sabino for the payment of the amount of P250.00 due him 
pursuant to the judgment. Said amount was paid to him and later, after 
delivering to plaintiff the fruits of the land, defendant Cuba manifested in 
open court that he would not disturb plaintiff Sabino's possession over the 
property in question. In other words, he has induced the poor widow to rely on 
his solemn pledge to recognize her dominion over the entire property described 
in Tax Declaration No. 2960, collected and received from her the stipulated 
amount of P250.00 and, when plaintiff Sabino demanded of him to comply with his 
prestation under the compromise agreement as approved by the court, he refused 
to do so and conveniently asked for the modification of the judgment, alleging 
mistake in entering into said compromise. Defendant-appellee is estopped from 
questioning the terms of the compromise agreement after having received the 
P250.00 which, as to him, constituted part of the consideration of said 
agreement.</p>
<p>Appellee Cuba asserts that in the complaint for forcible entry and detainer 
(par. 3) appellant claims only an area of 2.9500 hectares, whereas the 
commissioner subsequently allegedly found that the property under Tax 
Declaration No. 2960 contains an area of 6.0017 hectares. The implication is 
that appellant is entitled to ownership and possession over only 2.9500 
hectares, and not more. Suffice it to state that in the same complaint (par. 2) 
she also stated the boundaries of the property in question. And in case of 
discrepancy between the area and the boundaries, the latter prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p>The judgment in question<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> is final 
and has been fully executed in respect to plaintiff Sabino's obligation 
thereunder. To modify it for the purpose of avoiding its enforcement against the 
defendant is beyond the jurisdiction of the lower court. The jurisdiction of the 
court over a given case after its judgment has become final and executory lies 
in the enforcement of such judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p>Summing up, viewed under the principle of a binding contract, the doctrine of 
estoppel and the provisions of law concerning finality of judgment, 
defendant-appellee Cuba can no longer seek the amendment of the judgment. </p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order dated June 24, 1960 appointing a commissioner to 
conduct an ocular inspection of the property in question; the order dated 
December 22, i960 approving the commissioner's report; and, the order dated 
January 18, 1961 denying the motion to reconsider the order of December 22, 
1960, are hereby set aside. No costs. </p>
