				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First In­stance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> in three
interrelated cases, which were jointly tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. Nos. L-17215 and L-17216 (Criminal Cases No. 798 and 800
of said court) appellants <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> were respectively
convicted of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunitions, and each
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from five (5) to
seven (7) years and to pay the <span style="">corresponding costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. L-17217 (Criminal Case No. 802 of the same court),
said ap­pellants Santos and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, as well as
appellants Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sing­gup</span> <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span>, were
convicted of three murders, qualified by treachery, with the generic
aggravating circumstances of evident pre­meditation, commission of the offense
in an inhabited place, with the use of unlicensed firearms, and by a band,
without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, and sentenced as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Santos, as leader and
mastermind, to the extreme penalty "for each of the deaths of <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>;" (b) <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, as ignorant
followers of Catalina Santos, to suf­fer each three (3) life imprisonments,
with the corresponding accessory penalties; and (c) <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span>,
as a minor and ignorant follower of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos,
to an indeterminate penalty ranging from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>mayor</u> to seventeen (17) years
and four (4) months of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>temporal</u>, "for each death
of the said <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>," with the corresponding
accessory penalties, in addition to the four (4) appellants indemnifying,
jointly and severally, the heirs of each one of said deceased persons in the
sum of P6,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to
pay the costs proportionately.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, likewise, ordered one-half of the preventive
imprisonment respectively suffered by appellants to be credited to them, as
well as the confiscation of the firearms, <span class="SpellE">boloes</span> and
ammunitions used in the commission of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main facts are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> and his sons,
<span class="SpellE">Ray­mundo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>,
were walking, in single file, on the trail along the river bank of <span class="SpellE">Sagat</span> Creek, headed for the <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Dinatay</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, on March 12,
1958, at about 2:00 <span style="">p.m., </span>they were shot by several persons who <span style="">laid in wait, in foxholes, several feet
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>
were </span>felled by the bullets, <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> retreated
and took cover behind some stone boulders, protected by a screen of tall grasses,
locally known as "<span class="SpellE">talahib</span>," and trees, some
distance away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the ambushers
had jumped out of their foxholes and beheaded their victims, as well as hacked
their bodies and dismembered one of them, after which they went away, going
upstream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>
left his hiding place and, taking the opposite direction, proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Guinalbin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>, where he
reported the occurrence to <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> Ruiz, the chief of
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, in turn, relayed the
news to the local PC detachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­upon,
PC Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Bulanos</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>,
leading a posse, proceeded, on foot, to the scene of the crime - which they
reached at about 2:00 a.m. - picked up the remains of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Fontanillas</span></span><span style=""> </span>and brought them to the municipal
building, where the justice of the peace held, in the morning of March 13, an
inquest, in the course of which <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> re­vealed
that the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> had been killed by <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> was brought to the
place, near the municipal building, where all <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>
found nearby had, meanwhile, been round­ed up and kept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> readily
identified, from among them, herein appellants, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
Santos (<u>alias</u> <span class="SpellE">Lino</span>), <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Singgup</span> <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span>, apart from one
<span class="SpellE">Obdiy-ya</span> <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>, as the
cul­prits, who, accordingly, were detained and investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same day, a complaint for multiple
murder was filed against them with the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Agalipay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three (3)
days later, complaints for illegal possession of firearm and ammunitions were,
also, filed against <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
preliminary hearing before said court, on <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1958</st1:date>, appellants, upon being informed, by the
Justice of the Peace, who presided it, of the charges against them, pleaded
guilty to said charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, or on April 19, 1958, the provincial fiscal filed,
with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, an information for illegal possession of firearm
and ammunitions, against <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> San­tos, <u>alias</u>
<span class="SpellE">Lino</span> (Criminal Case No. 798 of said Court); another
infor­mation, for a similar offense, against <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> (Criminal Case No. 800 of said Court); and a
third information, against <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> San­tos, <u>alias</u>
<span class="SpellE">Lino</span>, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Singgup</span> <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span> and <span class="SpellE">Obdiy-ya</span> <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>, for multiple
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the prosecu­tion, <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> was, later discharged from the information in the
latter case, to be a state witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After due trial, thereafter, judgment was rendered as above
indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, these appeals by the
convicted defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue for determination is one of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. L-17217 the question is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who killed the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testifying on their own behalf, appellants
pleaded absolute innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, two
(2) <span style="">eye </span>witnesses,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>,
positively affirmed the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> declared that, as he hid himself behind some big
boulders, immediately after the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> had been
shot by their assassins, the latter emerged from the foxholes in which they
were, and turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sing­gup</span> <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span>, and state witness <span class="SpellE">Obdiy-ya</span>
<span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>; that he recognized them because they not
only came out of said foxholes, but, also, had spent some time dancing and
shouting merrily, as they beheaded the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>,
hacked their bodies, and disemboweled them, even tossing at each other the
severed heads of <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fonta­nilla</span>, aside from eventually throwing their
bodies into the stream nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY">This testimony was fully corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>,
who further testified that Santos, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> had used Japanese rifles - which he identified during
the trial as Exhibits A, B and C, and had been recovered by the authorities,
with his assistance, from a tree in the <span class="SpellE">Dibibi</span>
forest, in which said weapons were hidden - in shooting the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>;
that the latter were killed because they were going to, and working on, a land
claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>, whose leader was Santos;
that, in the afternoon of March 11, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had asked Santos, in the house of one <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caliocalio</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Calapitag</span>, to join him the next morning and help in the
cultivation of said land in <span class="SpellE">Dinatay</span>; that, in reply
Santos urged <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> to proceed directly to this
place, and gave assurances that he (Santos) and other <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>
would follow him thereto; that, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> were then, likewise, present in said house; that,
early the next morning, Santos, <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Olme­hemet</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Antolin's</span> house and invited him to go fishing, in view of
which he joined the group; that, while they were walking along the bank of <span class="SpellE">Addalam</span> River, Santos bade them to hide the fishing
equipment they carried, because they would get firearms in <span class="SpellE">Dibibi</span>
and then ambush the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>, who were g<span style="">oing </span>to work on the aforementioned
land of the <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span> in <span class="SpellE">Dinatay</span>;
that, thereupon, they proceeded to the afore­mentioned <span class="SpellE">Dibibi</span>
forest, where <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> climbed a <span class="SpellE"><u>balete</u></span>
tree and got three (3) Japanese rifles concealed therein; that, thence, they -
carry­ing said rifles, as well as <span class="SpellE">boloes</span> and a spear
- proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Sagat</span> Creek, using a trail along <span class="SpellE">Addalam</span> River; that, a short distance away from the bank of
<span class="SpellE">Sagat</span> Creek they dug seven (7) foxholes and then laid
in wait<span style="">&nbsp; </span>therein; that, when, early in
the afternoon, the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> passed in front of
them, several feet away from the foxholes, Santos fired at <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>, whereas <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>,
respectively; and that, thereafter, appellants and <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>
emerged from their foxholes and <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> the bodies of
the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> as well as beheaded the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing direct evidence for the prosecution was cor­roborated
by the following:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. When, accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>, peace
officers proceeded to the scene of the crime to recover said bodies of the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>, they found, inside the foxholes above mentioned,
personal belongings (marked as Exhibits I to I-13, J to J-15 and K to <span style="">K-4) </span>which on March 13, <span style="">1958, </span>appellants admitted to be
theirs;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The prosecution introduced, also, in evidence, the confes­sions
of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos, Exhibits N and O, a confession of
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, Exhibit P, that of <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, Exhibit Q, and that of <span class="SpellE">Singgup</span>
<span class="SpellE">Olme­hemet</span>, <span style="">Exhibit
R, </span>each one of which had been subscribed and sworn to before the justice
of the peace of <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. At the preliminary hearing held before this officer, who trans­lated
the respective <span class="SpellE">informations</span> into the <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> dialect, which appellants understand and speak, the
latter entered a plea of guilty, and said officer <span style="">so </span>stated in his orders of March 25, 1958, forwarding the
records of these cases to the Court of First Instance;</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Capt. Gregorio <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Panis</span></span><span style=""> </span>of the
Constabulary testified that, upon being investigated by him, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos admitted being the owner of the Japanese
rifle Exhibit A, as well as of the spear Exhibit D and two (2) <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>, <span style="">Exhibits E
and H, </span>apart from the deer skin bag (Exhibit K), containing personal
articles <span style="">(Exhibits K to K-4), </span>found
in one of the foxholes at the scene of the crime; that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, in turn, admitted that the Japanese rifle, Exhibit
B, the bolo with its scabbard, Exhibits G and G-1, and a deer skin helmet and
deer skin bag, found in one of the afore­mentioned foxholes, are, in turn, his
own; and that appellant <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> ad­mitted that the
Japanese rifle, <span style="">Exhibit </span>C,
belongs to him and that he has no license to possess the same; that in the
course of the investigation conducted by him (<span class="SpellE">Panis</span>),
which was put in writing (Exhibit N), Santos admitted having committed the
crime charged, because the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> were clearing
and working on a land claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>, who, accord­ingly,
resented it; and that the statement contained in <span style="">Exhibit </span>N was given <span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos freely and voluntarily;</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Upon the other hand, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
Esteban, declared that <span style="">he </span>took
the confessions, Exhibits O, P, R and Y of Santos, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Boc­to</span>, <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span> and <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>, respectively; that said confessions were free­ly
and voluntarily made by the aforementioned defendants, in the dialect known and
spoken by them, and then translated into English; that said confessions <span style="">were </span>brought, unsigned, before the
justice of the peace of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aglipay</span></span><span style="">, </span>before
whom defendants subscribed their respective confessions <span style="">and swore to the </span>truths of the contents thereof, after said
justice of the peace had translated the same to them into the local dialect and
ascertain­ed <span style="">that </span>they had made
it without any compulsion whatsoever; and that appel­lants Santos, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> had, likewise,
admitted to him that they <span style="">owned the aforementioned rifles and had no license to hold the same;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">6. Rodolfo G. <span class="SpellE">Hermoso</span>, the justice of
the peace of <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>, con­firmed the foregoing
evidence regarding the verification of defendants' confessions Exhibits N, O,
P, Q, R and Y and the fact that they enter­ed a plea of guilty at the
preliminary hearing held before him on <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="3">March
 25, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants maintain that the lower court had erred in allowing <span class="SpellE">An­tolin</span> to be discharged to be a witness for the
prosecution, and in giving credence to his testimony as such, despite his
subsequent recantation and testimony for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first part of this pretense is based upon
the fact that <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> had witnessed the occurrence
from which de­fense counsel deduces that there was no "absolute necessity
for the tes­timony of the defendant whose discharge" was requested by the
prosecu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fallacy of this
argument is apparent from the fact that appel­lants' counsel assails the
sufficiency of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span> <u>and</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Antolin</u></span>, to justify the appealed decision, despite
the other evidence corroborating said testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>
could not possibly have testified on the motive of the assassins, an important
element that <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> could and did supply, apart from
the circumstance that his <span style="">co­operation </span>made it possible for the prosecution to locate the
firearms used in the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the lower court was justified in discharging <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> from the information in the case for multiple
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the credibility of his testimony as a state witness,
suf­fice it to say that its veracity has been amply established, not only because
it was substantially corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Simanero's</span>
testimony, but, also, by the fact that the firearms used by appellants were
recovered through the assistance of <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>, that
personal effects belonging to appellants were found in the foxholes at the scene
of the occurrence, and that the other evidence on record bear out the
aforementioned testimony of <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, testifying subsequently for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> claimed to know nothing about the circumstances
under which the <span class="SpellE">Fon­tanillas</span> had been killed, because
he was then, he claimed, in his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, however, the decision appealed from has the follow­ing
to say:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Altho</span> <span class="SpellE">Obdiy-ya</span> <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>, as a defense wit­ness, tried to repudiate his
testimony as a State witness, by stating that he did not know who ambushed and
killed the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> and that the facts testified
to by him as a State witness were taught to him by Sgt. Esteban of the 120th PC
Company, this Court can not believe this testimony of <span class="SpellE">Obdiy-ya</span>
<span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>, as a defense witness, not only because of
his manner in so testifying, - very hesitant, with bowed head towards the <span style="">floor as </span>if he could not squarely face
the Court, under heavy strain and wary, - which was a direct contrast from his
manner when he testified for the State, - alert, quick and confident, - but
also because the essential details of his testimony as a State witness could
not have been taught to him by Sgt. Esteban.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Antolin's</span> revelations to Capt. <span class="SpellE">Panis</span> led to the recovery of the firearms used by the
accused in the ambuscade from the hiding place in <span class="SpellE">Dibibi</span>
forest and to the quick solution of the mystery of the ambus­cade of the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Besides, </span>the essential de­tails of <span class="SpellE">Antolin's</span> testimony as a State witness and of the lone
survivor (<span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>) as regards the ambush and the
individual participation of the accused are sustained by the respective
confessions of <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span style="">Santos (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'N' </span>and ‘O’<span style="">), </span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'P'), <span class="SpellE">Tabbegat</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span> <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'Q'), </span>and <span class="SpellE">Singgup</span> <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span> (Ex. ‘R’), wherein they admitted their individual
participation in the ambuscade, and stated the motive - the clearing and
working of the land in <span class="SpellE">Dinatay</span> by the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>, which are claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>
to be theirs, and the tribal belief <span style="">or </span>tradition
'<span class="SpellE">ponyang</span>' (killing of people to cure sick <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, we are not justified in disturbing the
conclusion thus reached by His Honor the trial Judge, who was in a better
position than we are to pass upon the veracity of the witnesses in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants, likewise, impugn the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>
as biased and prejudiced, because he is related to the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span>
and his testimony is "clearly motivated by hatred," in the language
of de­fense counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted,
that this alleged hatred is attributed, not to any personal animosity towards
appellants, but to <span class="SpellE">Simanero's</span> con­suming desire to
punish the murderers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This suggests,
however, his earnest conviction that appellants herein are the true culprits,
for, otherwise, instead of satisfying said desire, his testimony would de­feat
it by promoting the conviction of innocent parties, thus, in effect,
exonerating the guilty ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the indications are to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>
had really witnessed the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, upon being investigated the next day, <span class="SpellE">Simanero</span>
stated positively that the <span class="SpellE">Fontanillas</span> had been
killed by <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>, whom he could identify if he saw
them again, and, when, immediately there­after, he was brought to the place
where <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span> had been rounded <span style="">up, he unhesitatingly singled out herein
appellants and <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> as <span style="">the culprits, and they, in turn, admitted their guilt.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants would have us
believe </span>that their confessions had been secured through duress, but, the
testimony of the Justice of the Peace before whom said confessions were
subscribed and sworn to, the firm hands with which<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
they had apparently subscribed said confessions, and the <span style="">many details </span>set forth therein,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">which could have been supplied by no
other person than appellants themselves,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> leave no room for doubt as to the absence of
said duress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent from the foregoing that the lower court has not
err­ed in finding appellants herein guilty of multiple murder, as charged in
the information in G.R. No. L-17217.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the penalty meted out to them is in accordance with law, the
number of votes necessary to sanction the ex­treme penalty imposed upon <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Santos is lacking, he having committ­ed the
offense to forestall, he believed, a usurpation of rights he felt mo­rally
bound to defend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
was regarded as a leader of the <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span>, for he had
had some schooling, and was, at one time, a public officer, although he had not
gone beyond the elementary education.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pre­cisely, because of the limited nature of his schooling and of the
effect, upon <span style="">his general </span>outlook,
of the unenlightened environment prevailing in the community of <span class="SpellE">Ilongots</span> to which he <span style="">belongs, as well </span>as of the circum­stance that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> had been a
former municipal mayor, whose act in clearing and working on a land claimed by
the <span class="SpellE">llongots</span> was <span style="">seemingly regarded </span>by these non-Christians as one of oppression
and abuse of authority, the Court feels that Santos should not <span style="">be dealt with the </span>severity due to
persons otherwise circumstanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the penalties imposed upon him should be reduced to three (3) life imprison­ments,
subject to the limitations prescribed in Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to cases G.R. Nos. L-17215 and L-17216, it is clear
that the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, corroborated by the
con­fessions above referred to and the other circumstances already adverted <span style="">to, deserves more credence </span>and has
much more weight than the absolute­ly uncorroborated testimony of appellants
Santos and <span class="SpellE">Bocto</span>, who, like their codefendants, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Olmehemet</span>, have
limited themselves to merely denying the acts imputed to them by the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Modified as regards the penalties for <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
Santos in G.R. No. L-17217, which are hereby reduced to three (3) life
imprisonments, the decision <span style="">appealed
from is, accordingly, affirmed </span>in all other respects, with costs against
the appellants.</p>
