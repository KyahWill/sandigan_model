of fear or threats; or it was procured by undue and improper <span style="">pressure </span>and influence on the part of
the main beneficiaries and of person or persons in collusion with them, or the
signature of the testator was secured by or thru fraud; (c) that the will was
not executed according to the formal requirements of the law; and (d) that the
alleged will subject of probate contravened the Extrajudicial Partition of 1949
agreed upon by him, his deceased spouse, <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>, and all his children, Francisca, Pablo, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> and Fernando thru his judicial guardian <span class="SpellE">Clotilde</span> Samson, and also contravened Don Jesus' own
probated holographic will and codicil of 1955 and 1956, respectively, essentially
confirming and implementing the said partition of 1949 which had already been
partially executed by all the signatories thereto in the partition of the
estate of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> in
December, 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of Francisca's designation as executrix in the new
will dated <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1959</st1:date>,
the Probate Court appointed her <span class="SpellE">Administratrix</span> of the
estate of her late father, Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then filed with the Probate Court an
inventory of the properties of the estate which, according to the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> therein (the private respondents now) did not
include some properties appearing in the agreement of November 25, 1949 or in
the inventory attached thereto as Annex "A" and in the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Particion</span>" of
December 19, 1959 as belonging to or should pertain to Don Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
these properties consist of thirty-three (33) premium agricultural lots with a
total land area of 1,187,970 square meters, or approximately 119 hectares and
with a total assessed value of P48,410.00 or a probable total market value of
P238,000.00 at only P2,000.00 per hectare, and four (4) commercial urban lots
ideally located in the business section of <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span>
City including the lot and the building presently occupied by the well-known
"<span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> Hotel" with an assessed value of
approximately P117,260.00 or a probable market value at the time of
P469,040.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appearing from the new
will that these properties were bequeathed to Pablo <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>
and Francisca <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>-Betts, specifically, 3 parcels of
the 33 agricultural lands to Pablo and the rest to Francisca, the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> also raised in issue the non-inclusion of said
properties in the inventory of the estate of their late father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In answer, Francisca claimed ownership over
the same, alleging that she bought the properties from their father and
presenting the two Deeds of Sale now being assailed, one dated August 26, 1961
purporting to show the sale of the 33 parcels of agricultural land to Francisca
by their father for the price of P70,000.00 and the other dated November 26,
1962 evidencing the sale of the four urban lots for the sum of P80,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claiming fraud in the sales, the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> filed Civil Case No. 3068, seeking the annulment
of the aforesaid two deeds of sale, with damages, which upon agreement of the
parties was then jointly heard and tried with Special Proceedings No. 699 for
probate of the last Will and Testament of Don Jesus executed on <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a joint hearing of the merits of these two cases, the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> promulgated a decision on <st1:date year="1973" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1973</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which states:</p>

<p class="NUM"><b><span style="">I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></b>The respondent Court of Appeals

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the first issue of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> raised in the assignment of errors, We hold that
the same is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The controversy
as to the competency or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> of Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> to execute his will cannot be determined by acts of
the herein private respondents as <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to the
will in formally agreeing in writing jointly with the petitioner Francisca <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> de Betts that their father, Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>, be appointed by the court executor of the will of

subsequently petitioning the court not to require Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>
to file any accounting as executor in the proceedings, which petitioners claim
and was upheld by the trial court as constituting <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
on the part of the private respondents from questioning the competence of Don
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is not applicable in probate proceedings, a ruling
laid down in the case of </span><u>Testate Estate of the Late <span class="SpellE">Procopia</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Benedicta</u></span><u>

an eminent and recognized authority on Civil Law when he was still in the Court
of Appeals, and We quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Finally, probate proceedings involve public interest, and the
application therein of the rule of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, when it
will block the ascertainment of the truth as to the circumstances surrounding
the execution of a testament, would seem inimical to public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over and above the interest of private
parties is that of the state to see that testamentary dispositions be carried
out if, and only if, executed conformably to law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court of New York aptly said in Re Canfield's Will, 300
N.Y.S., 502:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The primary purpose of the proceeding is not to establish the existence
of the right of any living person, but to determine whether or not the decedent
has performed the acts specified by the pertinent statutes, which are the
essential pre-requisites to personal direction of the mode of devolution of his
property on death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no legal but
merely a moral duty resting upon a proponent to attempt to validate the wishes
of the departed, and he may and frequently does receive no personal benefit
from the performance of the act.</p>

<p class="2Q">One of the most fundamental conceptions of probate law, is that it
is the duty of the court to effectuate, in so far as may be compatible with the
public interest, the devolutionary wishes of a deceased person (Matter of
Watson's Will, 262 N.Y., 284, 186, N.E., 787; Matter of <span class="SpellE">Marriman's</span>

<p class="BODY">The next issue that commands Our attention is whether the
respondent court erred in not allowing the probate of the last will and
testament of Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners claim that the disallowance was
based on speculations, surmises or conjectures, disregarding the facts as found
by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Code is
very clear and explicit in providing the cases where a will may be disallowed
under Article 839 which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 839.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The will
shall be disallowed in any of the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the formalities required by law have not
been complied with;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the testator was insane, or otherwise
mentally incapable of making a will, at the time of its execution;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was executed through force or under <span class="SpellE">duresss</span>, or the influence of fear, or threats;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was procured by undue and improper
pressure and influence, on the part of the beneficiary or of some other person;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the signature of the testator was procured
by fraud;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the testator acted by mistake or did not
intend that the instrument he signed should be his will at the time of affixing
his signature thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue under consideration appears to Us to have been answered
by the respondent court itself when it accepted the findings of the trial court
on the due execution of the questioned will and testament of Don Jesus,
declaring:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and
going back to the previous question, whether the questioned will and testament
of <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1959</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, was executed in accordance with Arts. 805-809 of
the New Civil Code, - this Tribunal from the very beginning accepts the
findings of the inferior court concerning the question, ?</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">On <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1959</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> died at <span class="SpellE">Ligao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2 weeks after said death of his wife,
Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> decided to make a new will, thereby
revoking and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> his previous holographic will
which he made on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1955</st1:date>
and also its codicil dated <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="8"><span style="">August </span>14, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the presence of his bookkeeper and
secretary, Esteban P. Ramirez, he crossed out in ink each and every page of
said page he wrote on each page the word "<span class="SpellE">cancelado</span>",
and affixed his signature thereon (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. V-5, V-6,
consecutively up to and including <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. V-14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then instructed Ramirez to make a list of
all his properties with their corresponding descriptions.</p>

<p class="2Q">Meanwhile, Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> sent for his
lawyer, Don Gregorio Imperial, Sr. and the latter came accompanied by his son,
Atty. Jorge S. Imperial, who, incidentally, is now a judge of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don Jesus informed his lawyers that he wanted
to make a new will, and accordingly gave more de­tailed instructions as to how
he wanted to divide his properties among his four children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He handed to them a list and on the left he
indicated the name of the child to whom the listed properties shall
pertain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Jorge Imperial took notes
of the instructions of Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To Don Jesus, Spanish is his major language,
as in fact his conversations with Don Gregorio are always in Spanish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days before <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1959</st1:date>, Atty. Jorge S. Imperial
showed to Don Jesus the semi-final draft of the will and after reading it Don
Jesus said that it was as directed by him, and after making a few minor
corrections, he instructed Atty. Jorge S. Imperial to put the will in final
form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further told Atty. Jorge
Imperial that the signing of the will should be at his home in <span class="SpellE">Ligao</span>, in the morning of November 14, 1959, and that the
witnesses should be Mr. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Balana</span>, the then Register
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>; Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span>
who is a friend of the family; and Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Gaya</span> who
is a sort of employee of Don Jesus.</p>

<p class="2Q">Thus in the morning of November 14, 1959, Don Gregorio <span style="">and </span>Atty. Jorge S. Imperial, riding in
a sedan, stopped at the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> residence of Mr.
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Balana</span>, and informed the latter that Don Jesus
was requesting him to be one of the attesting witnesses to his will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Balana</span>, having
a very high regard for Don Jesus, considered it an honor to be so asked, and
gladly went with the Imperials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
arrived at the residence of Don Jesus at <span class="SpellE">Ligao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, almost <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time>
of that morning, and they were ushered in by Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Gaya</span>,
and the latter requested them to be seated at the usual receiving room on the
ground floor while he announced their arrival to Don Jesus who was on the
second floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon Don Jesus came down,
carrying with him the will to be signed placed inside a <span class="SpellE">cartolina</span>
folder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He greeted Don Gregorio, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Balana</span>, and Atty. Imperial and immediately joined them in
conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Gaya</span>
called for Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span>, whose residence is
just across the road from the house of Don Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span> was
already informed by Don Jesus himself about the fact of signing the will that
morning, and so, on being advised by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Gaya</span> that
the Imperials had already arrived, <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span>
proceeded to the residence of Don Jesus, without much delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the coming of <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span>
and the coming back of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Gaya</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
there were now six people gathered in the living room, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>,
Don Gregorio Imperial, Atty. Jorge S. Imperial, Mr. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Balana</span>,
Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span>, and Mr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Gaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the witnesses who testified for the
petitioner declared that Don Jesus was in bright and lively conversation which
ran from problems of farming and the merits of French-made <span style="">wines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>At 11:00 o'clock, Don Gregorio made a remark that it is about
time to do what they were there for, and this was followed by a more or less
statement from Jesus, who said:</p>

<p class="2Q">On request of Don Jesus, all of them moved to the big round table

<p class="BODY">This cited portion of the appealed decision accepts as a fact
that the findings of the lower court declaring the contested will as having
been executed with all the formal requirements of a valid will, are supported
by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding is conclusive
upon this Tribunal and We cannot alter, review or revise the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no further need for Us to
dwell on the matter as both the lower court and the respondent appel­late court
have declared that these are the facts and such facts are fully borne and
supported by the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no
error in the conclusion arrived at that the contested will was duly executed in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule that the
questioned last will and testament of Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>
fully complied with the formal requirements of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court, however, denied probate of the will after
"noting certain details which were a little bit difficult to reconcile
with the ordinary course of things and of <span style="">life."
</span>First was the fact that the spouses Don Jesus and <span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> together with their four children Francisca,
Pablo, <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> and Fernando had executed the
Extrajudicial Partition of <st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1949</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) which divided the
conjugal properties of the spouses between the spouses themselves and the
children under the terms and conditions and dispositions herein-before stated
and to implement its provisions, Don Jesus and <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> subsequently executed separately their respective
holographic wills both dated January 5, 1955 and codicils dated August 14, 1956
with the same terms and conditions as reproduced herein earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both holographic wills and codicils having
been probated thereafter and upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>, Don Jesus was appointed executor of the will and in
due time the partition of the properties or estate of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> was approved by the probate court on <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court ruled that the Extrajudicial Partition of
November 25, 1949 was an enforceable contract which was binding on Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> as the surviving spouse, barring him from violating
said partition agreement, barring him from revoking his holographic will of
January 5, 1955 and his codicil of August 14, 1956, and further barring him
from executing his new will and testament of November 14, 1959, now the subject
of the probate proceedings elevated to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with this ruling of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the Extrajudicial Partition of <st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1949</st1:date> is null and void
under Article 1056 in relation to Article 1271 of the old Civil Code which are
applicable hereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These Articles
provide as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1056.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
testator should make a partition of his property by an act inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>, or by will, such partition shall stand in so far as
it does not prejudice the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the forced
heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 1271.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All things,
even future ones, which are not excluded from the commerce of man, may be the
subject-matter of contracts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nevertheless, no contract may be entered into with respect to
future inheritances, except those the object of which is to make a division
inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> of an estate, in accordance with Article
1056.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All services not contrary to law or to good morals may also be the
subject-matter of contract."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1056 specifically uses the word "testator" from
which the clear intent of the law may be deduced that the privilege of
partitioning one's estate by acts inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> is
restricted only to one who has made a prior will or testament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Article 1056 being an
exception cannot be given a wider scope as to include in the exception any
person whether he has made a will or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court citing the same Article concluded that under
both the old and new Civil Code, a person who executes a will is permitted at
the same time or a little thereafter or even before as long as he mentions this
fact in the will, to partition his properties pursuant to the provisions of
Article 1056 of the old Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court further added that jurisprudence is to the effect that the partition
presupposes the execution of the will that it ratifies or effectuates, citing
the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Legasto</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span></u>,
54 Phil. 776.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, respondent court
held the opinion that the extrajudicial partition of <st1:date year="1949" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1949</st1:date> was ratified in the
holographic will executed by Don Jesus on <st1:date year="1955" day="5" month="1">Jan. 5, 1955</st1:date> and in the codicil of <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1956</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, We do not agree
with this ruling of the respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Legasto</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>,
<u>supra</u>, the Supreme Court categorically declared the necessity of a prior
will before the testator can partition his properties among his heirs, and We
quote the pertinent portions of the decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The first question to decide in the instant appeal is whether
the partition made by Sabina <span class="SpellE">Almadin</span> of her property
among her nieces, the defendants and appellants herein, was valid and
enforceable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 1056 of the Civil Code provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Art. 1056.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the testator
should make a partition of his property by an act inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>,
or by will, such partition shall stand in so far as it does not prejudice the <span class="SpellE">legi­time</span> of the forced heirs.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court of Spain, in a deci­sion rendered on <st1:date year="1903" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1903</st1:date>, laid down the
following doctrine:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Considering that the language of article 1056 cannot be
interpreted to mean that a person may, by acts inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>,
partition his property referred to in the section wherein said article is
found, without the authority of a testament containing an expression of his
last will, or <span style="">the authority of law,
for, otherwise, a partition thus made would be tantamount to making a will in a
manner not provided for, authorized, nor included in the chapter referring to
testaments, and especially, to the forms thereof, which is entirely different
from the legal consequences of a free disposition made by parents during their
lifetime, whereby they give to their children the whole or a part of their
property;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'Considering that, inasmuch as the second paragraph of article 1271
makes reference to the aforesaid article, in providing that no contracts may be
entered into with respect to future inheritances except those the object of which
is to make a division inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> of the estate in
accordance with article 1056, it is evident that said difference likewise leads
to the conclusion that a partition thus made should be on the basis of a testamentary
or legal succession and should be made in conformity with the fundamental rules
thereof and the order of the heirs entitled to the estate, because neither of
the two provisions could be given a wider meaning or scope than that they
simply provide for the division of the estate during the lifetime of the owner,
which, otherwise, would have to be done upon the death of the testator in order
to carry into effect the partition of the estate among the persons interested.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>
comments on the same article as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A distinction must be made between the disposition of property and
its division; and the provision of article 1056 authorizing the testator to
dispose of his property by acts inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> or by
last will, must be understood in accordance with this distinction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea is to divide the estate among the
heirs designated by the testator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
designation constitutes the disposition of the properties to take effect after
his death, and said act must necessarily appear in the testament because it is
the expression of the testator's last will and must be surrounded by
appropriate formalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then comes the
second part, to wit, the division in conformity with that disposition, and the
testator may make this division in the same will or in another will, or by an
act inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With these words, the law, in article 1056 as well as in article 1057,
which we <span style="">shall hereafter examine, makes
allusion to the forms or manner of making the partition and not to the effects
thereof, which means that, for purposes of partition the formal solemnities
which must accompany every testament or last will are not necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it necessary to observe the
special formalities required in case of donations, because it is not a matter
of disposing gratuitously of properties, but of dividing those which already
have been legally disposed of.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is thus seen that both the Spanish Supreme Court and the learned
and authoritative commentator, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
are of opinion that a testator may, by an act inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>,
partition his property, but he must first make a will with all the formalities
provided for by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it could not be
otherwise, for without a will there can be no testator; when the law,
therefore, speaks of the partition inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> made
by a testator of his property, it necessarily refers to that property which he
has devised to his heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person who
disposes of his property gratis inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> is not
called a testator, but a donor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
employing the word "testator," the law evidently desired to
distinguish between one who freely donates his property in life and one who
disposes of it by will to take effect after his death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are not in conformity
with the holding of the respondent court that the extrajudicial partition of
November 25, 1949 which under the old Civil Code was expressly prohibited as
against public policy had been validly ratified by the holographic will of Don
Jesus executed on January 5, 1955 and his codicil of </span>August 14,
1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">a </span>holding of the appellate court that a person who executes a will
is permitted to partition his properties pursuant to the provisions of Article
1056 of the old Civil Code even before executing his will as long as he
mentions this fact in the will, is not warranted under <span style="">the ruling of <span class="SpellE">Legasto</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span>,
<u>supra</u> and the </span><span style="">commentary </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span> as </span>quoted
above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule, therefore, that the
respondent court erred in denying probate to the will of Don Jesus dated
November 14, 1959; it erred in holding that Don Jesus being a party to the
extrajudicial partition of 1949 was contractually bound by the provisions
thereof and hence could not revoke his participation therein by the simple
expedience of making a new will with contrary provisions or dispositions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an error because the so-called
extrajudicial partition of 1949 is void and inoperative as a partition; neither
is it a valid or <span style="">enforceable contract because
it involved future inheritance; it may only be given effect as a donation inter
<span class="SpellE">vivos</span> of specific properties to the heirs made by the
parents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the document, the extrajudicial partition of <st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1949</st1:date>, contained
specific designation of properties allotted to each child, We rule that there
was substantial compliance with the rules on donations inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> under the old Civil Code (Article 633).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there could have been no
valid donation to the children of the other half reserved as the free portion
of Don Jesus and <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>
which, as stated in the deed, was to be divided equally among the children for
the simple reason that the property or properties were not specifically
described in the public instrument, an essential require­ment under Article 633
which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 633.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order
that a donation of real property be valid it must be made by public instrument
in which the property donated must be specifically described and in the amount
of the encumbrances to be assumed by the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>
expressed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The acceptance must be made in the deed of gift or in a separate
public writing; but it shall produce no effect if not made during the lifetime
of the donor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the acceptance is made by separate public instrument, authentic
notice thereof shall be given the donor, and this proceeding shall be noted in
both instruments."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This other half, therefore, remained as the disposable free
portion of the spouses which may be disposed of in such manner that either of
the spouses would like in regards to his or her share in such portion, unencumbered
by the provision enjoining the last surviving spouse to give equally to the
children what belongs or would pertain to him or her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The end result, therefore, is that Don Jesus
and <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>, in the Deed
of 1949, made to their children valid donations of only one-half of their
combined properties which must be charged against their <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
and cannot anymore be revoked unless <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>; the
other half remained entirely at the free disposal of the spouses with regards
to their respective shares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> on <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="10">October
 2, 1959</st1:date>, her share in the free portion was distributed in accordance
with her holographic will dated <st1:date year="1955" day="25" month="1">January
 25, 1955</st1:date> and her codicil dated <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be stressed here that the distribution of her properties was subject to
her holographic will and codicil, independently of the holographic will and
codicil of Don Jesus executed by him on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is fundamental because otherwise, to
consider both wills and codicils jointly would be to circumvent the prohibition
of the Civil Code on joint wills (Art. 818) and secondly because upon the death
of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>, only her
estate was being settled, and not that of Don Jesus.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the provisions of the holographic will
and codicil of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>
and We find no indication whatsoever that <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> expressly or impliedly instituted both the husband
and her children as heirs to her free portion of her share in the conjugal
assets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her holographic will, mention
of her children as heirs was made in the fourth clause but it only provided
that, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Cuatro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Que</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> <span class="SpellE">yo</span> <span class="SpellE">adquieriese</span>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of clarity and convenience, this fourth clause
provided that "Should I acquire new properties after the execution of this
testament, the same shall be partitioned among my spouse and above named
children or the children mentioned in above par. 3 in the same proportion, that
is, one-half (1/2) to my spouse; and the other half to my children in equal
parts." From the above-quoted provision, the children would only inherit
together with Don Jesus whatever new properties <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> would acquire after the execution of her will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the codicil of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> instituted her husband as sole heir to her share in
the free portion of the conjugal assets, and We quote that part of the codicil:</p>

the free portion of my property which have not been allocated in favor of my
children in the Document of Partition <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> and
that which should exceed 1/2 of the conjugal property of gains that pertains to

after the execution of this document.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In case it should be God's will that I survive my spouse, I hereby
declare that it is my will that any and all kinds of property that pertains to
me or would pertain to me, which have not been disposed of pursuant to the
partition, should be divided equally among my above-mentioned heirs after my
death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
children, therefore, would only receive equal shares in the remaining estate of
<span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> in the event
that she should be the surviving spouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To stress the point, <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>
did not oblige her husband to give equally to the children, upon his death, all
such properties she was bequeathing him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering now the
efficacy of Don Jesus' last will and testament executed on November 14, 1959 in
view of Our holding that <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay's</span>
will and codicil did not stipulate that Don Jesus will bestow the properties
equally to the children, it follows that all the properties of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> bequeathed to Don
Jesus under her holographic will and codicil became part of Don Jesus' estate
unburdened by any condition, obligation or proviso.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents insist that
Don Jesus was bound by the extrajudicial partition of </span><st1:date year="1949" day="25" month="11"><span style="">November
 25, 1949</span></st1:date><span style=""> and had in
fact conformed to said partition by making a holographic will and codicil with
exactly the same provisions as those of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>, which respondent court sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule, however, that Don Jesus was not
forever bound thereby for his previous holographic will and codicil as such,
would remain <span class="SpellE">revokable</span> at his discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Art. 828 of the new Civil Code is clear:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A will may be revoked by the testator
at any time before his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any waiver
or restriction of this </span>right is void." There can be no restriction
that may be made on his absolute freedom to revoke his holographic will and
codicil previously made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would
still hold true even if such previous will had as in the case at bar <u>already
been probated</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Palacios v. <span style="">Palacios, </span>106 Phil. 739).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the first place, probate only
authenticates the will and does not pass upon the efficacy of the dispositions
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And secondly, the rights to the
succession are transmitted only from the moment of the death of the decedent
(Article 777, New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fine,
Don Jesus retained the liberty of disposing of his property before his death to
whomsoever he chose, provided the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the
forced heirs are not prejudiced, which is not herein claimed for it is
undisputed that only the free portion of the whole <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>
estate is being contested.</p>

<p class="BODY">After clearly establishing that only Don Jesus was named as sole
heir instituted to the remaining estate of <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> in her holographic will and codicil resulting in all
such properties becoming the properties of Don Jesus alone, and after clearly
pointing out that Don Jesus can, in law, revoke his previous holographic will
and codicil, by making another will expressly <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
and revoking the former, the next issue for the Court's resolution is the
validity of the provisions of the contested will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though the law and jurisprudence are clear
that only questions about the extrinsic validity of the will may be entertained
by the probate court, the Court had, on more than one occasion, passed upon the
intrinsic validity of a will even before it had been authenticated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus We declared in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nuguid</u></span><u>
v. <span class="SpellE">Nuguid</span></u>, 17 SCRA <span style="">449:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The parties shunted aside the question of whether or not the
will should be allowed to probate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
them, the meat of the case is the intrinsic validity of the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Normally this comes only after the court has
declared that the will has been duly authenticated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

the event of probate or if the court rejects the will, probability <span style="">exist </span>that the case will come up once
again before us on the same issue of the intrinsic validity or nullity of the
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Result:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>waste of time, effort, expense, plus added
anxiety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the practical

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The last Will and
Testament of Don Jesus executed on November 14, 1959 contained an express
revocation of his holographic will of January 5, 1955 and the codicil of August
14, 1956; a statement requiring that all of his properties donated to his children
in the Deed of 1949 be collated and taken into account in the partition of his
estate; the institution of all his children as devisees and legatees to certain
specific properties; a statement bequeathing the rest of his properties and all
that may be acquired in the future, before his death, to Pablo and Francisca;
and a statement naming Francisca as executrix without bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering these testamentary provisions, a close scrutiny of
the properties distributed to the children under the Deed of 1949 and those
distributed under the contested will of Don Jesus does not show that the former
had in fact been included in the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This being so, it must be presumed that the intention of Don Jesus in
his last will was not to revoke the donations already made in the Deed of 1949
but only to redistribute his remaining estate, or that portion of the conjugal
assets totally left to his free disposal and that which he received as his
inheritance from <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> of
the forced heirs were left unimpaired, as in fact, not one of said forced heirs
claimed or intimated other­wise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
properties that were disposed of in the contested will belonged wholly to Don
Jesus Alsua's free portion and may be disposed of by him to whomsoever he may
choose.</p>

<p class="BODY">If he now favored Francisca more, as claimed by private
respondents, or Pablo as in fact he was, We cannot and may not sit in judgment
upon the motives and senti­ments of Don Jesus in doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have clearly laid down this rule in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bustamante</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Arevalo</span></u>,
73 Phil. 635, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>nevertheless it would be
venturesome for the court to advance its own idea of a just distribution of the
property in the face of a different mode of disposition so clearly expressed by
the testatrix in the latter will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>It would be a dangerous precedent to strain the
interpretation of a will in order to effect what the court believes to be an
equitable division of the estate of a deceased person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only functions of the courts in these
cases is to carry out the intention of the deceased as manifested in the
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once that intention has been
determined through a careful reading of the will or wills, and provided <span style="">the law </span>on <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span>
has not been violated, <span style="">it </span>is
beyond the place of judicial cognizance to inquire into the fairness or
unfairness of <span style="">any devise or <span class="SpellE">bequeast</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
should not sit in </span><span style="">judgment upon </span><span style="">the motives and sentiments of the testatrix,
first, because as already stated, nothing in the law restrained her from
disposing of her property in any manner she desired, and secondly, because
there are no adequate means of ascertaining the inward process of her cons­cience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was the sole judge of her </span><span style="">own </span><span style="">attitude toward those who expected her bounty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent court, in
trying to rationalize the will of </span>Don <span style="">Jesus which allegedly benefited and favored the petitioner to the
prejudice of the other heirs who would have been entitled to an equal share
under the extrajudicial partition of 1949, faced two alternatives- one, to
consider Don Jesus as a man of culture and honor and would not allow himself to
violate the previous agreement, and the other as one whose </span>mental
faculties <span style="">or his possession of the same
had been diminished considering that when the will was executed, he was already
84 years of age and in view of his weakness and advanced age, the actual
administration of his properties had been left to his assistant <span class="SpellE">Madarieta</span> who, for his part received instructions from
Francisca and her husband, Joseph Betts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the court, the better explanation is the latter, which is
not legally tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 799
of the New Civil Code which provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 799.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be of
sound mind, it is not necessary that the testator be in full possession of all
his reasoning faculties, or that his mind be wholly unbroken, unimpaired, or <span class="SpellE">unshattered</span> by disease, injury or other cause.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It shall be sufficient if the testator was able at the time of
making the will to know the nature of the estate to be disposed of, the proper
objects of his bounty, and the character of the testamentary act," </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the test of testamentary capacity is at
the time of the making of the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere
weakness of mind or partial imbecility from disease of body or from age does
not render a person incapable of making a will.</p>

<blockquote>"Between the highest degree of soundness of mind and memory
which unquestionably carries with it full testamentary capacity, and that
degrees of mental aberration <span style="">generally </span><span style="">known as </span><span style="">insanity </span><span style="">or idiocy, there
are numberless degrees of mental capacity or incapacity and while on one hand
it has been held that mere weakness of mind, or partial </span>imbecility from
disease of body, or from age, will not render a person incapable of making a
will; a weak or feebleminded person may make a valid will, provided he has
understanding and memory sufficient to enable him to know what he is about to
do and how or to whom he is disposing of his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To constitute a sound and disposing mind, it
is not necessary that the mind be unbroken or unimpaired or <span class="SpellE">unshattered</span>
by disease or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been
held that testamentary incapacity does not necessarily require that a person shall
actually be insane or of unsound mind." (<span class="SpellE">Bugnao</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ubag</span>, 14 Phil. 163).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">Civil </span>Code
itself provides under Article 798 that in order to make a will, it is essential
that the testator be of sound mind at the time of its execution, and under
Article 800, the law presumes that every person is of sound mind in the absence
of proof to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the acceptance by the respondent court of the findings of fact of the
trial court on the due execution of the last will and testament of Don Jesus
has foreclosed any and all claim to the contrary that the will was not executed
in accordance with the requirements of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But more than that, gleaned from the quoted portions of the appealed
decision, the described behavior of Don Jesus is not that of a mentally
incapacitated person nor one suffering from "senile dementia" as claimed
by private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these
accepted facts, We find that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) it was
Don Jesus himself who gave detailed instructions to his lawyer as to how he
wanted to divide his properties among his children by means of a list of his
properties with indications of what child to whom each property should pertain;
(b) the semi-final draft of the contested will prepared by his lawyer was even
corrected by Don Jesus; (c) on the day of the signing of the will at his house
in <span class="SpellE">Ligao</span>, "Don Jesus was in bright and lively
spirits x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, leading in
the conversation which ran from problems of farming and the merits of
French-made wines"; <span style="">(d) the
signing of the </span>will by Don Jesus and his attesting witnesses was made
after a statement from Don Jesus of the purpose of their meeting or gathering,
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Precisamente</span>
<span class="SpellE">es</span> <span class="SpellE">por</span> lo <span class="SpellE">que</span> he <span class="SpellE">llamado</span> a <span class="SpellE"><span style="">ustedes</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">que</span> <span class="SpellE">esten</span> <span class="SpellE">presentes</span> <span class="SpellE">para</span> ser <span class="SpellE">testigos</span> </span>de mi

<span class="SpellE">cuatro</span> <span style="">(4) </span><span class="SpellE">hijos</span> <span class="SpellE">todos</span> <span class="SpellE">ellos</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clearly then, Don Jesus knew exactly what
his actions were and the full implications thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rejecting probate of the will, respondent court further
pointed out other details which, in the words of the decision "are a
little bit difficult to reconcile with the ordinary course of things and of
life" such as the fact that Don Jesus had sought the probate of his will
of January 5, 1955 and his codicil of August 14, 1956 during his lifetime but
insofar as the will of November 14, 1959 is concerned, he had no intention of
seeking the probate thereof during his lifetime, the alleged redundant and
unnecessary proceedings undertaken by Don Jesus in selling the properties under
question to petitioner Francisca <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>-Betts when the
same properties had already been bequeathed to her in the <span style="">will </span>of November 14, 1959 and that
"nothing, absolutely nothing, could be made the basis for finding that Don
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> had regarded his other children with less
favor, and that he was more sympathetic to Francisca so as to disregard or
forget the former depriving them of benefits already given to them and rewarding
the latter with disproportionate advantages or benefits, to such an extreme as
to violate his previous disposition consecrated in the previous extrajudicial
partition, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8."</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioner that these details which respondent
court found difficult to reconcile with the ordinary course of things and of
life are mere conjectures, surmises or speculations which, however, do not
warrant or justify disallowance of the probate of the will of Don Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Don Jesus did not cause his
will to be probated during his lifetime while his previous holographic will and
codicil were duly probated when he was still alive is a mere speculation which
depends entirely on the discretion of Don Jesus as the testator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not require that a will be
probated during the lifetime of the testator and for not doing so there cannot
arise any favorable or unfavorable consequence <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties cannot correctly guess or surmise
the motives of the testator and neither can the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such surmise, speculation or conjecture is no
valid and legal ground to reject allowance or disallowance of the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same thing can be said as to whatever
reason Don Jesus had for selling the properties to his daughter Francisca when
he had already assigned the same properties to her in his will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While We can speculate that Don Jesus desired
to have possession of the properties transferred to Francisca after the sale
instead of waiting for his death may be a reasonable explanation or speculation
for the act of the testator and yet there is no certainty that such was
actually the reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is as good a
conjecture as the respondents may offer or as difficult to accept which
respondent court believes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conjecture
is always a conjecture; it can never be admitted as evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the annulment case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only issue raised anent the civil case for annulment of the two
Deeds of Sale executed by and between Don Jesus and petitioner Francisca is
their validity or nullity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents
mainly contend that the sales were fictitious or simulated, there having been
no actual consideration paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
further insist that the issue raised is a question of fact and, therefore, not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> in a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding before the
Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
petitioners herein maintain that it was error for the respondent court to set
aside on appeal the factual findings of the trial court that the two sales were
valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the jurisprudence of this Court in cases brought
to Us from the Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing and revising the errors
of law imputed to it, its findings of fact being conclusive; and this same
principle applies even if the Court of Appeals was in disagreement with the
lower court as to the weight of evidence with a consequent reversal of its
findings of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what should not be
ignored by lawyers and litigants alike is the more basic principle that the
"findings of fact" described as "final" or
"conclusive" are those borne out by the record or those which are
based upon substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
general rule laid down by the Supreme Court does not declare the absolute
correctness of all the findings of fact made by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are exceptions to the general rule,
where We have reviewed and revised the findings of fact of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the exceptions to the
rule that findings of fact by the Court of Appeals cannot be reviewed on
appeals by <i>certiorari</i> are:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the conclusion is <span style="">a </span>finding grounded entirely on
speculation, surmises or conjectures (Joaquin vs. Navarro, 93 Phil. 257);</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the inference made
is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible (Luna vs. <span class="SpellE">Linatok</span>,
74 Phil. 15);</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where there is <span style="">a </span>grave abuse of discretion (<span class="SpellE">Buyco</span> vs. People, 51 OG 2927);</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the judgment is
based on a misapprehension of facts (Cruz vs. <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span>,
L-4875, Nov. 27, 1953);</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the findings of fact
are conflicting (<span class="SpellE">Casica</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaseca</span>,
L-9590, April 30, 1957); and</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Court of
Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the
same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
(Evangelista vs. Alto Surety &amp; Ins. Co., L-11139, April 23, 1958; Ramos vs.
Pepsi Cola, L-22533, Feb. 9, 1967, 19 SCRA 289).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, We
find and so declare that the respondent court's conclusion as to the nullity of
the contested sales was not supported by the evidence on record and adduced
during the trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evident from the records
are the following documentary evidence:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) Exhibit U, a deed of sale over agricultural lands executed on August
26, 1961 by Don Jesus in favor of Francisca for the consideration of Seventy
Thousand Pesos </span>(P70,000.00), <span style="">which
document bears the signature of Don Jesus, not assailed as a forgery, and the
signature of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span> as an instrumental witness,
again not assailed as a forgery nor alleged as done thru fraud, force or
threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) Exhibit "W", a
deed of sale over urban lots executed on November 26, 1962 for the
consideration of Eighty Thousand Pesos (P80,000.00), which document also bears
the signature of Don Jesus, also admittedly not a forgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(3) Exhibit "F", a document dated
August 26, 1961 and signed by Don Jesus and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>
as witness, acknowledging receipt of a Bank of Philippine Islands Check No.
0252 in the amount of Seventy Thousand Pesos (P70,000.00) for the </span>sale
of 33 parcels of agricultural land to Francisca under the same date; again,
Pablo did not deny the genuineness of his signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(4) Exhibit "X", a Bank of the
Philippine <st1:place>Islands</st1:place> Check No. D-6979, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date>, in the amount of
P32,644.71, drawn and signed by Francisca, payable to Don Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(5) Exhibit "X-1", a second Bank of
Philippine Islands Check (No. D-6980) also dated <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1962</st1:date> in the amount of P47,355.29, drawn by
Francisca and payable to Don Jesus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(6)
Exhibit "X-3" and "X-5", endorsements on the back of the
last two checks by Don Jesus, again, his signatures thereon were not assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(7) Exhibit <span style="">"A" </span>(in the annulment case), a Bureau of Internal
Revenue Receipt (No. 2347260) dated <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1962</st1:date> with a notation acknowledging the receipt of BPI Check No.
D-6980 in the amount of P47,355.29 from Don Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>
in payment of Balance of Transfer of Tax <span style="">Ass.
</span>No. EA-35415-19 plus interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are convinced and satisfied from this array of documentary evidence that in
fact, Don Jesus sold the subject properties to his daughter, Francisca for the
total consideration of P150,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The claim of the private
respondents that the sales were fictitious and void for being without cause or
consideration is as weak and flimsy as the ground upon which the respondent
court upheld said claim on the basis that there was no need for funds in Don
Jesus' old age aside from the speculation that there was nothing in the
evidence that showed what motivated Don Jesus to change his mind as to favor
Francisca and discriminate against the other children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two contracts of sale executed by Don
Jesus in favor of Francisca are evidenced by Exhibits "U" and
"W", the genuineness of which were not at all assailed at any time
during this long drawn-out litigation of 15 </span>years standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the consideration stated in the
contracts were paid is also sufficiently proved as the receipts thereof by Don
Jesus were even signed by one of the private respondents, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Alsua</span>, as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter cannot now deny the payment of the consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if he now allege that in fact no
transfer of money was involved, We find his allegation belied by Exhibits
"X-3" and "X-5", which show that the checks of Francisca
made payable to Don Jesus were in fact given to Don Jesus as he endorsed them
on the back thereof, and most specifically Exhibit "A" in the
annulment case, which proved that Don Jesus actually used Exhibit "X-1"
to complete payment on the estate and inheritance tax on the estate of his wife
to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents further insist that the sales were fraudulent
because of the inadequacy of the given price.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inadequacy of consideration does not vitiate a contract unless it is
proven, which in the case at bar was not, that there was fraud, mistake or
undue influence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 1355, New
Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not find the
stipulated price as so inadequate to shock the court's conscience, considering
that the price paid was much higher than the assessed value of the subject
properties and considering that the sales were effected by a father to her
daughter in which case filial love must be taken into account.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision appealed
