				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendants Alfredo Duero and Josefina Espejo appeal from the decision of the 
Court of First Instance of Iloilo (in Civil Case No. 5042) ordering them to 
vacate and deliver to plaintiff Perpetua Gargollo, a parcel of land (Lot No. 
3016 of the Cadastral, Survey of Cabatuan, Iloilo).
<p>The facts of the case are briefly stated in the decision of the lower court, 
in this manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the pleadings of the parties, it clearly appears that on May 20, 1953, 
the plaintiff sold to the defendants with <i>pacto de retro</i> a parcel of land 
known as Lot No. 3016 of the Cadastral Survey of Cabatuan, Iloilo, with the 
improvements thereon, for the sum of P400.00 which was subsequently increased to 
P750.00; that according to the deed of sale with <i>pacto de retro</i>, the 
plaintiff could redeem said lot on or before the year 1962; that sometime in. 
September, 1958, the plaintiff verbally notified the defendants that she would 
redeem the property in the following October, and on October 18, 1958, she, thru 
her attorney, gave the defendants written notice to accept the redemption amount 
of P750.00, but the defendants refused to accept the payment; that on October 
29, 1958, the plaintiff deposited the said amount of P750.00 with the Clerk of 
Court under official receipt No. 12474, advising the defendants to withdraw the 
said amount; that the defendants refused to withdraw the said amount, for the 
reason that, because of the promise of the plaintiff to definitely sell the land 
to them for the sum of Pl,000.00, which promise was not carried out, they made 
improvements on the land by planting bananas and other fruit trees and 
converting a portion of the land into rice paddies, thereby incurring expenses 
in the amount of not less than P200.00, aside from planting seasonal crops of 
rice, corn, etc., which were not yet ready for harvest, and paying delinquent 
taxes in the amount of P25.00.</p>
<p>"Upon pre-trial on January 24, 1959, the defendants, thru Atty. Caspe, agreed 
to turn over the property in question to the plaintiff upon payment by the 
latter of the purchase price of P750.00 deposited with the Clerk of Court, plus 
the sum of P25.00 as reimbursement for real estate tax paid by the defendants on 
the land prior to the time they took possession thereof, plus the value of the 
improvements they introduced in the land to be assessed by a person whom the 
defendants and the plaintiff would appoint, the said plaintiff and defendants 
agreeing to abide by the finding of said person they would appoint as to the 
value of the improvements introduced by the defendants in the land while the 
same was in their possession.</p>
<p>"For one reason or another, the plaintiff, and the defendants failed to agree 
as to the person to undertake said assessment, much less, as to the value of the 
said improvements. Consequently, in its order dated February 14, 1959, the Court 
set the case for bearing on February 21, 1959, at 10:00 o'clock a.m., solely for 
the reception of the evidence of the parties regarding the value of said 
improvements. The hearing was accordingly started, but, for lack of material 
time, it was scheduled to be continued on June 1, 1959, at 8:30 o'clock a.m. On 
June 1, 1959, however, the parties manifested in open court that they had agreed 
to submit a written amicable settlement, for which reason the hearing of the 
case was postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>"On June 8, 1959, however, the counsel for the plaintiff filed a motion, 
stating that the proposed amicable settlement failed and that in view thereof he 
advised his client, the plaintiff, to manifest, as in Tact, in her attached 
affidavit, she manifested her intention not to exercise the option to refund the 
defendants' expenses or pay the increase in value of the land in question as 
provided in paragraph 2 of Article 546 of the Civil Code, thereby claiming the 
right given her by Article 547 of the same code. The counsel for the plaintiff 
consequently prayed that judgment be rendered (1) declaring the land in question 
as already redeemed in view of the deposit in Court of the redemption price of 
P750.00; (2) ordering the defendants to remove. all her improvements on the land 
and to vacate the same; and (3) ordering the defendants to pay the costs of the 
suit.</p>
<p>"On June 13, 1959, the defendants filed a written reply to the aforesaid 
motion, stating among other things, that according to the provisions of Article 
1616 of the Civil Code, the vendor cannot avail himself of the right of 
repurchase without returning. to the vendee the price of the sale and in 
addition: (1) the expenses of the contract, and any other legitimate payments 
made by reason of the sale; (2) the necessary and useful expenses made on the 
thing sold.'</p>
<p>"As may be seen, however, at the pre-trial of the case held on January 24, 
1959, the parties reduced the question at issue to only one, to wit: the value 
of the improvements introduced by the defendants in the land in question. 
Although the purchase price appearing in the deed of purchase with <i>pacto de 
retro</i> entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants was only 
P400.00, it was agreed at said pre-trial that it should be P750.00, together 
with the sum of P25.00 as reimbursement for delinquent real estate taxes paid by 
the defendants on the land prior to the time they took possession thereof and 
the value of the improvements, there being; no necessity of any expense 
whatsoever for the preservation of the land. * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>On the basis of the foregoing facts, the lower court, on June 15, 1955, 
rendered a decision in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the express manifestation of the plaintiff of her intention not 
to exercise the option given her by paragraph 2 of Article 546 of the Civil 
Code, the Court believes that the continuation flf the hearing of this case for 
the sole purpose of determining the value of the useful improvements introduced 
by the defendants in the land in question has become unnecessary, for the reason 
that, according to the new provision embodied in Article 547 of the Civil Code, 
the defendants, as possessors in good faith are not entitled to retain the land, 
but only to remove the said improvements therefrom if the same can be done 
without damage thereto.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby renderedâ€”</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) Ordering the Clerk of this Court to turn over to the defendants 
the sum of P750.00 deposited with him by the plaintiff as repurchase price of 
the land in question (Lot No, 3016 of the Cadastral Survey of Cabatuan, 
Iloilo);</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) Ordering the defendants to forthwith vacate and deliver the 
aforesaid land to the plaintiff;</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) Ordering the plaintiff to allow the defendants and his laborers 
to enter the land at reasonable hours of the day and remove all the useful 
improvements introduced by them therein within the period of ninety (90) days 
from the date hereof;</p>
<p>"(<i>d</i>) Ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendants the sum of P25.00 as 
reimbursement for the delinquent real estate taxes paid by them prior to the 
time they took possession thereof upon delivery to the plaintiff by the 
defendants of the corresponding official receipts evidencing said payments.</p>
<p>"Without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED."</p></blockquote>
<p>Their motion for reconsideration of said decision having been denied by the 
court, defendants appealed directly to us.</p>
<p>The appeal is meritorious. It appears that the judgment of the trial court 
requiring, among other things, defendants (vendees <i>a retro</i>) to vacate and 
deliver the land in question to plaintiff (vendor <i>a retro</i>), is predicated 
on the ground that, according to Article 547<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> in relation to Article 546<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> of the Civil Code, defendants "are not 
entitled to retain the land, but only to remove the said improvements therefrom, 
if the same can be done without damage thereto."</p>
<p>The trial court has, clearly, committed a reversible error, because the 
provision applicable to the instant case is not the aforecited Article 547 of 
the Civil Code, which treats of <i>possession</i>, but Article 1616 of the same 
Code, which deals specifically with <i>conventional redemption</i>, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 1616. The vendor cannot avail himself of the right of repurchase 
without returning to the vendee the price of the sale, and in addition:</p>
<p>"(1) The expenses of the contract, and any other legitimate payments made by 
reason of the sale;</p>
<p>"(2) The necessary and useful expenses made on the thing 
sold."</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems quite clear from this provisions, that for a vendor <i>a retro</i> 
to be entitled to exercise his right of redemption, he must reimburse the vendee 
<i>a retro</i>, not only (1) the price of the sale, but also (2) the expenses of 
the contract and any other legitimate payments made by reason of the sale, and 
(3) the necessary and useful expenses made on the thing sold. Note that the 
vendor <i>a retro</i> is given no option to require the vendee <i>a retro</i> to 
remove the useful improvements on the land subject of the sale <i>a retro</i>, 
unlike that granted the owner of a land under Articles 546 and 547 of the Civil 
Code. Under said Article 1616, the vendor <i>a retro</i> must pay for the useful 
improvements introduced by the vendee <i>a retro</i>; otherwise, the latter may 
retain possession of the land until reimbursement is made.</p>
<p>Since, in the instant case, plaintiff (vendor <i>a retro</i>) is unwilling to 
reimburse defendants (vendees <i>a retro</i>) the value of the useful 
improvements introduced by the latter on the land in question, as agreed upon by 
them at the pre-trial held on January 24, 1959, it stands to reason that 
defendants may not lawfully be ordered nor compelled to vacate and deliver said 
land to plaintiff.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the trial court appealed from is reversed and set 
aside, and the case is remanded to said court, which is hereby directed to 
continue with the hearing of the same, for the purpose of determining the value 
of the useful improvements introduced by defendants on the land in question and, 
thereafter, render judgment in accordance with law. Without pronouncement as to 
costs. So ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,
