<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1972">May 30, 1972</st1:date>,
Margarita <span class="SpellE">Caco</span> instituted against <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salao</span> Civil Case No. C-2428 in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City, seeking the rescis­sion of a contract of lease and the recovery of the
pos­session of the leased premises and the recovery of unpaid rentals as well
as attorney's fees, actual and incidental expenses and moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
alleged that on February 13, 1958, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a
lease contract of a parcel of land located in <span class="SpellE">Santolan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, containing
an area of 2,638 square meters, more or less, declared under Tax No. 27013 in
the name of Martin Buena­ventura and valued at P2,870.00; that the contract of
lease was for a period of five (5) years at a yearly rental of P400.00; <span style="">that </span>on May 3, 1958, the parties exe­cuted
another contract of lease over the same parcel of land extending the period of
lease for fifteen (15) years to end on February 28, 1978 at an increased annual
rental of P600.00; that in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
amended lease agreement; the defendant obli­gated himself to pay the yearly
rental for said lot in the amount of P600.00 on the first day of the month of
March of every year payable in advance; that the defendant failed to pay the
yearly rental for 1972 and despite re<span style="">peated
demands, he still failed to comply with his obli­gation; that aside from having
failed to pay the yearly rental, the defendant violated the terms of the lease
con­tract by (a) assigning the lease to one Amelia S. Antonio without the
knowledge and consent of the plaintiff; and (b) allowing the present occupants
of the leased premises to devote the same to the purpose not intended by the
par­ties; that on April 7, 1972, the plaintiff made a written demand to the
defendant to vacate the premises but the lat­ter has ignored and chosen not to
make any reply to said demand, but instead allowed a Chinaman to start a new
construction inside the premises; that the plaintiff re­ceived a letter from
the assignee, Amelia S. Antonio, who </span><span style="">offered to pay the rental, which offer, however, was rejected by the
plaintiff by returning the three (3) money orders to said Amelia S. Antonio;
that as a consequence of these acts of the defendant, the plaintiff was cons­trained
to engage the services of counsel for P2,000.00 to bring this suit, and that
the plaintiff, furthermore, suffered actual and moral damages in the sum of
P10,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on August 7, 1972, the defendant averred as affirmative and special
defenses that because of his advanced age and weakened physical condi­tion, he
had requested and authorized his granddaughter, Amelia S. Antonio, to
administer the improvements which he had put on the leased lot; that as such
representative of the defendant, Amelia S. Antonio had, for the past several
years, remitted the annual rentals on the leased lot to the plaintiff, who,
without objection and unquestioningly, received and acknowledged such
remittances with the excep­tion of the last one, corresponding to the annual
rental for the current period, March 1972 to March 1973, which plaintiff
unjustifiably, unreasonably and arbitrarily returned to the defendant; that
defendant's remittance of the annual rental for the period from March 1972 to
March 1973 is valid, binding and sufficient, and plaintiff's rejection thereof
and returning the same to the defendant is unjustified, arbitrary and illegal;
that the plaintiff is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from complaining
against the alleged violation of the contract by the defendant as plaintiff had
long been informed of and had abetted and tolerated and condoned defendant's
manner of using the leased lot; that plaintiff's complaint is filed with malice
and bad faith aforethought, and is motivated by plaintiff's selfish desire to
recover possession of the leased lot even before the expiration of <span style="">the agreed period of lease in expectation of
higher income or more lucrative returns from the property; that the plaintiff had
invested not less than P60,000.00 for improve­ments on the leased lot, which
capital constituted his life savings and hard earned income; that plaintiff's
action had lapsed and had been lost by prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span>;
that the complaint fails to state a cause of action; and that the court has no
jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The de­fendant
interposed a counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court dismissed the complaint and ordered the plaintiff
<span style="">to </span>pay the defendant damages and
attorney's fees in a decision dated <st1:date month="10" day="8" year="1973">October
 8, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals where the appeal
was docketed as CA-G. <span class="GramE">R. No. 54471-R.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner raised the
following issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The award of moral, actual and compensatory
damages to the pri­vate respondent in the total amount of P10,000.00 should not
have been granted due to the following reasons:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The filing of the complaint was done without
malice and was not capri­cious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
done in the noblest purpose of seeking redress in our courts of justice for the
correction of a violation of a contract of lease;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such award is not the one contemplated as an
'ana­logous case' as provided under Article 2219 of our Civil Code;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such award is contrary to established
jurisprudence and public policy.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court of Appeals exceeded its
appellate jurisdiction by issuing the Orders dated <st1:date month="7" day="4" year="1974">July 4, 1974</st1:date> and <st1:date month="7" day="28" year="1976">July
 28, 1976</st1:date> which in effect off­set the rental against damages awarded
to private respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of law and equity rescission of the
Contract of Lease would have been proper and just and damages claimed by
petitioner would have been fairly awarded if not for abuse of discretion by the
respondent court involved in the case at bar."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the private respondent transferred not
only all rights over the lease contract but the assignee Amelia S. Antonio
assumed all the obligations im­posed on the lessee in said contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that <span style="">the intention was for <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Salao</span> to disassociate himself completely from the lease
contract he had entered into with the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This agreement is an assignment of the lease
and not a mere sub-lease of the leased premises.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals held that the assignment made by <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Salao</span> in favor of his
granddaughter, Amelia S. Antonio, does not constitute a ground for the rescission
of the contract of lease because there is no provision in the lease contract
prohibiting the assignment of the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue on the rescission of the contract of lease will become
academic on <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1978">February 28, 1978</st1:date>
when the period of said contract expires.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the issue on the damages, while it is true that the
assignment of the contract without the con­sent of the petitioner does not
constitute by itself a ground for the rescission of the lease contract, it may
be considered as a justification of the filing of the action for rescission by
the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that the original petitioner acted
maliciously and in bad faith in instituting the action for rescission against
the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said peti­tioner
apparently believed in good faith that the assignment of the lease contract by <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Salao</span> in favor of his
grand daughter, Amelia S. Antonio, is a ground for rescission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original petitioner was not a
lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time she instituted the
action, she was old and sickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
cannot be expected to know correctly the effect of the assignment of the
contract of lease by <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Salao</span>
to his grand­daughter Amelia S. Antonio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, by analogy with the third paragraph of Article 526, Civil Code of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
her mistake in filing the action for rescission of the lease contract may be
the basis of good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the petitioner is not liable for any
kind of damages and for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the private respondent has not been paying the
rentals since the decision of the lower court was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should pay all rentals in arrears.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby modified
in that the petitioner shall not be liable to pay any damages, expenses of
litigation, attorney's fees or costs to the private respondent and the private
res­pondent is ordered to pay the petitioner all the rentals in arrears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without pronouncement as to
