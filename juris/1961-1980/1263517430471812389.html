				<BR><STRONG>SANCHEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The decisive issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not
the strips of land owned by Philippine National Railways (PNR) which are on
both sides of its railroad track, and are part of its right of way for its
railroad operations but temporarily leased, are agricultural lands within the
purview of the Agricul­tural Tenancy Act and the Agricultural Land Reform Code,
such as would come within the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this particular case are these:</p>

<p class="BODY">PNR, a government-owned corporation, is the registered owner of
three (3) strips of land with a uniform width of 30 meters adjoining one
another longitudinally, the same being part of its railroad right of way
running from Manila to <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These strips of land lie within the
municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Oas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Polangui</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Albay</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the center thereof is a track measuring
ten (10) to twelve (12) meters in width where railroad ties are placed and
rails built for running locomotives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
both sides of the track, or about two (2) to five (5) meters away from the
embankment of the track, are telegraph and telephone posts fifty (50) meters
apart from each other, which maintain com­munication wires necessary in the
operation of PNR trains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PNR draws earth
from these sides to fill up the railroad track whenever it is destroyed by
water during rainy days; and uses them as depository of railroad materials for
the repair of des­troyed lines, posts, bridges during washouts, or other dam­aged
parts of the line occasioned by derailments or other calamities.</p>

<p class="BODY">The portions of these lands not actually occupied by the railroad
track had been a source of trouble.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People occupied them; they reap profits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.
Disputes among those desiring to occupy them cropped up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on the face of all these that, with
adequate provisions to safeguard railroad operations, PNR adopted temporary
rules and regulations, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
the possession and enjoyment of the property should be awarded to interested
persons thru competitive public bidding; (b) the rental of the premises is to
be determined from the amount offered by the highest bidder; (c) the duration
of the lease shall be for a limited period, not to exceed three (3) years; (d)
the lessee cannot sublease the premises; (e) the lease contract is revocable at
any time upon demand by the owner, whenever it needs the same for its own use
or for a more beneficial purpose; (f) the owner can enter the leased premises
during the period of the lease to make necessary repairs; and (g) the lessee
shall not use the premises in a manner prejudicial to the operation of the
trains.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1963, PNR awarded the portions of the three strips of
land aforementioned which are on both sides of the track, after a competitive
public bidding, to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> for a period of three (3) years and under
conditions hereinbefore set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
civil law lease contract in printed form was, on <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1963</st1:date>, entered into by and between PNR and <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
contract expressly stipulates that <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> was 'to
occupy and use the property x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<u>temporarily</u> for agri­culture." Consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
was P130.00 per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span>, however, failed to take possession because
respondent <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
was occupying the land, had a house thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Doltz</span> claims to be a tenant of previous
awardees, and later, of <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March 1965, PNR and <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span>
filed suit against <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span> for recovery of possession
of the premises in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
They there averred that sometime in January 1963, <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
illegally entered the land, cons­tructed a house thereon occupying about fifty
(50) square meters, and planted <span class="SpellE">palay</span> on the other
portions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed that <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span> remove his house, vacate the premises, restore pos­session
to PNR or <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span>, pay PNR P160 per annum as reason­able
compensation for the occupation of the premises from January 1963, and P2,000
as expenses of litigation, pay <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> P500
annually from 1963, and shoulder the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>' answer in that case averred, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that he had been a tenant on the
property for over twenty years; that he had been placed thereon by the deceased
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Gomba</span> who leased the, property from the then
Manila Railroad Company (now PNR); that he became the tenant of <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> de Vera, <span class="SpellE">Gomba's</span>
successor; that he is the tenant of <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span>, having
given the latter's share of 1/3 during the last two harvests; and that the case
is properly cognizable by the Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the court's request, <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> agreed to temporarily liquidate the
harvest on a sharing ratio of 70-30 in <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>' favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been suggested in the record that said case - Civil Case
3021 - was dismissed by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
upon the ground that the subject matter of the action is tenancy; that
petitioners have appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case,
parenthetically, has not yet reached this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the aforesaid Civil Case 3021 was pending in the <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> court of first instance, <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
registered with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) a petition against <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> for security of tenure, the adoption of a sharing
ratio of 70-30 of the crops, and <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span> of
past harvests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the present case
- CAR Case 692, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> '67, Court of Agrarian Relations,
Ninth Regional District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Branch II, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>, Petitioner, versus
<span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span>,
Respondent." PNR intervened in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners herein there maintained the position that the premises in
controversy are not an agricul­tural land within the contemplation of the
Agricultural Tenancy Act (Republic Act 1199) or the Agricultural Land Reform
Code (Republic Act 3844); that no tenancy relationship existed between the
parties; that CAR, therefore, lacked jurisdiction over the case; and that there
is a pending case between the same parties in another court involving the same
subject matter and the same cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the CAR promulgated its decision of <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It upheld its jurisdiction over the case,
maintained <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span> in the peaceful possession of the
parcels of land as tenant on a 70-30 sharing ratio in <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>'
favor, ordered <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> to pay <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
P250 attorneys' fees and the costs, but dismissed the latter's claim for <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span> of past harvests for lack of substantial
evidence. Petitioners' move to reconsider the said decision failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They now come to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They specifically question <span class="SpellE">CAR's</span> jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Is the land here involved an agricultural land within the
meaning of the Agricultural Tenancy Act and the Agricul­tural Land Reform Code?</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Section 3 of the <u>Agricultural</u> <u>Tenancy</u> <u>Act</u>,
"[a]<span class="SpellE">gricultural</span> tenancy is the physical
possession by a person of land <u>devoted to agriculture</u> belonging to, or
legally possessed by, another for the purpose of production through the labor
of the former and of the members of his immediate farm house­hold, in
consideration of which the former agrees to share the harvest with the latter,
or to pay a price certain or ascertain­able, either in produce or in money, or
in both."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The term "agricultural land" as understood by the <u>Agricultural</u>
<u>Land</u> <u>Reform</u> <u>Code</u> is not as broad in meaning as it is known
in the constitutional sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
interpreted in <span class="SpellE"><u>Krivenko</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Register</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Deeds</u>, 79 Phil. 461, 471, the phrase "agricultural
land", constitutionally speaking, includes all lands that are neither
mineral nor timber lands and embraces within its wide sweep not only lands
strictly agricul­tural or devoted to cultivation for agricultural purposes but
also commercial, industrial, residential lands and lands for other pur­poses.
On the other hand, by Section 166(1) of the <u>Agricultural</u> <u>Land</u> <u>Reform</u>
<u>Code</u>, "[a]<span class="SpellE">gricultural</span> land' means land <u>devoted</u>
<u>to</u> <u>any</u> <u>growth</u>, including but not limited to crop lands,
salt beds, fish ponds, idle land and abandoned land as defined in paragraphs 18
and 19 of this section, respectively."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious then that under the law, the land here in
controversy does not fit into the concept of agricultural land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PNR cannot devote it to agricultural because
by its own charter, Republic Act 4156, PNR cannot engage in agriculture.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the land - which adjoins the railroad track on both sides
- is part of <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> right of way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That right of way is not limited to the
particular space occupied by the roadbed or its main track. It also includes
the portions occupied by the telephone and telegraph posts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It extends to a width of 30 meters which
reasonably gives the train locomotive engineer a clear commanding view of the
track and its switches ahead of him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The entire width is important to <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span>
railroad opera­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which should not
be hampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, communication lines
must not be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buildings should
not be constructed so close to the track.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, it is not so easy to prevent people from walking along the
track; animals, too, may stray into the area; obstructions there could be along
the track itself which might cause derailment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of these could prevent the locomotive engineer from taking the necessary
precautions on time to avert accidents which may cause damage to the trains,
injury to its passengers, and even loss of life.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the use of the strips of land on both sides of the track
in railroad operation is inconsistent with agricultural activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of lease authorizes the railroad
company to enter upon the premises to make repairs, place its materials on the
land. It may even take soil from the land to fill up any part of the railroad
track destroyed by water during rainy days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What if PNR should decide to construct another parallel track on the
land leased?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occupant of the land
cannot prevent or stop PNR from doing any of these. Security of tenure so
important in landlord-tenant relationship may not thus be attained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing are considerations sufficient enough to deter us
from adopting the view that the disputed land - in narrow strips - is
agricultural land within the meaning of the Agricultural Tenancy Act and the
Agricultural Land Reform Code. By destination, it is not agricultural,</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Nor may <span class="SpellE">Pampilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
be considered as a true and lawful tenant.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be borne in mind is the fact that PNR executed with <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> a civil law
lease contract, not an agricul­tural lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This distinction is expressly recognized by the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> <u>That</u>
<u>contract</u> <u>is</u> <u>temporary</u>, at best for a short term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is revocable any time upon demand by PNR
whenever it needs the same for its own use or for a more beneficial purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the assumption that the land is agricultural, there is
the circumstance that PNR prohibits the sublease of the pre­mises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> lessees
cannot give what they are not allowed to give.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any contract then of sublease between <span class="SpellE">Doltz</span>
the sup­posed tenant, and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Gomba</span> or <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> de Vera the pre­vious awardees, or even of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bingabing</span> the present <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> - without <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> consent -
cannot bind the latter. No such consent was here given.</p>

<p class="BODY">This ushers us to a principle shaped out by jurisprudence that
the security of tenure guaranteed by our tenancy law may be invoked only by
tenants <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>, not by those who are
not true and lawful tenants.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In <span class="SpellE"><u>Pabustan</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>De</u> <u>Guzman</u>,
L-12898, <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1960</st1:date>,
the tenant sublet the landholding to a third person without the knowledge and
consent of the landowner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an <span class="SpellE">eject­ment</span> suit brought by the landowner against said third
person in the CAR, this Court held that the CAR had no jurisdiction over the
case because no tenancy relationship existed between the parties, as the third
person was, in reality, an unlawful squatter or intruder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correlating <span class="SpellE"><u>Pabustan</u></span>
to the present case, the lessee here had no power to sublet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also thus no legally cog­nizable
relationship of tenancy between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, accordingly, rule that CAR, does not have jurisdiction over
the case at bar and the proceedings below are thus null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the reasons given</b>, the judgment of the Court of
Agrarian Relations of <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1968</st1:date>
in its Case 692, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> '67, under review is hereby
