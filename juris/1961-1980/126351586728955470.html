<p class="BODY">Petitioner Republic Cement Corporation is a domestic corporation
engaged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, in the mining,
from mineral lands held by it under lease and/or "mines temporary permit”
from the Government, of limestone, silica and other minerals used in the
production of cement.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the period from May 1957 to December 1959, petitioner had
paid royalties and/or <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes
based upon the value of the raw materials or minerals it had extracted and
later used in the manufacture of cement, as determined by the "cost of
production" or extraction of said materials or minerals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the theory that said royalties and/or <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes are assessed on the market value of
the <u>cement</u> produced and sold by petitioner as finished product, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue - hereinafter referred to as respondent -
demanded from petitioner the payment of P79<span class="GramE">,876.72</span>, as
deficiency <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax and
surcharge, based upon the amount it had realized from the sale of cement from
September to December 1959.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for a reconsideration, but, instead of granting
the same, respondent increased the assessment of P498<span class="GramE">,653.04</span>,
covering the period from May 1957 to August 1959, on the basis of petitioner's
gross receipts from the sale of cement.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The first question is far from being one of first im­pression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has already been settled adversely to res­pondent
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In CEPOC v. Commissioner of Int.
Revenue,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Barrera, held:</p>

<blockquote>"Ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax is a tax not on the
minerals, but upon the privilege of severing or extracting the same from the
earth, the government's right to exact the said impost springing from the <span class="SpellE">Regalian</span> theory of State ownership of its natural
resources.” xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> While cement is composed of 80%
minerals, it is not merely an admixture or blending of raw materials, as lime,
silica, shale and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
result of a definite process - the crushing of minerals, grinding, mixing, <span class="SpellE">calcining</span>, cooling, <span class="GramE">adding</span> of <span class="SpellE">retarder</span> or raw gypsum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, before cement reaches its saleable form, the minerals had
already undergone a chemical change through manufacturing process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This could not have been the state of
"mineral products" that the law contemplates for purposes of imposing
the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> this tax is imposed on the privilege of
extracting or severing the minerals from the mines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To our minds, therefore, the inclusion of the
term mineral products is intended to comprehend cases where the mined or
quarried elements may not be usable in its original state without application
of simple treatments xxx which process does not necessarily involve the change
or transformation of the raw materials into a composite distinct product.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> While the
selling price of cement may reflect the actual market value of cement, said
selling price cannot be taken as the market value also of the minerals
composing the cement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it was not the
cement that was mined, only the minerals composing the finished product."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We ratified this view in denying the
motion for reconsideration of our decision in the same case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language of Mr. Justice Reyes
(J.B.L.):</p>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">xxx</span> the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span>
tax in question should be based on the actual market value of the quar­ried
minerals used in producing cement, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the law intended to impose the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span>
tax upon the market value of the component mineral products in their original
state before processing into cement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx
The law does not Impose a tax on cement <u>qua</u> cement, but on mineral
products, at least 80% of which must be minerals extracted by the lessee,
concessionaire or owner of mineral lands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court did not, and could <span class="GramE">not,</span>
rule that cement is a manufactured product subject to sales tax, for the reason
that such liability had never been litigated by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it did declare is that, while cement is
a mineral product, it is no longer in the state or condition contemplated by
the law; hence the market value of the cement could not be the basis for
computing the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax, since the ad <span class="SpellE">valorem</span> tax is a severance tax, i.e., a charge upon the
privilege of severing or extracting minerals from the earth, (Dec. p. 4) and is
due and payable upon removal of the mineral product from its bed or mine.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Soon later, we had occasion to reiterate that view.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the second question, petitioner's practice of computing the <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax on the basis of the "cost of
pro­duction" of the raw materials or minerals extracted from its mines,
contravenes Section 243 of the Tax Code, read­ing:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
taxes on output of mineral lands not covered by lease.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There shall be assessed and collected on the <u>actual
market value</u> of the annual gross output of the minerals or mineral products
extracted or produced from all mineral lands, not covered by lease an <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax, payable to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, in the amount of one and one-half per centum of the value of
said output.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the minerals or mineral products are removed from the
mines, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his representatives shall first
be notified of such removal on a form prescribed for the purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this provision, the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
tax is com­puted on the "<u>actual market value</u> of the minerals or
mineral products extracted or produced from all mineral lands".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the assessment shall be
based, <u>not</u> upon the cost of production or extraction of said minerals or
mineral products, but on the price which the same - before or with­out
undergoing a process of manufacture - would command in the ordinary course of
business, that is to say, when of­fered for sale by one willing to sell, but
not under compulsion to sell, and purchased by another who is willing to buy,
but under no obligation to purchase.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, the third question must be settled in favor of
petitioner herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
cost of the paper bag container, in which the finished product or cement is
placed, for sale to the public, should not be in­cluded in the computation of
the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax and/or royalty
collectible by the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need not discuss the alleged impairment of the obli­gations
under petitioner's lease contract with the Government<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> -
involved in the fourth question - inasmuch as said contract is in conformity with
our interpretation of section 243 of the Tax Code, although not in accord with
that of respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be
understood, however, that the assessment shall be based on the <u>actual market
value</u> of the mineral products upon extraction thereof from the mines, <u>not</u>
on the cost of such extraction.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the surcharge of 25% included in the dis­puted
assessment, petitioner maintains that it is not liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
because it had acted in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
speci­fically, petitioner would have us believe that it merely did what it had
done "in the early part of 1957,” namely, pay­ing the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax "on the value of the minerals
extracted from its mines", to which - petitioner intimates - respond­ent
had seemingly acquiesced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Predicated
upon this premise, petitioner claims to have acted in good faith, because of
which - it concludes - it should not be required to pay the statutory surcharge
of 25%, or, the same should, at least, be reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the difference between the value of cement, as
finished product, and that of the minerals or raw materials extracted from its
mines is concerned, there can be no surcharge, for, as above stated, the
assessment of the 1-1/2% <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax
must be based on the value of said <u>raw</u> materials, upon extraction
thereof from the land, not on the value of the said <u>finished</u> product.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards, however, the difference between the <u>cost of
extraction</u> of said raw materials, upon which petitioner's returns were
based, and the <u>actual market value</u> of said raw materials, on which the
tax is due, petitioner can not claim good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the language of said section 243 of
the Tax Code is plain, clear and simple.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It explicitly declares that the tax shall be assessed and collected on
the "<u>actual market value</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> of the minerals and mineral products ex­tracted or
produced from all mineral lands." Petitioner has not even tried to show it
earnestly believed that "actual market value" and "cost of
production" or "cost of extraction" have identical connotations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is every reason to believe
that it knew the difference between the one and the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its own brief reveals that it had a correct
notion of the aforementioned provision of its lease contract with the Government,
which is substantially identical to the import of said section 243 of Tax Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, pursuant to the second paragraph of section 245 of
the same Code:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"In case the royalties
or <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes are not paid within
the period prescribed above, there shall be added thereto a surcharge of
twenty-five per centum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a false or
frau­dulent return is made, there shall be added to the royalties or <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes a surcharge of fifty per centum of
their amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surcharge so added
shall be collected in the same manner and as part of the royalties or <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> taxes, as the case may be."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The 25% surcharge thus prescribed for the late payment of the
royalties and the <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax, when
contrasted with the 50% surcharge impose "where a false or fraudulent
return is made," strongly suggests that <u>bad faith is not essential</u>
for the imposition of the 25% surcharge.</p>

<p class="BODY">This becomes more apparent when we consider that the surcharge is
increased to 50%, where the return is "false," a condition which may
exist without bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, if it
existed, the return would be, not merely "false," but, also
fraudulent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, said section 245 does not merely vest in respondent
the authority or discretion to impose the 25% surcharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is imposed <u>by law itself</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this res­pect, it is analogous to the 25%
surcharge prescribed for failure to pay the "percentage tax on any
business" within the time fixed by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the collection of which has been held to be mandatory and on which respondent
has no discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, petitioner is bound to pay the 1-1-1/2% <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax on the actual market value of the
minerals or mineral products extracted from its mines, with a 25% surcharge for
failure to make said payment within the prescribed time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence having been introduced, however,
on said actual market value, the records are hereby re­manded to the Court of
Tax Appeals, for the reception of evidence and further proceedings not
inconsistent with this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cost of this instance shall be borne by the petitioner, Republic Cement
Corporation.</p>
