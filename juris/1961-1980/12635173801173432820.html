of the decision and the two resolutions of the Court of Appeals promulgated on
May 10, July 23, and September 5, all in the year 1962, in G.R.-16497-R,
entitled “<span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> <span class="SpellE">MIguel</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Miguel, plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ana­cleta</span> M. <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de
Reyes, defendant-appellant."</p>

<p class="BODY">During the Spanish regime and prior to <st1:date year="1894" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1894</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel, then single and resident of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, went to <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> and
for some appreciable period of time stayed with his kins­man Juan Felipe in
barrio <span class="SpellE">Ingud</span> Norte, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Angadanan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There he spotted an uncultivated parcel of
land, one hectare of which he forthwith occupied, and then cleared and planted
to corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the Philippine <span style="">Revolution, </span>he returned to <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte and took a
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the early years of the ensuing
American regime, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel returned to <span class="SpellE">Ingud</span> Norte with his family, resettled on the same land,
cultivated and planted it to rice, declared it for tax­ation purposes, and paid
the annual realty taxes thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the year 1932, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes, an
ambulatory notary public and husband of the private respondent <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> <span style="">M. R</span>eyes,
<span style="">used to visit barrio <span class="SpellE">Ingud</span> Norte, looking for documents to notarize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel
became acquaintances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes asked Miguel if he wanted to secure
expeditiously a title to his landholding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having received an affirmative answer and after <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Mi­guel had handed to him the tax declaration and tax receipts covering the
land, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes prepared and filed a homestead
application in the name of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel and,
furthermore; promised to work for the early approval of the said
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reyes handed to Miguel the
receipt for the filing fee (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. A) corresponding to
the home­stead application, advising the latter to keep it, but he (Reyes) with­held
other papers including the tax declaration and tax receipts, as­suring Miguel
that he would return them as soon as the homestead patent was issued in
Miguel's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reyes likewise advised
Miguel to cease paying the land taxes until the patent shall have been issued
by the Bureau of Lands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After a long wait and
becoming impatient about the issuance of the promised title, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel inquired from <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
Reyes about the status of his application.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reyes promised to send a letter-tracer to the Bureau of Lands, and, in
fact, asked <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel to affix his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> to a blank paper upon which was supposed to be
written a letter-tracer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, World
War II broke out in the Pacific, and Miguel did not hear of and about his
homestead application; after the war he had no way of ascertaining the outcome
of his application be­cause <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes had died
meanwhile during the Japanese occupa­tion of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the services rendered
and still to be rendered by <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes in preparing
the homestead application and in securing the issuance of the correspondent
patent, Miguel gave the former 1/5 of his yearly harvest from the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the death of <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
Reyes, Miguel continued to deliver an equal number of <span class="SpellE">cavanes</span>
of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
widow, <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de
Reyes, who likewise pro­mised to help him secure the necessary homestead
patent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Miguel helped his father, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel, clear and cultivate the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in 1932, on the occasion of the marriage of <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel ceded to <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
14 hec­tares of the southern portion of the land as a gift <u>proper</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> forthwith declared the said portion for taxation
purposes in his name, as evidenced by tax declaration 7408 (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>.
G).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, unknown to <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Re­yes on </span><st1:date year="1935" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1935</span></st1:date><span style=""> filed sales application 20240 in the name of
his wife, <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Reyes (hereinafter referred to as the private respondent), covering the same
parcel of land occupied and cultivated by the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span>
and the subject of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel's homestead</span><span style=""> of</span><span style=""> </span>application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sales application was duly acknowledged
by the Bureau <span style="">of </span>Lands on <st1:date year="1935" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1935</st1:date>, and a sale at public
auction took place on <st1:date year="1939" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1939</st1:date>
whereat the private respondent was the sole bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Lands awarded the land to her
on <st1:date year="1940" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1940</st1:date>, the value
of which was to be paid on installments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1950, the private respondent had the land sur­veyed
by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Lorenzo who, in the course of the survey,
assured <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel that the land was being surveyed
in the latter's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondent, who was present during the survey, made the same assurance to <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, because his suspi­cions were aroused by the act of the private
respondent of having the land surveyed, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel
directed his son, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>, <span style="">to in­</span>quire from the office of the
district land officer of <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
about the status of his (<span class="SpellE">Eloy's</span>) homestead
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
dis­covered that their land was covered by the sales application of the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel forthwith filed on <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="2">February 16,
 1950</st1:date> a protest with the Bureau of Lands against sales application
20240 of the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, on <st1:date year="1950" day="21" month="2">February 21,
 1950</st1:date>, the Director of Lands ordered an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing of the protest was scheduled for <st1:date year="1950" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1950</st1:date> by deputy public lands
inspector Alejandro Ramos of Land District 4, Bureau of Lands, <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, but was
postponed at the instance of the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing was then reset for <st1:date year="1951" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1951</st1:date>, by assistant public
lands inspector <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span>
had in the interim discovered that notwithstanding their protest and the inves­tigation
ostensibly being conducted by the administrative branch of the Government,
sales patent V-522 and original certificate of title P-1433, covering the
parcel of land in question, were granted and issued to the private respondent
on <st1:date year="1951" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1951</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1951" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1951</st1:date>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, on <st1:date year="1951" day="17" month="2">February
 17, 1951</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Mi­guel lodged a complaint with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> against the private respondent, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">A</span>nacleta</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Reyes, the Director of Lands, and the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, for the annulment of
sales patent V-522 and the cancellation of original cer­tificate of title
P-1433.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case, docketed as civil
case 315 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
was dismissed by that court on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have
personality to institute the action, and that it was prematurely filed - the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span> not hav­ing exhausted all administrative remedies,
more specifically not appealing to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources from the grant by the Director of Lands of the patent to the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this Court, the
dismissal was affirmed on the second ground (G.R. L-4851, promulgated July 31,
1953).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 7, 1953, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Miguel com­menced the present action (civil case
616) in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>
against the private respondent to compel her to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
to them the land covered by the abovementioned pa­tent and title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the trial court found that
<span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel "has always been, and up to this
time, in physical posses­sion of the whole tract of land in question under
claim of ownership thru occupancy, he having occupied and cultivated the land
since the Spanish regime;” that he was a homestead applicant way back in 1932
for the land possessed by him; that there exists a trust re­lationship between
the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span> and the private respondent and her
deceased husband, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes, a notary public, with
respect to the same property, without which relationship <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel would himself have personally attended to his own application; and that,
through fraud and misrepresentations, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes
caused the filing and approval of an application and the issuance by the Bureau
of Lands of a sales patent covering the property in the name of his wife, the
private respondent, without the consent and knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
court, however, held that <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> is not proper
because the land in question is not the private property of the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span> since time immemorial but remains a part of the
public domain, and instead declared that <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel
"should be given priority to acquire the land under the homestead
provisions of the Public Land Law." Upon the foregoing premises, the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo </u>rendered judgment ordering (1) the Director of Lands to can­cel
patent V-522 issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Reyes, (2) the Registrar of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> to cancel original certificate of title P-1433 in
the name of <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Reyes and to re­turn Patent V-522 to the Bureau of Lands, and (3) the
Director of Lands to give due course to the homestead application of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Mi­guel over the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals
(hereafter referred to as the respondent Court) which dismissed the complaint
upon the ground that the judgment appealed from could not and did not bind the
Director of Lands and the Registrar of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>
who were not parties thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Deme­trio</span> Miguel
(hereafter referred to as the petitioners) filed a mo­tion for reconsideration,
wherein they argued that while the trial court might have incurred error in the
legal conclusions drawn from its own findings of fact, the respondent Court was
not legal­ly precluded by the Rules of Court and applicable jurisprudence to
modify the judgment of the trial court, so as to make it conform to the
evidence, and to grant the relief of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
sought in the action, in which action the Director of Lands and the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> are not proper or necessary
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mo­tion for reconsideration
was denied in an extended resolution of <span style="">the
respondent Court promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, which ruled that the petitioners should
have appealed from the decision of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second motion for reconsideration was
denied in a minute resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="9"><span style="">September 5, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are now before us on appeal by <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style="">, </span>assigning as errors (1) the Court of Appeals' holding that
they should have appealed from the decision of the trial court, and (2) its
finding that, assuming that <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in favor of
the peti­tioners as mere <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> is still proper,
the cases cited in the latter's first motion for reconsideration are not in
point.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been postulated - and, we think, correctly - that the
Supreme Court is vested with ample authority to review matters not assigned as
errors in an appeal, <span style="">if </span>it finds that their consideration and resolution are
indispensable or necessary in arriving at a just decision in a given case.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, before passing upon the foregoing assigned errors, we shall first resolve
<u>in</u> <u><span style="">seriatim</span></u><span style=""> </span>the matters raised in both the
appealed decision and resolutions of the respondent Court because to do so is
imperative in arriving at a fair and equitable adjudication of this case.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court
points up the failure of the peti­tioners to present a petition for judicial
confirmation of imperfect title, if they indeed had been in possession of the
land since <st1:date year="1894" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1894</st1:date>,
in accordance with the Public Land Act. <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel
should not, however, be expected to file such a petition because all along he
was relying on the solemn assurances of <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Re­yes
and later his wife, the private respondent, that they were in the process of
securing a homestead patent for him.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court
observed in its decision that the evidence on the allegation that <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes acted fraudulently in applying for the purchase
of the land and later transferring his right to his wife, is sharply
conflicting, and that even granting that there was fraud in the <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of the issuance of the patent, any objection
based on that ground should have been interposed within one year from the date
of its issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot give our approval to this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A</span>s found by the court below the petitioners,
have proven by preponderance of evi­dence the fraud perpetrated by the private
respondent and her hus­band on <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weight of evidence leans heavily <span style="">in </span>favor of the fact of occupation and
cultivation by <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel of the land from prior to <st1:date year="1894" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1894</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the finding of the lower court -
which belies the private respondent's allegation that <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel entered as her tenant only in 1935.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is also the receipt, <span class="SpellE">exh</span>. A, evidencing
the payment of a filing fee for a homestead applica­tion, which receipt, in the
possession of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel, raises at least the
presumption that he had filed a homestead application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the records of the Bureau of Lands or of
any of its units, par­ticularly the district land office at <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, do not show that such application was ever
filed, supports the petitioners' thesis, concurred in by the trial court, that
the blank paper which <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Mi­guel <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> at the behest of <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
Reyes was used by the latter to withdraw the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
application instead of to trace the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, there is the private respondent's
and her hus­band's act of misleading the Bureau of Lands by falsely stating in
their application for a sales patent that there was no improvement on the land,
when, as found by the lower court, the land had al­ready been cultivated and
improved by <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel since 1932, by the
latest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This misleading statement,
noted by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>on
<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 15 dated March 28, 1939 of the private
respondent, signi­ficantly, is not impugned by the latter.) In fact, the lower
court observed that the private respondent herself affirmed on the wit­ness
stand that <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel was in 1935 already working on
the land, although supposedly as her tenant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, at the time the private respondent's sales patent application
was filed in 1935, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes and she led the
Bureau of Lands to believe that the land was uncultivated and unoccupied by
other claimants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ve­ry relevant
question arises:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did the Reyes
spouses conceal from the Bureau of Lands the fact that the land was occupied
and being cultivated by the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span>, when there
existed no prohibition against having the land cultivated for them by
tenants?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are only two logical
reasons for the mysterious conduct of the Reyes spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, had they stated in their sales
application that the whole parcel of land was under cultivation by the
petitioners, the Director of Lands would have in all probability discovered
that the land applied for was covered by the prior homestead application of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel and most likely would have disapproved the
sales ap­plication of the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Second, had a survey of the land been conducted earlier, this would have
aroused the suspicions of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel earlier and
enabled him to discover much sooner the fraud perpetrated by <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes before the sales application of the private
respondent was given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the pri­vate respondent waited until she had just about paid all the install­ments
on the land before ordering a final survey thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was this survey which aroused <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel's suspicions and enabled him and his son to
discover the fraud perpetrated upon them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court's holding that any objection based on fraud
should have been interposed within one year from the <span style="">issuance of the sales patent, has no relevance to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an action for the <u>enforcement</u>
of a <u>constructive trust</u> - the ultimate object of which is the <span class="SpellE"><u>reconveyance</u></span> of property lost through breach of
fiduciary relations and/or fraud.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Therefore, it can be filed within four years
from the discovery of the fraud 23.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
since the petitioners discovered the fraud committed against them by the Reyes
spouses in 1950, they had until 1954 within which to bring this action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action was seasonably instituted because
the complaint was filed on </span><st1:date year="1953" day="7" month="9"><span style="">September 7, 1953</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court also
held that the only remedy avail­able at the time the action below was
instituted, was for the Govern­ment (through the Solicitor General) to file an
action for the rever­<span style="">sion o</span>f the
land to the public domain based on the illegality of the grant - a suit which a
private person is not authorized to file.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing rule is correct but inapplicable in this case, which, as
earlier mentioned, is an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a
piece of land through enforcement of a constructive trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this same rea­son, the provision of Land
Administrative Order 6 of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
cited in the respondent court's decision, is likewise inapt.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court
attributes error to the lower court's finding that <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel filed a homestead application for the land in question, stating that no
other evidence was presented to show that such application was filed except the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel and the receipt for the
filing fee of a homestead application; and that if such application was really
filed, some trace or tell-tale evidence of it would be extant, and the
application could have been easily re­constituted after the liberation in 1945
when the Government adopted a policy to enable all public land applicants to
reconstitute their ap­plications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
too well-settled to require any citation of authority that the lower court's
findings of fact are entitled to considerable weight, especially with respect
to the appreciation of the testimony of witnesses on the stand, since it was in
the best position to ob­serve the demeanor of the witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel regarding <span style="">his </span>filing of a
homestead application over the parcel of land - as found by the lower court -
should not therefore lightly be brushed aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The receipt, <span class="SpellE">exh</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A, for the filing of the homestead
application raises a presumption <span style="">in </span>favor
of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel's having filed such an
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier explained, if no
trace of the said application could be found among the records of the Bureau of
Lands or of any of its units, particularly the district land office at <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ilagan</span></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Isabela</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">it is because through
fraud – i.e., by asking <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel to <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> a blank piece of paper - <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
Reyes suc­ceeded in withdrawing the application of Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he did this to pave the way for his wife,
the private respondent herein, herself to apply for the land under a sales
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, having relied on
the assurances of the Reyes spouses that they would help him secure a homestead
patent, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel found no need to re­constitute
his homestead application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
even farfetched to suppose that Miguel, being illiterate, never even came to
learn of the Government's policy of enabling public land applicants to recons­titute
their applications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming now to the assigned
errors, the respondent Court's view is not correct that it cannot grant the
relief of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> <span style="">because the petitioners did not appeal from the decision of the low­er
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There exist sufficient bases,
hereinafter to be discussed, for the respondent Court to award said relief in
the exercise of its broad appellate powers to affirm, reverse or modify the
judgment or order appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, the petitioners cannot entirely be blamed if they thought
it the better part of prudence not to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For although it did not incorporate a decree of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
still the decision of the court below was favorable to them because it
vindicated their ac­tual possession of the land under a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
claim of ownership since the Spanish regime, and adjudged them as having a
better right to the land and the priority to own it under the Public Land
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span style="">it was their legitimate desire to avoid incurring additional expenses
incident to the bringing of an appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the Court of
Appeals, the petition­ers pointedly called the attention of the respondent
Court in their brief to several questions decided against them in the court
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, working on the theory that
it was plain error for the trial court to order the Director of Lands and the
Registrar of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> to implement its
decision, the petitioners called the atten­tion of the respondent Court to the
precise nature of the action be<span style="">low <span style="">in </span></span>which <span style="">the Director </span>of <span style="">Lands and the Register </span>of <span style="">Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isa­bela</span>
need not be <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">". . . <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></span>The

question which she has acquired through <span class="SpellE">fraudu­lend</span>

have been utterly improper for the plaintiffs to <span style="">have <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> the Director of Lands or the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> inasmuch as the action
is personal in na­ture directed against the person of the defendant."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners likewise
called the attention of the respon­dent Court to the trust relationship
existing between them, on one hand, and the Reyes spouses, on the other, which
was breached by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to
justify the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to them of the pro­perty,
they stated that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, a situation of trust has been created in the
instant case between the plaintiff and the defendant-appellant's deceased
husband upon whom the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel relied
through his (Reyes') representations that the correspond­ing title to said land
would be secured in favor of the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence likewise shows that
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Reyes promised the plaintiff to
continue the work began by her late husband with the ultimate result of securing
the said homestead patent and title in favor of the plain­tiff <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the said promise was violated by the defendant who secretly
worked to­ward the acquisition of the said land for her own self, fraudulently
and stealthily, no prescription can run as against plaintiffs' right to claim
owner­ship of the said property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We held in one case that appellants need not make specific
assignment of errors provided they discuss at length and assail in their brief the
correctness of the trial court's findings regarding the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said discussion warrants the appellate court
to rule upon the point because it substantially complies with sec. 7, Rule 51,
of the Revised Rules of Court, intended merely to compel the appellant to
specify the questions which he wants to raise and be disposed of in his
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>clear discussion regarding an error allegedly committed <span style="">by </span>the trial court accomplishes the
purpose of a particular assignment of error.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Here the petitioners (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the Court of
Appeals) stated quite explicitly in their brief that since the action was for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, it was utterly improper to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the Director of Lands and the Register of Deeds -
in ef­fect, calling the attention of the respondent Court to a plain error
committed by the trial court in ordering the Director of Lands and the Register
of Deeds to nullify the sales patent and original certi­ficate of title issued
to the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in
discussing the trust relationship between the <span class="SpellE">Miguels</span>
and the Reyes spouses which was breached by the latter, the petitioners (as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) al­so clearly brought to the attention of the
respondent Court a valid ground disregarded by the lower court as a basis for
granting the relief of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the Rules of
Courts</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and jurisprudence authorize a tribunal to

the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the lower court's decision
and addressed to the Director of Lands and the Register of Deeds, who were not
parties to the case, is a plain error which the respondent Court properly
corrected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As afore-narrated, the
petitioners (as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) brought this error to the
attention of the respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another plain error which the respondent Court should have considered
was the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style="">'</span>s<span style=""> </span>con­clusion that the land in litigation was still part of the
public do­main, in the face of the parties’ mutual allegations to the contrary
and despite the admitted fact that a sales patent and an original certificate
of title over the land had already been issued, thus se­gregating the land from
the public domain and making it private land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is noteworthy that the
complaint for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> was not dismissed by the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What it denied was merely
the relief or remedy of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in its decision, the trial court
made certain findings of fact which justified the relief of re-conveyance -
e.g., that <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel "has always been, and up
to this time, in physical possession of the whole tract of land in ques­tion
under claim of ownership thru occupancy, he having occupied and cultivated the
land since the Spanish regime;" that there was a trust relationship
between <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel and the Reyes spouses; and that
the Reyes spouses have fraudulently and in bad faith breached that trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in reiterating their positions before
the respon­dent Court on the private nature of the land, on the impropriety of</span>
<span class="SpellE">impleading</span> the Director of Lands and the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, and on the existence of a trust
relationship between the peti­tioners and the Reyes spouses, the petitioners
were in point of fact inviting the respondent Court's attention to questions
erroneously decided against them by the trial court, in the hope that the
respondent Court would render judgment in accordance with the facts ad­judged
by the trial court as proven.</p>

<blockquote>"If the complaint states a claim upon which any relief can be
given, it is immaterial what the plaintiff has asked for in his prayer or
whether he has asked for the proper relief; the court will grant him the relief
to which he is entitled under the facts proven" (Kansas City St. L. and
C.R. Co. v. Alton R. Co., 5 Fed. Rules Service, p. 638; <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.

Circuit, <st1:date year="1941" day="18" month="12">Dec. 18, 1941</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On appeal to the respondent Court by the
private respondent, the suit was, as it has always been in the court of origin,
one for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And of course, the petitioners did not ask the respon­dent Court for an
affirmative relief different from what was logical­ly justified by the facts
found by and proven in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court
opined that the cases cited by the petitioners in their motion for
reconsideration (<span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., Republic of the Philippines
v. Carle Heirs, L-12485, July 21, 1959, and <span class="SpellE">Roco</span>, et
al. <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Gimeda</span>,
L -11651, Dec. 27, 1958) are not applicable be­cause they involved properties
which admittedly belonged to the parties entitled to <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>,
unlike the herein petitioners who are mere public land applicants and have not
acquired title under the Public Land Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming the respondent Court to be correct, a legion of cases there are
which can be cited in favor of the peti­tioners position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the law of trust has been more
frequently applied in England and in the United States than it has been in
Spain, <span style="">we may </span>draw freely upon
American precedents in determining the effects of trusts, especially so because
the trusts known to American and English equity jurisprudence are derived from
the <span class="SpellE"><u>fidei</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>commissa</u></span>
of the Roman Law and are based entirely upon civil law principles.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, because the case presents problems not directly covered by
statutory provisions or by Spanish or local precedents, resort for their
solution must be had to the underlying principles of the law on the
subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, our Civil Code itself
directs the adoption of the principles of the general law of trusts, insofar as
they are not in conflict with said Code, the Code of Com­merce, the Rules of
Court and special laws.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In holding that the cases cited by the petitioners in their mo­tion
for reconsideration (<span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., Republic of the
Philippines v. Carle Heirs, <u>supra</u>, and <span class="SpellE">Roco</span>,
et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Gimeda</span>, <u>supra</u>) are inapplicable, the
respondent Court advances the theory that an action for <span class="SpellE">recon­veyance</span>
based on constructive trust will prosper only if the proper­ties involved
belong to the parties suing for and entitled to <span class="SpellE">reconvey­ance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not entirely accurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Fox v.

the plaintiff employed the defendant to assist him in obtaining oil leases in a
cer­tain locality in <st1:state><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:state>,
the former paying the latter a salary and his expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant acquired some leases for the
plaintiff and others for himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whereupon, the plaintiff brought suit to compel the defendant to assign
the leases which he had acquired for himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court found for the plaintiff, holding that it was a breach of the
defendant's fiduciary duty to purchase for himself the kind of property which
he was employed to purchase for the plaintiff.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be observed that in <u>Fox v. Simons</u>, <u>supra</u>,
the plain­tiff was not the original owner of the oil leases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely employ­ed the defendant to obtain
them for him, but the latter obtained some for the plaintiff and some for
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, despite the ab­sence of
this former-ownership circumstance, the court there did not hesitate to order
the defendant to assign or convey the leases he obtained for himself to the
plaintiff because of the breach of fi­duciary duty committed by said
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there need only be a
fiduciary relation and a breach of fiduciary duty before <span class="SpellE">recon­veyance</span>
may be adjudged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, a fiduciary
may even be charge­able as a constructive trustee of property which he
purchases for himself, even though he has not undertaken to purchase it for the
beneficiary, if in purchasing it he was improperly competing with the
beneficiary.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, a fiduciary relation arises where one man
assumes to act as agent for another and the other reposes confidence in him,
although there is no written contract or no contract at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the agent violates his duty as fiduciary,
a constructive trust ari­ses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
immaterial that there was no antecedent fiduciary relation and that it arose
contemporaneously with the particular transaction."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes, the
private respondent's husband, suggested that <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel file a homestead application over the land and offered his services in
assisting the latter to se­cure a homestead patent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel
accepted <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes' of­fer of services, thereby
relying on his word and reposing confi­dence in him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in payment for the services rendered by <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes in preparing and filing the homestead
application and those still to be rendered by him in securing the homestead
patent, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel delivered to Reyes 1/5 of his
yearly harvest from the said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes died, the petitioners continued to deliver the
same percentage of their annual harvest to the private respon­dent who
undertook to continue assisting the former to secure a homestead patent over
said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in breach of their
fidu­ciary duty and through fraud, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes and
the private respon­dent filed a sales application and obtained a sales patent
and ulti­mately an original certificate of title over the same parcel of
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, following the ruling in
<u>Fox v. Simons,</u> <u>supra</u>, the pri­vate respondent can be compelled to
<span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> or assign to the pe­titioners the parcel of
land in the proportion of nine hectares in favor of <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span>
Miguel and 14 hectares in favor of <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Miguel,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent argues that there is no violation of trust
relationship because the petitioners could have participated in the public
bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She avers that the alleged
fraud supposedly committed upon the petitioners, and on which the claim for <span class="SpellE">recon­veyance</span> is founded, is clearly of no moment because
the sales pa­tent in question was not the necessary consequence thereof, but
rather, it was granted in consideration of her being the highest bidder and the
purchaser of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In refutation of
the forego­ing argument, it must be observed, firstly, that the petitioners -
because of the fraud <span class="SpellE">practised</span> on them by the Reyes
spouses - ne­ver came to know about the public bidding in which the land was
offered for sale and therefore could not have participated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had not the Reyes spouses misrepresented in
their sales applica­tion that the land was uncultivated and unoccupied, the
Director of Lands would in all probability have found out about the occupancy
and cultivation of the said land by the petitioners and about <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel's homestead application over the same, and
consequently would have denied the sales application of the Reyes spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, it may justifiably be postulated
that equity will convert one who, for any reason recognized by courts of equity
as a ground for interference, has received legal title from the Government to
lands, which in equity and by the laws of Congress ought to have gone to
another, into a trustee for such other and compel him to convey the legal title
accordingly.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Thirdly, <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel could have very easily obtained
title to the said parcel of land in either of two ways, had he not been
inveigled by <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> Reyes to file a home­stead
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, since he is a
natural-born Filipino citizen, who is not an owner of more than twenty-four
hectares of land, and who since prior to July 4, 1926 (under R.A. 782, approved
June 21, 1952, occupation and cultivation since July 4, 1945, or prior thereto,
is deemed sufficient) has continuously occupied and cultivated a parcel of land
not more than twenty-four hectares in area, he was enti­tled to apply for a
free patent, for, or gratuitous grant, of said land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is known as confirmation of imperfect or
incomplete titles by administrative legalization.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Or, since <span class="SpellE">Eloy</span> Miguel has possessed the land prior to
July 26, 1894 and said possession has been continuous, uninterrupted, open,
adverse and in the concept of an owner, there is a presumption <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span> <u>et</u> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>
that all necessary conditions for a grant by the State have been complied with,
and he would have been by force of law entitled - pursuant to the provisions of
sec. 48(b) of the Public Land Act - to the registration of his title to the
land.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
