the Filipinos and evinced a sincere desire to learn and <span style="">embrace </span>the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipinos;
and that he has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications under

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After hearing the
testimony of two character </span><span style="">wit­nesses
</span><span style="">and partly that of the
petitioner himself, Judge <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span> was designated
vacation judge for </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> in </span>May 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 26, 1961, petitioner thru a new
counsel, retired Judge <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>,
filed an urgent motion praying that the case be set for hearing before any
branch of the court, for the taking of the testimony of the <span style="">last </span>witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was not presented to Judge <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span> for resolution, although he was still holding
sessions in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> at the time,
and, as a matter of fact, the case was scheduled for hearing the day following
the filing of the above motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion was approved by the Executive Judge Jesus Y Perez and the case was assigned
to Judge Agustin P. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>, who continued the
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the presentation of
testimonial and doc­umentary evidence, decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1961" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1961</st1:date>, by Judge <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> granting the petition to declare petitioner a
Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this decision
was received by the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="6">June
 8, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">No appeal was </span>taken from the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June </span>18, <span style="">1962, or one year and ten days after the </span>Promulgation
<span style="">of the decision, the Solicitor General
filed </span>a <span style="">motion to reopen the
case on the ground that the applicant had committed acts which clearly
demonstrates that he is a person of reproachable and reprehensible
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on said motion, Judge <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> issued on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, the following order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
there being no objection thereto on the part of the petitioner, who failed to
file his opposition thereto notwithstanding due notice, the Court finds the
motion to be well?<span style="">founded, and so
hereby grants the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
this Court granting this petition is hereby set aside and let this petition <span class="GramE">be</span> tried anew."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="7"><span style="">July 20,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner
filed a motion for reconsideration of and/or to set aside the above order, but
the same vas denied by the trial court, this time presided over by </span><span style="">Judge </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alvendia</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On motion of petitioner,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span> set the trial of the case anew for </span><st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="7"><span style="">July 9,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, on which date
Atty. </span>Jose <span style="">Omega moved to
withdraw the petition for naturalization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1963</st1:date>,
the trial court denied the peti­tion for naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues (1) that the lower court has no authority to
order the reopening of the case inasmuch as <span style="">the </span>judgment had become final; (2) that the finality of the
judgment precludes authority to render a second judgment; <span style="">and </span>(3) the lower court erred in
denying petitioner's application for naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the first procedural question, it may be stated
that judgment in naturalization cases will not become final until after the
certificate of naturalization is issued and after compliance with the
requirements of Section 1 of Republic Act No. 530.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in the case of <u><span style="">Rafael <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> v.
Republic</span></u><span style="">, </span>G. R. <span style="">No.</span></span><span style=""> </span>L-20375, <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1966</st1:date>, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> held that "under the law, a decision
granting an application for naturalization shall not become final and </span><span class="SpellE">executory</span> <span style="">until
after two years from the promulgation of the decision and after another hearing
is conducted to determine whether or not the applicant has complied with the
requirements of Section 1 of said law." (</span><u>See</u> <u><span style="">also</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> <span class="SpellE">Tsitung</span> v.
Republic, G. R. No. L-20819, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="2"><span style="">February 21, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">) </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>find no error committed by the lower court in<span style=""> </span>ordering the reopening of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second question, suffice it so say that it is
a well settled rule that a decision or order granting citizenship to the
applicant <span style="">does </span>not really become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and a naturalization proceeding not being a
judicial adversary proceeding, the decision rendered therein <span style="">is </span>not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> as to any of the reasons or matters
which should support a judgment canceling the certificate of naturalization for
illegal or fraudulent procurement. <span class="GramE">(Republic v. Bon Lee, G.
R. <span style="">No.</span></span><span style=""> </span>L-11499, <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1961</st1:date>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the petition, the office of the Solicitor General
presented Exhibit 2 containing the complaints filed against petitioner in the
office of the city fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
in the Court of First Instance of Manila, and in the Manila Police
Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the petitioner has two cases of falsi­fication of public and commercial
document, violation of the Bulk Sales Law and <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of these criminal cases were dropped
provisionally and the other two were definitely dropped by the investigating
fiscals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Manila Police
Department, the petitioner has the following records:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>driving against one way and dis­regarding
traffic signs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases, he <span style="">was </span>warned by the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this
appeal, the government gave information that the petitioner maintained a
paramour by whom he had six (6) children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is<span style=""> </span>submitted certified <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">photostatic</span></span> copies of the birth
certificates of the children, which, notwithstanding due notice to him, the
petitioner failed to explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
repeatedly held that by such conduct, petitioner shows lack of good moral <span style="">character. </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
