from <span style="">the decision of the Court </span>of
First Instance of Manila, in Naturalization Case No. 48376, granting the
petition for naturalization of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">On August 17, 1961, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Siao</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> filed with the
Court of First Instance of Manila, a petition for naturalization,
alleging:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that he was born on the 26th
day of May, 1936, in <span class="SpellE">Kulangsu</span>, China; that he
emigrated to the Philippines from Amoy, China, on or <span style="">about the 9th day of February 1939, and arrived at </span>the port of
Manila, Philippines, on board the vessel "<span class="SpellE">Tjinegara</span>";
that he has resided continuously in the Philippines for a period of over 20
years, and in the City of Manila for a period <span style="">of </span>at least one year, immediately preceding the date of his
petition, and that his present, place of residence is No. 921, now 1171,
Magdalena Street, City of Manila, and his former places of residence were at <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> Street, T. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pinpin</span></span><span style=""> Street, and </span>631
<span class="SpellE">Zacateros</span> Street, Manila; that he <span style="">is </span>single; that his trade or
profession <span style="">is </span>that of <span style="">an </span>employee, in which he has been
engaged since 1957, and from which he derives an average annual income of
P3,600.00; that he does not own any real estate; that he is able to speak and
write English and <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; that he has filed his
declaration of intention on March 2, 1960; that he believes in the principles
underlying the Philippine Constitution, he has conducted himself in a proper
and irreparable manner during the entire period of his residence in the
Philippines in his relation with the constituted government as well as with the
community in which he lives, has mingled socially with the Filipinos, and has
evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace the customs, traditions and
ideals of the Filipinos; that he has all the qualifications required under
Section 2, and none <span style="">or </span>the
disqualifications under Section 4, or Commonwealth Act No. 473; that he is not
opposed to organized govern足ment, nor is he affiliated with any association or
group of persons that uphold and teach doctrines op足posing all organized
governments, nor is he defending or teaching the necessity or propriety of
violence, personal assault or assassination for the <span style="">success </span>and predominance of men's
ideas; that he is not a polygamist nor a believer in the practice of polygamy;
that<span style=""> he has not been convicted of any
crime involving moral turpitude, nor is he suffering from any incurable con足tagious
disease; that the nation of which he is a citizen or subject is not at war with
the Philippines; that it is his intention in good faith to become a citizen of
the Philippines, and to renounce absolutely and forever ail allegiance and
fidelity to any foreign prince, <span class="SpellE">potentiate</span>, state or
sovereignty, and, particularly, to the Republic of China; that </span><span style="">he will </span><span style="">reside continuously in the Philippines from the date of the filing of
his petition until the time of his admission to Philippine citizenship; and
that he has not made any application for citizenship in any court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was accompanied by two amended affidavits
executed by Mauro N. Castro and Vicente Merced, and another affida</span>vit
executed by Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Semeniano</span>, all of <span style="">whom </span><span style="">uniform</span>ly declared that they have <span style="">always </span>known the petitioner to be a
man of honor and good reputation; that they have known him for more than ten
years, and that during the period of their acquaintance with him they have
observed him conduct himself in an irreproachable manner in his relation to the
constituted authorities, <span style="">to the community where he lived, and to his acquaintances and friends;
and that the petitioner has, in their opinion, all the qualifications necessary
to become a citizen </span>of the Philippines, and not in any way disqua足lified
under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The petition was duly published as
required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
filed an opposition to the petition, based on various grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">After
due hearing, the Court of First Instance of Manila, on February 3, 1964,
rendered a decision granting the petition, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">ordering that the
corresponding</span> certificate or naturalization be issued in favor of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siao</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> upon compliance by him of the requirements provided
in Republic Act No. 530.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In due time the Solicitor General
appealed from the decision of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">In his appeal before this Court, the
Solicitor General contends that the lower court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in finding that the petitioner has a
lucrative income or occupation; (2) in not finding that the character witnesses
of the petitioner are not credible persons within the meaning of the law; (3)
in finding that the petitioner <span style="">is </span>of good moral character; and, as a
corollary to these contentions, (4) in granting the petition for
naturalization.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in his
effort to prove that he has a lucrative income, sufficient to meet the
requirements for naturalization, introduced in evidence his income tax returns
for the years 1959, 1960, 1961, and 1962, showing that he had the following
income:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that during the <span style="">hearing </span>of the petition petitioner tried to prove that <span style="">his income </span>was
higher than what he had <span style="">previously
stated in his peti</span>tion,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
by declaring that <span style="">his income was </span>P480.00
a month.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
We find, however, that petitioner's claim is belied by his own evidence
consisting of his personal income tax returns for the years 1959, 1960, 1961
and 1962<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and the verified certificate issued by his employer, <span class="SpellE">Leheon</span>
Textile Co., dated June 18, 1962, where足in the amounts stated as the earnings
of petitioner do not tally with his claim during the hearing of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We noted that petitioner himself contradicted
the statement in the certificate issued by <span class="SpellE">Leheon</span>
Textile Co., when he declared on cross-examination that he started to work with
<span class="SpellE">Leheon</span> Textile Company in February 1963<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
whereas in the certificate, dated June 18, 1962, <span style="">it is </span>stated that as of that date he was emplo<span style="">y</span>ed in that textile company at a
salary of P400.00 a month.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
These <span style="">discrepancies in </span>the
testimony of petitioner and his documentary evidence cannot but give the
impression that petitioner was not telling the truth regarding his income, and
do not speak well of him who <span style="">is </span>supposed
to be a person of good moral character and irreproachable conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find that in
the year 1960, petitioner reported in his income tax return an annual income of
P800.00 only, while in the subsequent year, 1961, his income abruptly increased
to P3,450.00, or an increase of more than 300%.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is another circumstance that gives the impression that the reported
income was deli足berately "intended to cure the deficiency for purposes<span style=""> of naturalization."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The income to be reckoned with in determining
whether the applicant for naturalization has a lucrative income <span style="">is </span>that "as of the time or the
filing of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">application"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, and granting that <span style="">petitioner's average annual income as </span>of the time he filed his
petition was P3<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>, the same cannot be considered
lucrative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has already held
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">"an income </span></span><span style="">or </span><span style="">P350.00 </span><span style="">a
month these days <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">to be considered lucrative considering </span>the
</span><span style="">high </span><span style="">cost <span style="">of
living </span>not only in the cities but in the province as well."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And so an annual income of P3<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>, which means P300.00 monthly, cannot be considered
lucrative for the purposes </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">qualifying for naturalization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding the second
error assigned, the Solicitor General urges that the character witnesses of the
petitioner are not credible as contemplated in the Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Naturalization Law requires that the
petition for naturalization must be supported by the testimonies of credible
persons, and so there is no presumption in favor of the credibility of
witnesses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The credibility of witnesses
must be shown as a fact.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the Naturalization <span style="">Law,
</span>a <u><span style="">credible person</span></u><span style=""> </span>is not simply an individual who has
not been previously convicted or a crime, or not <span style="">a </span>police character, or has no police
record, or who has not perjured in the past, or whose sworn statement or
testimony is not incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What must
be <span class="GramE"><u><span style="">credible,</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">is </span>not necessarily the declaration made, but the person making
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This implies that such person has a
good standing in the community; that he is known to be honest and upright; that
he <span style="">is </span>reputed to be trustworthy
and reliable; and that his word may be taken on its face value as <span style="">a good warranty of the worthiness of the
petitioner.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is not shown in the record that the
character witnesses </span>or <span style="">the
petitioner are persons of good standing in the community, and that they are
honest and upright, or are reputed to be trustworthy and reliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="GramE">We</span> have
noted that the acquaintance of the witnesses with the petitioner is limited,
such that their testimonies would not serve to satisfactorily establish that
petitioner has conducted himself in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">proper and irreproachable manner during the entire period of his
residence in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Witness Vicente de la Merced, among other things, testified that during
a period of six years he saw the petitioner "May be five or six or eight
times."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Likewise, the other witness, Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Semeniano</span>, testified, on direct examination, that he came
to know the petitioner in 1948 in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Tabora</span> street</st1:address></st1:street>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, on cross-examination, this witness
admitted that from Grade I to Grade VI he studied in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>, and that he finished his grade VI in
1951.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It appears doubtful that in the year 1948 this witness was in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and had then associated with the petitioner. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Granting that the witness actually knew
petitioner since 1948, it could be that their meetings occurred only during
school vacation from the year 1948 to 1951, because the witness admitted that
he studied his grades I to VI in <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, and he
finished his grade VI in 1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
meetings of petitioner and witness <span class="SpellE">Semeniano</span>, it ever
there had been, were only occasional.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such occasional meetings are not sufficient to enable him to observe
closely petitioners behavior so as to be competent to testify regarding his
good moral character and irreproachable conduct during the entire period of
petitioner's residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip足pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>3. The Solicitor General also contends that the evidence to
establish that petitioner is of good moral character was not sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Semeniano</span>
failed to show, by his testimony, that petitioner<span style=""> </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">of good moral character, because he simply dec<span style="">lared that petitioner has not entered illegitimate transaction </span>a<span style="">nd has</span> <span style="">not been </span></span>put <span style="">in </span><span style="">jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">This </span></span><span style="">character </span><span style="">witness did </span><span style="">nor state specific facts and events from

takes more than the <span style="">uncorroborated

</span><span style="">and
association </span><span style="">with petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can safely be
