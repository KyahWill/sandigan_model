motion filed by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> and <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>,
Josefina B. Jimenez, praying for an order of this court requiring the Branch

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case show that the spouses Leonardo
Jimenez and Corazon Benito are registered owners of a parcel of land containing
618 square meters, more or less, with improvements thereon, located at <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, covered by
Original Certificate of Title No. 14483-Pangasinan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 16 January and <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="7">28 July 1958</st1:date>, the said spouses mortgaged the said
property to the DBP for P15,000 and P2,000, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgages were duly registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="3">25
 March 1966</st1:date>, the same property was sold at a public auction in an
extra-judicial foreclosure sale, due to the mortgagors' inability to pay the
amortiza­tions on said loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
bidder at the public auction was the mortgagee itself, the DBP, represented by
its Branch Attorney, and which paid P11,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1967, the mortgagors sold their said registered land,
including the right of redemption to their daughter and <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>

Jimenez paid to the Provincial Sheriff the amount of P11,000 re­presenting the
redemption price, plus </span>P1,320 <span style="">as
legal interest up to </span><st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="3"><span style="">27 March 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, or a total of P12,320.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Sheriff then executed a Deed
of Redemption in her favor after which she presented the same <span style="">to the </span>Register of Deeds for
registration, annotation in the <span style="">owner’s
duplicate copy </span>of the title, and to secure a Transfer Certifi­<span style="">cate of Title in her own </span>name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Deed of Redemption was entered (Entry No.
270696) in the Register of Deeds' Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in view of <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> repeated refusal to
deliver to the Register of Deeds the said owner's copy of the title, the
annotation of the redemption and the can­cellation of the title could not </span>be
<span style="">made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="4">1 April 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> filed an <u>Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span></u>
Motion with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
praying that the Court issue an order for the DBP Branch Manager to cause the
delivery of the afore­said copy of the title to the Register of Deed. The <u>Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span></u> Motion was granted by the lower court in its
order of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="4">1 April 1967</st1:date>, <u>supra</u>,
copy of which was received by the DBP on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="4">5
 April 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 7 April 1967,
the DBP filed an <u>Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span></u> Urgent Motion
requesting for the extension of time within which to comply with the order of 1
April 1967, expressing at the same time its desire to be heard and to file a
Motion for Reconsideration thereof, On 7 April 1967, the court issued an order
giving the DBP 10 days from 10 April 1967 within which to comply with the order
of 1 April 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 20 April 1967, the
last day of the extension, the DBP filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the
paid court orders of 1 April and 7 April 1967, contesting the validity of the
Deed of Redemption on the grounds that (a) the Provincial Sheriff had no
authority to execute the said Deed, and (b) the redemption price was
inadequate, contending that it should be the Bank's total claim and interest on
the date of sale, which was P32,020.57 as of 27 March 1967, which should be
paid and not merely P12,320.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 25 April
1967, the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> filed an Opposition to the
Motion for Reconsideration, alleging that the Provincial Sheriff had full
authority to execute the Deed of Redemption under Section 23, Rule 39, of the
Rules of Court, and reiterating its previous prayer that the DBP produce the
owner's copy of the title, in compliance with the court orders of 1 and 7 April
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="5">12 May 1967</st1:date>, the DBP filed a Reply to the Opposition to
Motion for Reconsideration and on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="8">14
 August 1967</st1:date>, the court issued an Order denying the Motion for
Reconsideration of <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="4">20 April 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The errors assigned by
appellant DBP are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

foreclosed by the DBP such as the land covered by OCT <span style="">No. </span>14483 and in denying the <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> Motion for Reconsideration of the Order of April 1,
1967.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The DBP charges that the lower court committed a reversible error
<span style="">when it </span>issued its order of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="4">1 April 1967</st1:date>, directing the Bank
officials to surrender the owner's copy of OCT No.14483 to the Register of

without complying with Section 111,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Act No. 496.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the contention of the mortgagee-Bank that the <span class="SpellE">re­demptioner</span>
should have applied to the court by petition instead of mere <u>Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span></u> Motion and that a hearing should have been had to
enable said Bank to interpose its objections to the surrender and consequent
cancellation of the owner's duplicate copy of the cer­tificate of title in its
possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> merely filed an <u>Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span></u>
Motion </span>on the basis of which the court issued the order of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="4">1 April 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, that procedural defect was cured
when the DBP presented its Motion for Reconsideration of the said orders of 1
April and <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="4">7 April 1967</st1:date>,
contesting the validity of the Deed of Redemption on grounds discussed
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the court, therefore,
overruled the <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> said objections and arguments and
affirmed its previous orders, the DBP was given its day in court, and the
objection of lack of notice or opportunity to be heard is overcome.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised in the second assignment of error was already
resolved in the case of <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, et al. vs. The
Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (now the DBP)<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
when this court held in effect that Section 31 of Commonwealth Act No. 459<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,

estate mortgaged to the DBP to secure </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the redemption price to be paid by
the mortgagor or debtor to the DBP is "all the amount he owes the latter
on the date of the sale, with interest on the total indebtedness at the rate
agreed upon", and not merely the amount paid for by the purchaser at the </span>public
auction, pursuant to Section 26, Rule 39, of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The pertinent portion of the decision in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Nepomuceno</u></span>
case follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the cursory reading of the foregoing provisions it would
appear that Section 26, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which is referred to as a
complimentary provision of Section 6 of Act 3135, is wider in scope than
Section 31 of Commonwealth Act 459.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first embraces all properties mortgaged in favor of <u>any person</u> as
mortgagee while the latter merely relates to properties mortgaged to the Agri<span style="">cultural and Industrial Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, Section 26, Rule 39,
operates on every mortgaged property in the hands of any mortgagee that comes<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> within the purview of Act 3135 </span><u><span style="">whereas Section 31 of Commonwealth Act 459
operates </span></u><u><span style="">only on proper</span></u><span style="">ties mortgaged to the Rehabilitation Finance
Corporation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It thus appears that Common­wealth Act No.
459 is a special law exclusively </span><span style="">applicable </span><span style="">to properties mortgaged to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation,
while Act 3135, as im­plemented by Section 26, Rule 39, is a general law which
embraces </span><span style="">all </span><span style="">properties mortgaged to any party to the
exclusion of said corporation as mortgagee. Therefore, under the familiar rule
that a special law should prevail over a general law when the application of
their provisions should conflict on a particular transaction, we cannot but
conclude that the law that should apply to the redemption of the foreclosed
property is Commonwealth Act No. 459."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The paramount reason given by this Court
in the above interpretation is "to protect the investment of the
government in the institution".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
can <span style="">readily </span>be <span style="">seen in this </span>case that if the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> were allowed to redeem the <span style="">property by </span>merely paying the DBP the
purchase price at the <span style="">auction sale with
</span>interest, or a total of P12,320, the DBP would lose <span style="">P18,239.37 at least </span>as of the date of
the sale, considering that its <span style="">total
claim of principal, </span>interest and publication expenses on said date <span style="">already amounted to </span>P30,559.37.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The ruling that </span>Section
31 of Commonwealth Act No. 459 governs <span style="">the
redemption </span>of real properties mortgaged <span style="">to the </span>DBP has likewise been <span style="">reiterated
in the more recent case of <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span> vs. Development

<blockquote>"It may not be amiss to note that, unlike Section 30 of Rule
39 of the Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>,
which permits the extension of the period of redemption of mortgaged properties
Section 3<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

<u><span style="">which governs </span></u><u><span style="">the redemption of property mortgaged to the
Bank, does not contain a sim­ilar </span></u><u><span style="">provision</span></u><span style="">." </span><span style="">(Underscoring supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Referring to a similar provision in the Charter of the Philippine
National Bank, this Court ruled in Medina vs. Philippine National Bank, <span style="">56 Phil. 651, at </span>pages 656-657:</p>

<blockquote>"When the bank's right to foreclose the mortgage of the Manila
Commercial Com­pany accrued, Act No. 3135 was already in force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, this law, being general, did not
affect the charter of the bank, which was a special law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the bank, in order to sell the
mortgaged property <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>, resorted to Act
No. 3135, it did so merely <span style="">to find </span>a
proceeding for the sale; but that action cannot be taken to mean a waiver of
its right to demand the payment of the whole debt before the property can be
redeemed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record contains nothing to
show that the bank made this waiver of said right."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nothing in Register of Deeds of Iloilo vs. Hodges, L-18178, <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1">31 January 1963</st1:date>, 7 SCRA, 149,

vs. Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, <span class="SpellE">Sumerariz</span> vs.
Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city> vs. Philippine National
Bank, previously quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sole issue
involved in the Hodges case was whether a Court of First Instance, sitting as
land registration court, could validly act on a petition to cancel entries
appearing in a certificate of title if there was a serious opposition to the
petition, and We ruled that the court could not do so under Section 112 of Act
496, since contro­versial matters must be settled in ordinary actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any reference in said Hodges decision to Section
26 of Commonwealth Act No. 459, or to Section 9 of Republic Act No. 89, was
beside the issue raised and, there­fore, mere obiter without binding effect.</p>

"Section 31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagor or
debtor to the Agricultural and Indus­trial Bank, whose real property has been
sold at public auction, judicially or extra-judicially for the full or partial
payment of an obligation to said Bank, shall, within one year from the date of
the auction sale, have the right to redeem the real property by paying to the
Bank all the amount he owed the latter on the date of the sale, with interest
on the total indebted­ness at the rate agreed upon in the obligation from said
date, unless the bidder has taken material possession of the property or unless
this had been delivered to him, in which case the proceeds of the property
shall compensate the interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Agricultural and Industrial Bank was not the highest bidder at the auction
sale, the Bank shall, in case of redemp­tion, return to the bidder the amount
it received from him as a result of the auction sale with the corresponding
interest paid by the debtor." (Effective 9 June 1939)</p>
