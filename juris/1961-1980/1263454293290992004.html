				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal by certiorari to review the reso­lution of<span style=""> </span>the Land Registration Commissioner,
dated August 25, 1964 - ordering the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
to deny registration of the Deed of Sale and the Affidavit of Consolidation of
Ownership presented to him by herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main issue is, whether or not the period
of redemption of properties sold at public auction pursuant to an<span style=""> </span>extrajudicial foreclosure of real
estate mortgage under Act No. 3135, <span style="">as
</span>amended <span style="color: windowtext;">by Act
No. 4118, <span style="">is </span>to be counted from
the date of the execution of the certificate of sale by the sheriff, or, from
the date of registration of the corresponding certificate of sale issued by the
sheriff in the Office of the Register of Deeds concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For purposes of disclosing the law question involved, the
following statement of facts lifted from the resolution appealed from will
suffice:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears from the facts of record that the spouses Leonardo
<span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span> and Aurora L. <span class="SpellE">Cariaga</span>
are the registered owners of the properties covered by Transfer Cer­tificates
of Titles Nos. 18230, 18231, 18232, 18233 and 18234, of the Registry of Deeds
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These properties were mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank and upon
the failure of the mort­gagors to pay the amount of the indebtedness upon <span class="GramE">maturity,</span> the mortgage was foreclosed <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
under the provisions of Act No. 3135, as amended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1963</st1:date>,
the mort­gaged properties were sold at pub­lic auction by the Provincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,010.00</span>
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Re­yes, the highest bidder, and
the corresponding certificate of sale was issued by the sheriff on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said certificate, the expiration date of
the period of redemption was fixed by the sheriff to be ‘one (1) year from and
after the date of the sale.’ It should be noted in this connection, that the
duplicate of the certificate of sale was not filed (registered) by the sheriff
in the office of the Register of Deeds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A copy thereof which was attached to the Affidavit of Consolidation of
Ownership as a sup­porting <span class="GramE">paper,</span> was neither entered
in the Primary Entry Book for Act 496.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1964</st1:date>,
there were presented for registration in the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, an Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership executed
on <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1964</st1:date>, by the
auction-vendee, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes, and a Deed of Sale
executed by the Phil­ippine National Bank as attorney-in­-fact of the mortgagee
(sic), in favor of the auction-vendee, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Register of Deeds denied the registration of the above-mentioned
documents on the ground that the pe­riod of redemption has not yet ex­pired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of his opinion on the matter, the
Register of Deeds in­voked the doctrine laid by the Supreme Court in the case
of Salazar v. <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>, G. R. No. L-15378, promul­gated
on July 31, 1963, wherein it was held that the rule that the pe­riod of
redemption in execution sales pursuant to Section 26 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court, which be­gins to run not from the date of sale but from the date of
registra­tion of the certificate of sale, is also applicable in extrajudicial
foreclosure sales of registered land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Claiming that Section 6 of Act 3135, as amended, is so clear
on the point that the redemption period shall begin to run from the date of
sale, the petitioner, thru his coun­sel, disagreed with the ruling of the
Register of Deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
this appeal."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the opening paragraph of this opinion, the Land
Registration Commissioner, upon the foregoing premises, promulgated the
resolution appealed from, or­dering the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to deny the regis­tration of the Deed of Sale
executed by the mortgagee and the Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership execu­ted
by the auction-vendee, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Reyes, who presented
the said documents for registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for <span style="">reconsideration </span>of
the resolution was subsequently denied <span style="">by
</span>the Land Registration Commissioner, hence, the instant petition for
review.<i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the theory of petitioner that in sales of property at
public auction pursuant to an extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage
under Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, the period of redemption should
be reckoned from the date of the auction sale which, he contends, is the
express man­date of Section 6 of Act No. 3135:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 6.</span> In all cases in which the
extrajudicial sale is made under the special power hereinbefore referred to,
the debtor, his successors in-interest, or any judicial creditor or judgment
creditor of said debtor, or any person having a lien on the property subsequent
to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the pro­perty <span style="">is </span>sold, <u>may
redeem the same at any time within the term of one year </u><u><span style="color: windowtext;">from
and after the date of sale</span></u><span style="color: windowtext;">; and such redemption shall be
governed by the provisions of sections 464 to 466, inclusive, of the Code of
Civil Procedure, insofar as these are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Act."</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Land Registration Commiss­ioner is of the
opinion that the above-quoted provision is not the only pertinent and
controlling law on the matter, <span class="GramE">specially</span> when it is
taken into consideration that the land involved is registered land under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He maintains, and so held in the
reso­lution appealed from, that Section 6 of Act 3135 should be applied to the
present case together with:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) sections
30 to 35 of Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court with regard to redemption;
(2) Section 27, Rule 39 of the said Rules and Section 71 of Act 496 with regard
to the filing (registration) of the sheriff's certificate of sale; and (3) Section
50 of Act 496, with regard to<span style="color: windowtext;">
the registration of the certificate of </span><span style="color: windowtext;">sale
so as to </span><span style="color: windowtext;">consider
the land conveyed and affected under the Land Registration Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling of the Land Registration Commissioner must be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 27, Rule 39 of the
Revised Rules of Court provides that the certificate of sale executed by the
sheriff in a public auction sale must be filed (registered) in the Office of
the Register of <span style="color: windowtext;">Deeds
of the province where the land is situated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This </span><span style="color: windowtext;">is </span><span style="color: windowtext;">a mandatory requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to regis­ter the certificate of sale
violates the said pro­vision of law and, construed in relation with Sec­tion 50
of the Land Registration Law (Act 496), shall not take effect as </span><span style="color: windowtext;">a </span><span style="color: windowtext;">conveyance or bind the land
covered by a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">torrens</span></span> title
because "the act of registration is the operative act to convey and affect
the land." So the redemption period, for purposes of determining the time
when a final deed of sale may be executed or issued and the ownership of the
registered land consolidated in the purchaser at an extrajudicial foreclosure
sale under Act 3135, should be reckoned from the date of registration of the
certificate of sale in the office of the regis­ter of deeds concerned and not
from the date of the public auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this effect is the holding in the case of Ernesto Salazar v. <span class="SpellE">Flor</span> de <span class="SpellE">Lis</span> <span class="SpellE">Mene­ses</span>,
L-15378, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7"><span class="GramE"><span style="color: windowtext;">July</span></span><span style="color: windowtext;"> 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">, where this Court ex­plained
at length this principle, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The issue decisive of this appeal is the one raised by the
appellant in their third assignment of error, which is to this effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the lo­wer court erred in not holding
that the period of redemption in this case, <u><span style="color: windowtext;">as far as appellants are
concerned</span></u><span style="color: windowtext;">, started only on May 26, 1956, the date when the
certificate of sale issued by the sheriff was registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should we rule to this effect, it is clear
that when the appellants attempted to exercise their right to redeem, as judg­ment
creditors of the deceased mort­gagor by judgment subsequent to the
extrajudicial foreclosure sale, and when they instituted the present act­ion on
</span><st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="10"><span style="color: windowtext;">October</span><i style=""><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span></i><span style="color: windowtext;">1, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="color: windowtext;">,
the period of redemption had not yet <span class="GramE">expired.</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"We </span>find
appellants’ contention to be meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Agbu<span style="">los</span></span><span style=""> v. Alberto, G. </span><span style="">R. No.</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">L-17483,
pro­mulgated on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, we held:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The property involved in the present case <span style="">is </span>registered land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the law in this jurisdic­tion that when property brought under the operation of
the Land Registration Act <span style="">is <span style="">sold, </span></span>the operative act is the
regis­tration of the deed of conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The deed of sale does not ‘take effect as a conveyance, or bind the
land’ until it is registered (Sec­tion 50, Act 496; <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, 28 Phil. 635; <span class="SpellE">Sika<span style="">tuna</span></span><span style=""> v. </span><span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, 43 Phil. 371; Worcester
v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, 34 Phil. 646).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, to be in consonance with this
well settled rule, Section 24, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, provides that the
duplicate of the certificate of sale given by the sheriff who made the auction
sale to the purchaser must be filed (registered) in the office of the register
of deeds of the province where the property is situated.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">‘In Garcia v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
G.R. No.</span> L-13029, <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1959</st1:date>,
we held that the twelve months period of redemption provided for in Sec. 26,
Rule <span style="">39 </span>of
the Rules of Court "begins to run not from the date of sale, but from the
time of the registration of the sale in the office of the reg<span style="">i</span>ster of
deeds." The entry or annotation on the back of the certificate of <span style="">title </span>of the property in question on <span style="">July 18, 1959 (supra) was in </span>accordance
with this ruling when it provided that the execution sale was “subject to <span style="">redemption within one year from registration </span>hereof."</p>

<p class="2Q">‘A case similar to the pre­sent is that of <span style="">Gonzales et </span>al <span style="">v. </span><span style="">Philippine National Bank et al. </span>48
Phil. 824, where we held that the provision of Section 32, Act 2938 (Charter of
the Philippine National B<span style="">ank) providing
</span>for a <span style="color: windowtext;">right of
redemption in favor of the bank’s mortgagor "within one year from the sale
of the real estate as a result of the foreclosure" should be construed to
mean one year after the confirmation of the foreclosure sale, because the sale
becomes va­lid only after the confirmation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Along the same line we may say in this case that the period of one year </span><u><span style="color: windowtext;">after</span></u><u><span style="color: windowtext;"> the sale</span></u><span style="color: windowtext;"> must likewise start only
from the date of registration of the certificate of sale, because it is only
when that the certificate takes "effect as a conveyance" in
accordance with Act 496.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The above ruling is squarely appli­cable to the present case
which in­volves also registered land, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the
fact that the sale in question is not an execution sale but a foreclosure
sale."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But it is further argued by the petitioner that the rule should
not be applied to this case where there are no third parties involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cites a num­ber of authorities,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that as between the parties, registration is not necessary to
bind the immediate parties to a transaction involving regist­ered land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would then conclude that since the only
purpose of registration is to protect the buyer from third party claims, it
stands to reason that when, as in this case, there are no third party claimants
to the land, registration is not necessary and the sale between the parties
should be made to take effect from the date of the auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not impressed by the argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, herein petitioner failed to see
the "other side of the coin" and overlooked the doctrine, also well
settled, that the registration required by Section 50 of the Land Registration
Law <span style="">is </span>intended primarily for
the protection of innocent third persons, i.e., persons who, without knowledge
of the sale and in good faith, have acquired rights to <span style="color: windowtext;">the
property.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="color: windowtext;"> The same protection to third parties is obviously one
of the objects of Section 27, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court in
requiring that the certificate of sale issued by the sheriff in an auction sale
be registered in the office of the register of deeds, for the purpose of the
legislature in providing for our present system of registration is to afford
some means of publicity so that persons dealing with real property may reach
the records and thereby acquire security against instruments the execution of
which has not been revealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Redemption
is not the concern merely of the auction-vendee and the mortgagor, but also of
the latter’s successors in interest or any judicial creditor or judgment
creditor of said mortgagor, or any person having </span><span style="color: windowtext;">a </span><span style="color: windowtext;">lien on the
property subsequent to the mortgage under which the property has been
sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is precisely for this reason
that the certificate </span><span style="color: windowtext;">of
</span><span style="color: windowtext;">sale should be registered, for only upon
such registration may it legally be said that proper notice, though
constructive, has been served unto possible <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>
contemplated in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to
conclude, there­fore, that the date of sale mentioned in Section 6 of Act 3135,
as amended, should be construed to mean the date of registration of the
certificate of sale in the office of the register of deeds concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only after the lapse of the twelve-month
redemption period from the date of registration of the certificate of sale and
in the absence of any <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> within the <span style="">said pe­</span>riod, may the deed of final
sale be executed in favor of the purchaser who may then consolidate the title
of the property in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, We have to declare that the Land Registration Commissioner
was right in ordering the </span><span style="color: windowtext;">Register </span><span style="color: windowtext;">of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to deny the registration of the Deed of Sale and the
Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership, the simultaneous registration of which
documents was sought by herein petitioner </span><span style="color: windowtext;">even </span><span style="color: windowtext;">before the
certificate of sale issued by the sheriff was registered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
