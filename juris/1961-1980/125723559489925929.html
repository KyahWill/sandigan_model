				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for naturalization filed by Uy Chin Hua, a citizen of the 
Republic of China. The petition is supported by tke affidavits of Carlos P. 
Benares, a lawyer, and Vicente G. Ereñeta, a chemical engineer.
<p>Uy Chin Hua was born in Ebe, China on July 15, 1923 having come to the 
Philippines on December 18, 1928. He took up his primary, intermediate and 
secondary courses in the Iloilo City High School and studied engineering for one 
year in the Iloilo City College where Philippine history and civics are taught 
as part of its curriculum. He is married to Felisa Dy with whom he has four 
children two of whom are of school age and are studying at the Hua Ming Catholic 
School which is recognized by our Government and where civics, Philippine 
history and government are taught. He is employed as assistant manager in the 
Richoco Products the office of which is situated in Bacolod City owned and 
operated by his mother where he receives a monthly salary of P145.00. He has 
invested in said enterprise a capital of P7,320.00 and owns some shares of stock 
of the Acoje Oil and White Eagle Oversea Company worth P2,000.00. He speaks and 
writes English and the local dialect He believes in the principles underlying 
our Constitution and is not opposed to organized government nor affiliated with 
any group of persons who uphold the use of violence in the propagation of their 
social, political or religious ideas. He is not a polygamist, nor has he been 
convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude. He is not suffering from any 
contagious disease. He has conducted himself in a proper manner during the 
period of his residence in this country. He has religiously filed his annual 
income tax since 1948 and has helped in raising funds for charitable 
purposes.</p>
<p>On the strength of the above facts, the trial court granted the petition for 
naturalization. It ordered that after the lapse of two years from the 
promulgation of its order, and after proper hearing, pursuant to Republic Act 
No. 580, petitioner be allowed to take the oath of allegiance and be issued the 
corresponding certificate of naturalization.</p>
<p>The Government has appealed.</p>
<p>One of the qualifications required by law to become a citizen of the 
Philippines by naturalization is that petitioner must own real estate in the 
Philippines worth not less than P5,000.00 or he must have a known lucrative 
trade, profession, or lawful occupation. The Government contends that petitioner 
does not possess this qualification because he has not shown that he possesses a 
lucrative profession or a gainful occupation for the reason that he does not own 
any real estate in the Philippines and his only source of income is his 
employment in the Richoco Products Company where he receives a monthly salary of 
P145.00. The Government claims that such monthly income is insufficient to give 
petitioner an occupation that may be considered lucrative within the meaning of 
the law considering that he has four children and our cost of living is high 
while the purchasing capacity of our currency is low.</p>
<p>We agree with this contention; This is in line with the policy laid down by 
this Court in a series of recent decisions rendered in similar cases one of 
which is Te Eng Ling vs. Republic of thePhilippines, G. R. No. L-17918,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> wherein we said that one who earns an 
average monthly salary of P104.00, free laundry, board and lodging, even if he 
is single, cannot be considered as having a lucrative occupation considering the 
present high cost of living and the low purchasing capacity of our currency. In 
Velasco vs. Republic, we also held that petitioner's income of P150.00 a month 
considering the high cost of living and the low purchasing value of our peso is 
neither lucrative or substantial to meet the requirement of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Another pertinent case is Swee Din Tan vs. 
Republic, wherein we said: "We find a sounder reason to refuse citizenship: no 
lucrative employment. It is admitted that Swee Din Tan, with a wife and three 
children, is a mere employee receiving P200.00 a month only. We think that at 
the present valuation of the peso, petitioner may have an employment; but he has 
not a 'lucrative' employment." (109 Phil., 287).</p>
<p>.On the other hand, Vicente G. Ereñeta proved to be not qualified as a 
character witness for, according to him, he came to know petitioner during the 
Japanese occupation but has not had regular association with him except only in 
the later part of 1948 when they used to play basketball and there is nothing to 
show regarding their association from 1948 up to the date he testified in this 
case.</p>
<p>This faulty knowledge of Ereñeta as regards the conduct of petitioner can be 
gleaned from his testimony that the children of petitioner were enrolled in 
Philippine Schools when in fact they were enrolled in the Hua Ming School which 
is a Chinese school where Chinese children are predominant.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against 
petitioner.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br>
