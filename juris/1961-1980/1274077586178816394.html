				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for certiorari and prohibition, filed by the
Solicitor General on behalf of the Deportation Board and its members,
seeking to restrain enforcement of and nullify the writ of preliminary
injunction issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil
Case No. 51409 of said court, and to declare respondent Robert La Rue
Stewart not entitled to the relief prayed for therein. The facts of the
case, as may be gathered from the records, are as follows:
<p>On August 17, 1962, Robert La Rue Stewart, also known as Bob
Stewart, an American citizen resident of the Philippines was charged by
Special Prosecutors before the Deportation Board, of being an
undesirable alien (Dep. Case No. R-999). It was charged, among others,
that Stewart, in violation of the provisions of the Revised Election
Code, aided candidates running for office in the 1961 general elections
and/or otherwise tried to influence the said elections. Before the
hearing of the charges, Stewart (who was previously ordered arrested,
but was released on bail) orally moved for the dismissal of the
electioneering charge. Allegedly even before Stewart could state the
ground of his motion, the Chairman of the Deportation Board denied the
same. Thereupon, he filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of
thirst Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 51409) to restrain the
Deportation Board from proceeding with the hearing of the deportation
case insofar as it relates to the charges of electioneering, claiming
that under Section 185 of the Revised Election Code, jurisdiction to
entertain electioneering charge against a foreigner is vested in the
courts and the deportation of said alien is made an additional penalty
after the latter is found (by the court) to have committed a serious
violation of the election code. The respondent Board, therefore, it was
alleged, acted with grave abuse of authority and/or discretion, and
without authority, in proceeding with the hearing of the electioneering
charges against Stewart. Contending further that the continuation of
the proceedings will work injustice and irreparable injury to his
rights name, honor and reputation, petitioner prayed for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary injunction pending final termination of the
case.</p>
<p>The Deportation Board, respondent in the lower court, while not
questioning the jurisdiction of the said court to entertain the
prohibition case, nevertheless, opposed the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction, contending that petitioner Stewart was not
entitled to the principal relief prayed for in his petition,
predicating such contention on the allegation that the power of the
President to deport undesirable aliens being inherent to his position
as head of the executive branch of the government,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> could not be diminished or limited by the enactment by the legislature of Section 185 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
of the Revised Election Code. The Deportation Board, therefore, it was
claimed, possesses jurisdiction to entertain and pass upon the
electioneering charges filed in said Board against Stewart.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding respondent Board's opposition, the lower court, by
order of September 4, 1962, directed the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction with respect to the charge of electioneering
upon Stewart's filing a bond for P3,000.00. The motion for
reconsideration of the aforementioned order having been denied, the
Deportation Board filed the instant petition for the purpose already
stated at the beginning of this opinion.</p>
<p>The issue before us now is, therefore, limited to the question
whether the lower court gravely abused its discretion in issuing the
writ of preliminary injunction pending the determination by said court
of the disputed jurisdiction of the Deportation Board to conduct the
investigation of the electioneering charges against Stewart.</p>
<p>The reason given by the lower court for the issuance of such writ of
preliminary injunction is that the action being one for prohibition,
preliminary injunction is an indispensable provisional remedy to insure
that the relief asked for by the petitioner shall not be rendered
academic or ineffective. It is settled that where the principal case
was to restrain the commission or continuance of the act complained of,
the provisional remedy of preliminary injunction is proper to preserve
the<i> status quo</i> of things in order not to render ineffective any decision or relief  that may be subsequently rendered therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
This is not to say, that the mere filing of an action with prayer for
the restraint or discontinuance of certain acts automatically entitles
the plaintiff to the special remedy of preliminary injunction. Thus,
where an alien, claiming that he is actually a Filipino citizen, filed
an action for declaratory relief to determine his citizenship, his
prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the immigration
authorities from taking him into their custody was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Citizenship not being the proper subject for declaratory judgment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
it is clear that he is not entitled to the relief demanded in the main
case, and pursuant to Section 3 of Rule 60, preliminary injunction
shall not issue.</p>
<p>The same thing cannot be said, however, of the instant case. With
the filing of Civil Case No. 51409, Stewart presented for resolution of
the lower court the question of whether the investigation of a
foreigner for alleged violation of the Revised Election Code falls
exclusively within the jurisdiction of the courts, in view of the
provision of Section 185 of said code requiring prior judicial
conviction before deportation may attach as an additional penalty, or
whether, as claimed by herein petitioners, the Deportation Board, as
agent of the President, has also authority to conduct such
investigation and make the proper recommendation for action of the
Chief Executive. In a recent case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>, we said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Petitioners contend, however, that even granting
that the President is invested with power to deport, still he may do so
only upon the grounds enumerated in Commonwealth Act No. 613, as
amended, and on no other, as it would be unreasonable and undemocratic
to hold that an alien may be deported upon an unstated or undefined
ground depending merely on the unlimited discretion of the Chief
Executive. This contention is not without merit, considering that
whenever the legislature believes a certain act or conduct to be a just
cause for deportation, it invariably enacts a law to, that effect.
Thus, in a number of amendatory acts, grounds have been added to those
originally contained in Section 37 of Commonwealth Act No. 613, as
justifying deportation as part of the penalty imposed on aliens
committing violation thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view thereof, it cannot be definitely said, at this stage of the
proceeding, pending final determination of the issue on the authority
of the Deportation Board to investigate electioneering charges and
before trial on the merits, that respondent Stewart is indubitably not
entitled to the relief demanded in said case.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no grave abuse of discretion attending the
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction by the lower court in
Civil Case No. 51409, this petition is hereby dismissed and the writ
prayed for denied, without costs. So ordered.</p>
