<p class="BODY">In due time Armando <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> filed in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> a protest against
the election of Jose E. Garcia. Likewise, in due time <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>

be, alleged the commission of frauds, coercions and irregularities in specified
precincts in the municipa­lity of <span class="SpellE">Mallig</span>, and each

<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, crediting him with 678 votes, as against <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> Jose E. Garcia who <span style="">was </span>credited with 663 votes, or a

Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="12"><span style="">December
 10, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Special Second Division of </span>the Court of Appeals promulgated a decision
affirming the decision of the lower court which declared protestant Arman­do <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> the elected municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Mallig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals, however, declared that <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> had
won over Garcia by a margin of only five votes, instead of fifteen votes as
declared by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> Garcia filed
before this Court a petition for certiorari to review the decision of the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court <span style="">gave due </span>course to, the petition. </p>

<p class="BODY">Before this Court appellant Garcia assigns <span style="">five </span>errors
which, he alleges, had been committed by the Court of Ap­peals in deciding the
case against him. Likewise, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> assigns three errors which, he claims, had been com<span style="">mitted by the Court
of Appeals, and maintains that he should be declared winner </span><span style="">by-a </span><span style="">margin of more than five votes over appellant
Garcia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned by Garcia involve twenty (20) ballots, and
the errors assigned by <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> involve six (6) bal­lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these questioned ballots are properly
marked as exhibits and have been carefully examined by this Court. <span style="">The only question raised by both parties in
the appeal before this Court relates, to the appreciation of ballots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
shall first consider the ballots involved in the errors assigned by appellant
Garcia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. <u>Exhibits 40, 53 and 67.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court, as well as the Court of Appeals, ruled that these
ballots are valid ballots for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Garcia contends that the Court of Appeals
erred in declaring these three ballots valid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Garcia im­pugns these ballots <span style="">as </span>marked.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed that ballot Exhibit 40 is a marked bal­lot -- the
alleged mark being the word "<span class="SpellE">Siababa</span>"
written on lines 7 and 8 for senators; that ballot Exhibit 53 is also a marked
ballot -- the alleged mark being the word "<span class="SpellE">Cibaba</span>"
written on line 8 for councilors; and that ballot Exhibit 67 is likewise a
marked ballot -- the alleged mark being the word "<span class="SpellE">Sarangaya</span>"
written on the first line for senator, no candidate for senator having been
voted on the seven other lines for senator.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that there was a candidate for mayor whose surname
is "<span class="SpellE">Siababa</span>", and that there was a
candidate for member of the provincial board whose surname is "<span class="SpellE">Saran­gaya</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">Garcia maintains that these three ballots should be declared
invalid because, in the memorandum filed by the counsel for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
in the trial court, the counsel admitted that these three ballots are
marked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that counsel for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> really stated in his memorandum that these three
ballots are marked, but the admission of counsel for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
that these three ballots are marked was done in order that he would be
consistent with his objections to the ballots of Garcia which were found to be
marked in a manner more or less similar to the three ballots in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These three ballots are impugned as marked because
it appears on each of these ballots that the name of a candidate is written on
the line corresponding to the office for which he was not a candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in ballot Exhibit 40 the word "<span class="SpellE">Sia­baba</span>", which is the surname of a candidate for
mayor is written on lines 7 and 8 for senator; in ballot Exhibit 53 the word <span style="">'<span class="SpellE">Cibaba</span>’ </span>(<u>idem</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>sonans</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Siababa</span>)
is written on line 8 for councilor; and in ballot Exhibit 67 the word "<span class="SpellE">Sarangaya</span>", which is the surname of a candidate for
member of the provincial board, is written on the first line for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that there are ballots where Garcia
is voted for mayor and are objected to by <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> also
on the ground that a candidate's name, or the name of a person, is <span style="">written on the line
corresponding to an office for which he was not </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">candidate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court disregarded the admission of <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
<span style="">1 </span>that these three ballots
(Exhibits 40, 53 and 67) are mark­ed and declared them valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court likewise dec­lared valid
those ballots of Garcia where alleged marks similar to those claimed to be
found on the three ballots in question also appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in declaring valid these three ballots
of <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> (Exhibits 40, 53 and 67), the trial court
made reference <span style="">to its ruling which </span>declared
valid <span style="">the ballots of Garcia (Exhibits
AA, BB, KKK, XXXX, UUU, VVV, and WWW), which were objected to on practically
the same grounds as the objections to these three ballots in ques­tion.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is Our view that the trial court had acted correct­ly when it
disregarded the admission of counsel for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> that
these three ballots in question are marked ballots and ruled on them on the
basis of what appear on the faces of' those ballots, in the same manner that it
had ruled on other ballots that were similarly objected to; and the Court of
Appeals did not commit any error when it likewise disregard­ed the contention
of Garcia that these three ballots should be declared invalid because counsel
for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> had admitted that these ballots are
marked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the observa<span style="">tions of the Court of Appeals regarding these
three ballots, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

senator and, councilor, respectively, in Exhibits 40 and 53, <span style="">while <span class="SpellE">Sarangaya</span>, a </span>candi­date

considering </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">merely stray the votes therein for <span class="SpellE">Sarangaya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Siababa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court is not bound by protestant's

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is a </span>settled
doctrine that an election protest involves public interest.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
So in an election protest the determination of whether <span style="">a </span>ballot is valid or invalid <span style="">should be left exclusively to the court or
electoral tribunal taking cognizance of the election case, either during the
trial or on appeal, as the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To sanction the idea that the court or electoral tribunal </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">duty bound to
accept the admission of a party in an election case regarding the validity or
invalidity of a ballot or ballots, involved in the case, would be to leave to
the parties, or to their counsel, the determination of the result of the
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice would open the
door to collusions or compromises which could affect the decision of the
election case -- and the decision may not reflect the true expression of the
will of the electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Matters
involving the public interest should not be the subject of compromises, or
decided on the basis of admis­sions or concessions by private parties whose
interests are only secondary to those of the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law provides that upon the petition of
any interested party, or <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> if the interest of justice so requires, the
court </span><span style="">should
order the production before it of the ballot boxes and all </span><span style="">election </span><span style="">documents relevant

<p class="BODY">The three ballots in question, therefore, should be appreciated,
or ruled upon, on the basis of what appear on the face of these ballots
regardless of the admission of the counsel for <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
-- that admission, as We have adverted to, having been made only so he would be
<span style="">consis­</span>tent with his objections
to the ballots of Garcia which appear to bear marks or defects similar to the
ones appear­ing on these three ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon examination by this Court of these three ballots, Exhibits
40, 53 and 67, <span style="">We </span>find that
ballot Exhibit 40 should be declared invalid for being marked. We find that the
word "<span class="SpellE">Siababa</span>" is written twice on this
ballot (lines 7 and 8 for senator) in such a <span style="">manner </span><span style="">as </span>to
indicate the <span class="SpellE">the</span> intention of the voter to identify
his ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The words "<span class="SpellE">Siababa</span>"
are so written twice toward the right side of the ballot such that they are
more or less isolated as to catch the eye and serve as a distinguish­ing mark

We also declare this ballot Exhibit FF as marked and, therefore, invalid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In ballot Exhibit II the words "never mind my dear" are
written on line 6 for councilor, and the words "the other" are
written on line 7, such that all the words read "Never mind my dear the

the words <span style="">as </span>irrelevant and
constitute <span style="">a </span>mark on the bal­lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority of this Court is of the view
that these words simply indicate the desistance of the voter from voting for
the other candidates for councilor, after writing names on the first three

<p class="BODY">Exhibit RRRR <span style="">was </span>declared invalid by the courts below for being marked. The
mark on this ballot consists in the writing of the letter 0 on line 7 for
senators, letters K, Q, S (or 8), L, G, M and K, and H <span class="SpellE">Myo</span>
res­pectively on lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for coun­cilors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court agrees with the trial court and
the Court of Appeals that this <span style="">is </span>a marked ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very apparent that the voter wrote
those letters on those lines for no other purpose than to make his ballot
easily dis­tinguishable from other ballots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The voter wrote the names of candidates for senator from lines 1 to 6
for senators, and also the names of the persons whom he voted for mayor and
vice-mayor on their respective lines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <span style="">circumstance
indicates that the voter could write com­plete names if he chose to, and when
he simply wrote one Capital letter on each of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">other lines he could have no other purpose
but that of placing a distinguish­ing mark on his ballot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In ballot Exhibit TTTT the word "yes" is written three
times successively on lines 1, 2 and 3 for members of the Provincial

the view that the words "yes" were mistakenly written by the voter on
the lines for members of the provincial board as answers to the questions in
connection with the plebiscite regarding the amendments to the Constitution,
and do not constitute marks on this ballot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We declare this ballot valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">In ballot Exhibit DDDDD the Words "<span class="SpellE">Mabohay</span>
Garcia" are written below the last line for councilor and on the heavy
horizontal line indicating the lower edge of the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this ballot the name Garcia is already
voted for mayor and that all the spaces for councilor had been filled with the
names of persons voted for councilor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is very apparent that these irrelevant words "<span class="SpellE">Mabohay</span>
Garcia", written as they are at the bottom part of the ballot, were
intended to mark this ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree
with the trial court and the Court of Appeals that this ballot <span style="">is </span>marked

<p class="BODY">In ballot Exhibit GGGG the word "<span class="SpellE">Bayauac</span>"

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Isabela</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
the word "<span class="SpellE">Bayauac</span>" refers to a big lizard.
On this ballot the voter had properly voted for seven candidates for senator.
The word "<span class="SpellE">Bayauac</span>" is definitely irrelevant
and it serves <span style="">as
a </span>distinguishing mark of the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The voter who prepared this ballot <span style="">is </span>intelligent and writes well, and he even

(Com­missioner's Report, pp. 21-22.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The minutes of voting as summarized in the report con­tained nothing

<p class="BODY">The two ballots (Exhs. DD and 1) with the word "Joe"
written on the line for mayor would be decisive in favor of petitioner if
"Joe" could be considered as the Christian <span style="">name </span><span style="">of petitioner Jose E. Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such <span style="">case, these ballots could be
validly appreciated in petitioner's favor under section 149, rule 1 of the
Revised Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since the
Court </span>of Appeals has found as a fact that "Joe" is merely his
nick­name and petitioner himself admitted this to be so, I concur with the
application of <span style="">Rule 9 </span>of section
149 <span style="">that a nickname standing alone
cannot be counted in favor of a candidate.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
