				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from the order of dismissal of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, in its Civil Case No. 3197. <br>
<br>
The plaintiff-appellant, Esperidion Tolentino, prays, in the complaint
that he filed with the lower court on 20 May 1959, for the enforcement
of the dissenting opinion rendered in the case entitled "Severo
Domingo, et al.<i> vs.</i> Santos, Ongsiako, et al.," G. R. No. 32776. <br>
<br>
The decision in said case (in favor of appellees' predecessors, and
adverse to those of appellant) was promulgated by,this Court on 4
December 1930, and together with the dissenting opinion, appears in
Volume 55 of the Philippine Reports, starting on page 361.
Unfortunately, the records of said case were lost, or destroyed, during
the war. <br>
<br>
The plaintiff-appellant claims to be the successor-in-interest of the
late Severo Domingo, who died without having received a copy of the
decision, and alleges that plaintiff-appellant learned of the decision
only about a week before, he filed the aforementioned complaint; that
the decision of the majority of the Court was erroneous and unjust;
that the dissenting opinion is the correct view of the case, and should
be enforced. The court below, on motion of one of the several
defendants, dismissed the case, for lack of cause of action. <br>
<br>
Not satisfied, the plaintiff-appellant interposed the present appeal,
and urges that the failure of service of a copy of the decision upon
the late Severo Domingo was a denial of due process, which invalidates
the decision, and asks that, on equitable grounds, the present case be
heard as a proceeding<i> coram nobis.</i> <br>
<br>
Assuming the truth of the allegation that Severo Domingo, appellant's
predecessor-in-interest, was never furnished a copy of the decision in
G.R. No. 32776, it appears in the printed report of the case (55 Phil.
361) that he was represented by Atty. Ramon Diokno. Being represented
by counsel, service of the decision is made upon the latter by the
clerk of the Supreme Court (Sec. 250, Act 190), and not upon the client
(Palad <i>vs.</i>
Cui, 28 Phil. 44); and the unrebutted presumption is that the said
official of this Court had regularly performed his duty (No. 14, Sec.
334, Act 190; Sec. 69(m), Rule 123, Rules of Court). Appellant's
alleged predecessor-in-interest was not, therefore, denied due process
of law . <br>
<br>
Appellant's position that the decision was erroneous and unjust is
entirely untenable, because the issue sought to be reopened is <i>res judicata,</i>
aside from its having stood unchallenged for 30 years. The ridiculous
prayer to enforce a dissenting opinion requires no discussion, it being
sufficient to state that there is nothing to enforce in a dissenting
opinion, since it affirms or overrules no claim, right, or obligation,
and neither disposes of, nor awards, anything; it merely expresses the
views, of the dissanter. <br>
<br>
Lastly, the appellant's claim that "the lower court erred in not allowing plaintiffs-appellants' cause as a proceeding <i>coram nobis",</i> is devoid of merit. The ancient common law writ of error <i>coram nobis,</i>
now substantially obsolete even in common law jurisdictions (49 CJS p.
561), does not lie after affirmance of a judgment on writ of error or
appeal (94 CJS p. 562); nor can it be grounded on facts already in
issue and adjudicated on the trial (49 CJS 567). Moreover, the
jurisdiction of a writ of eror <i>coram nobis </i>lies exclusively in
the court which rendered the judgment sought to be corrected (49 CJS
568), so that it should have been sought by appellants, if at all, in
the Supreme Court, and not in the Court of First Instance. <br>
<br>
In the Philippines, no court appears to have even recognized such writ,
the rule in this jurisdiction being that public policy and sound
practice demand that, <i>at the risk of occasional errors,</i> judgments of courts should become final and irrevocable at some definite date fixed by law. <span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span><i>Interest rei publicae ut finis sit litium. </i><br>
