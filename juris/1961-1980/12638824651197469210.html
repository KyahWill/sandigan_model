				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Considerable stress is laid by petitioner in this motion for the
reconsideration of our decision of May 31, 1977 dismissing the <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding to set aside a resolution of respondent Secretary of Labor granting
clearance to private respondent, the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
University Foundation, for his dismissal as professor in such University, but
without payment to him of P14<span class="GramE">,480.00</span> as accrued back
wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will be shown<span class="GramE">,</span> there is lack of support in law for such a
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there is sympathy for
the plight in which petitioner now finds <span class="GramE">himself</span>,
still the norm followed by this Court in suits for <i>certiorari</i> directed
against the Secretary of Labor does not call for an <span style="">affirmative response.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
his own motion for reconsideration categorically stated that he would not
"like anymore to teach in the [<span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
University Foundation] and so [he is] not asking for reinstatement."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In</span>
the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, what was complained of was lack of
procedural due process not in the proceeding before the labor officials but
before the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> Foundation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a charge was reiterated in the memorandum filed on his behalf by his then
counsel, the principal point raised being that the members of the panel of
investigators were all prejudiced against him and that it was not
"therefore amazing that the poor petitioner in the instant case does not
have a chance."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It was admitted though that a previous investigation that took place on <st1:date month="4" day="24" year="1974">April 24, 1974</st1:date> "was attended by
petitioner as well as complainant with his two witnesses."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In the decision sought to be reconsidered, mention was made of such a
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After which, there was reference
to a denial of a motion for postponement filed by petitioner in the second
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a deficiency, as was
explained in our decision, was remedied in view of the fact that petitioner had
the chance to air his side before the Labor Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
well-settled that an infirmity that would vitiate the original proceeding could
thereafter, either on a motion for reconsideration or on review by another
body, be subject to correction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In this motion for reconsideration,
petitioner had shifted ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The major thrust now is that the hearing before the National
Labor Relations Commission did not conform with the requirements of procedural
due process as the witnesses against petitioner were not called before it so
that they could be cross-examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
pointed out in the comment of Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
P. Mendoza:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This argument is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well-established
principle that the right of an accused or a party to be confronted by the
witnesses against him is a personal privilege which the latter may avail
himself of or which he may waive, as he may see fit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waiver may take the form of an express
consent, by failure to assert it on time, or by conduct inconsistent with a
purpose to insist on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, petitioner's lack of objection in the formal hearings before the labor
Arbiter to the presentation of the testimonies of his complainants and their
witnesses taken during the school investigations and his lack of assertion of
his right to cross-examine them on their affidavits submitted thereat, coupled
with the fact that he presented his evidence, together with his affidavit,
impugning the regularity of the proceedings before the investigating committees
and assailing the legality of his removal, are clear indications that
petitioner had waived his right to confront his complainants and elected to
rely solely on the strength of his own evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot now complain that he was denied
such a right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant to note
in this regard that petitioner never impugned the regularity of the proceedings
before the Labor Arbiter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, he admitted that 'indeed, the NLRC Hearing Officer, the Labor
Arbiter, strictly followed the due-process requirements.' <span class="GramE">(Motion
for Reconsideration, p. 10)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner would seem
to mitigate the force of such admission about the observance of procedural due
process by asserting that it was incumbent on the respondent University to
present the witnesses in the National Labor Relations Commission hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a misapprehension on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All he is guaranteed under the authoritative <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> doctrine is that he be
heard.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Implicit in such a concept is that the burden is cast on him to sustain his
side of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he fails to
do so, the adminisÂ­trative agency concerned could rely on the evidence offered
by the other party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was what
happened in this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
If at all then, petitioner had only himself to blame.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is petitioner's
case for reconsideration bolstered by the reference to the high ideal that
animates the concept of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As was pointed out in J. M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> and
Co. v.</span> The Land Tenure Administration:<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
"It is a mandate of reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
frowns on <span class="GramE">arbitrariness,</span> it is the antithesis of any
government act that smacks of whim or caprice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It negates state power to act in an oppressive manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, as had been stressed so often, the embodiment
of the sporting idea of fair play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that sense, it stands as a guaranty of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the standard that must be met by any governmental agency in the
exercise of whatever competence is entrusted to it."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If the various proceedings had in this case, including the first
investigation, were considered in their totality, it cannot be said that the
decision arrived at by respondent Secretary of Labor is susceptible to the
charge of arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worth
noting anew that there was a previous investigation where petitioner had the
chance to cross-examine the witnesses against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the finding was adverse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was true his services were not terminated,
a lighter penalty being imposed on him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Viewed in such a light, the imputation that respondent Secretary of
Labor, which is the only issue before us, acted in disregard of the due process
mandate is not borne out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
justification for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of the
injury to his reputation arising from the dismissal of his petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
it should be made clear that the only issue before this Court in this
proceeding is whether or not the actuation of an administrative official in the
enforcement of the Labor Code could be stigmatized as a denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion reached by this Court after a
review of the records is that it could not be so considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was all that was decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision reached by respondent public
official to grant clearance to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
University Foundation was thus upheld.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the import of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In contemplation of law, it is not strictly accurate to state that there
was a finding on the part of this Court that immorality was proven against the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is signified by the
decision sought to be reconsidered is that the procedure followed resulting in
this clearance for his dismissal cannot be characterized as tainted by a denial
of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the
issue before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was what was
passed upon and decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His dismissal
from the service then could be viewed in a light less damaging to his prestige
and reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering his ability
and talent as revealed by his pleadings, whatever injurious effect the decision
may have had could be mitigated by the lapse of time.</p>
