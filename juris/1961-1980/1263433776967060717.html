"The People of the Philippines versus <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
Barrios and Rico <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>" finding the two
accused guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing each one of
them to death and to jointly and severally pay the heirs of the victim <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Castillo y Molina the sum of P12,000.00 for the
death of said victim and the sums of P10,000.00 as moral damages, P10,000.00 as

<p class="BODY">The two accused, <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Barrios y <span class="SpellE">Almoguera</span> and Rico <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> y <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> were charged in September 1971 with the crime of
robbery with homicide in the following:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"INFORMATION</p>

<blockquote>The undersigned accuses <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Barrios y <span class="SpellE">Almoguera</span> and Rico <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> y <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> of the crime of robbery with homicide, committed as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That on or about August 28, 1971, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating with one other
whose identity and whereabouts are still unknown and helping one another, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously,
by means of force and violence, and with intent to gain, take away from <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Castillo y Molina, a taxi driver, the latter's
earnings of undetermined amount, to the damage and prejudice of the said <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Castillo y Molina in the said undetermined amount;
that on the occasion of the said robbery and for the purpose of enabling them
to take, steal and carry away the aforesaid earning of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Castillo y Molina, the herein accused, in pursuance of their conspiracy, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously,
with intent to kill, attack, assault and use personal violence upon the said <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Castillo y Molina, by then and there stabbing him
with a bladed instrument, thereby inflicting upon him physical injuries which
were the direct cause of his death thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(SGD.)
RODOLFO C. CASAS</blockquote>

<blockquote>Assistant Fiscal</blockquote>

<blockquote>I hereby certify that an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
investigation in this case has been conducted by me in accordance with law;
that there is reasonable ground to believe that the offense charged has been
committed; and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:date year="1971" day="13" month="9">Sept. 13, 1971</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the trial court, are:</p>

<blockquote>"A careful study of the evidence presented, shows the fact
that victim <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Castillo y Molina, a taxi driver,
was killed and robbed of his earnings has never been disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only issue in this case, therefore, is
the criminal participation of the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The corroborating statements of both accused (Exhibit 'F', statement
of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> and Exhibit 'G', statement of Barrios)
indubitably show that said accused, together with one Arthur, who is still at
large, conspired, confederated with and helped one another in killing and
robbing the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
admitted in his statement (Exhibit 'F') that he invited Barrios to stage a
hold-up in <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, a taxi passed by and he stopped
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They boarded the same and he sat in
the front seat while Barrios and Arthur sat at the back with Arthur immediately
behind the driver of the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Barrios poked the <span class="SpellE">balisong</span> on the
taxi driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they pulled said taxi
driver to the rear seat in order to frisk him but the driver shouted for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fearing that they might be heard and the driver
would create a scandal, Barrios immediately stabbed the driver 3 times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he and his companions fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> further declared
that Barrios also stabbed the taxi driver because he fought back.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Barrios likewise admitted in his statement (Exhibit 'G') that they
actually stopped the taxi at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
and Estrada Streets and got the money of the driver but the driver fought back
and for which reason he stabbed him with a kitchen knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, he and his two companions
fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot remember the number of
times he stabbed the taxi driver because he was then drunk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that both accused confessed to the truth is strongly shown
by the corroborating testimony of <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr., who testified in a spontaneous, categorical,
logical and straightforward manner with marked fluency and ease that between
2:00 and 2:30 a.m. of August 28, 1971, while he was still half-awake, he heard
a commotion consisting of a sound of a car, a radio and the struggle of some
men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even heard a shout '<span class="SpellE">iwanan</span> mo <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">yan</span>'
and the slamming of the door of the taxi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He looked out of the window and saw a taxi at standstill, around 9 to 10
meters away, but with the engine on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inside the taxi, he saw two men at the rear seat struggling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the driver (he said he is the driver
because he was the one who shouted '<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>') came
out and started running towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> shouting '<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The man who was inside, at the rear of the taxi, also went out and ran
on the opposite direction towards Estrada.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr.
that he saw two men struggling in the rear seat of the taxi, one of whom he
believes to be the taxi driver because he was the one shouting '<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>', corroborates the admission of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> that they pulled the taxi driver from the front to
the rear seat in order to frisk him of his money (Exhibit 'F', answer to
question No. 6); the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr. that
the taxi driver went out of his taxi and shouted corroborates also a portion of
the answer of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> to question No. 6 (Exhibit 'F')
that the taxi driver got out of his taxi and shouted; and the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr. that he saw two men struggling at the back of
the taxi also corroborates the statements of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
and Barrios that Barrios stabbed the taxi driver because the latter fought
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The credibility of <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr. cannot be doubted for in the absence of
evidence showing improper motive actuating the principal prosecution witnesses
tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive existed and their
testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit (People versus <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>, L-31238, February 27, 1971)."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The two accused maintained that they were maltreated into giving
their statements admitting their participation in the commission of the crime
charged in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statements in question were subscribed and sworn to before
Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the two accused
refused or even hesitated to sign and swear to said statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not complain to the fiscal that they
were maltreated by the police officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, the statements are considered to have been
voluntarily given.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The assertion of the accused Rico <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
that he did not complain to the fiscal before whom he subscribed and swore to
the statement because he was afraid of the police officers is not
credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the gravity of the
offense, it is logical to assume that the fiscal examined thoroughly the two
accused on the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of their
statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the two accused were
really maltreated they should have complained because the probable penalty of
death for the crime charged is more awesome than the feared reprisal of the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is no evidence
of the alleged maltreatment other than the bare assertion of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statements of the two accused contain details most of which
could only have been furnished by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The allegation of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> that they drank
first beer or liquor on the railroad track in <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
Street; that he was the one who sat in front of the taxicab while the other
accused sat on the rear seat; that Barrios was the one who poked a knife at the
taxi driver; that the driver was pulled to the rear seat of the taxicab so that
he could be frisked of his money; that the driver shouted "<span class="SpellE">saklolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>"; and that the
driver was stabbed because he fought back are details that could not have been
concocted by the police investigators.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Barrios, narrated
in his statement that the driver fought back when the former took his money;
that said accused stabbed the driver with a kitchen knife; that before the
robbery, he and the other accused first drank liquor by the bridge going to the
railroad track that he knows Col. <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span> who lives at
the corner of Estrada and <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> Streets; that it is
true that he went to Col. <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span> three (3) days after
the incident and asked what said accused should do as he is one of those being
suspected in the killing and robbing of the driver as reported in a newspaper;
and that he read in the Daily Star that he is a suspect and Col. <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span> is a witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These details could not have been known to the police investigators.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled rule that where the statement of the accused
mentions details which only the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> could have
furnished and could not have been concocted by the investigator, the confession
is considered to have been voluntarily given.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the
presumption is that the police officers who investigated the accused performed
their official duties regularly.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense interposed by the accused that on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1971</st1:date> they were narrating
stories in the house at <st1:street><st1:address>2473 <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, the residence of <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
Barrios, is not credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is a
defense that can very easily be concocted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, alibi to be sustained as a defense must be supported by
strong evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the
accused in support of their alibi is weak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is strange that the accused and their companions should be conversing
up to <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is contrary to the
ordinary course of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
Virginia <span class="SpellE">Siscon</span>, a witness of the accused, declared
that she conversed with the accused and other persons only up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place where the accused and other persons
allegedly told stories was at <st1:street><st1:address>2473 <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> which was near the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime was committed on the same
street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was every possibility for
the two accused to have been present at the scene of the crime although earlier
that evening they were conversing with other people in the house at <st1:street><st1:address>2473
  <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that for alibi to prosper, the evidence must
show that the accused was so far away that he could not have been physically
present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its
commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution has established beyond reasonable
doubt that the two accused committed the crime charged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court imposed the death penalty on both accused because
of the finding that the commission of the crime was attended by the aggravating
circumstances of craft and abuse of superior strength without any mitigating
circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the
prosecution has not established the aggravating circumstances of craft and
abuse of superior strength.</p>

<p class="BODY">Craft is a circumstance characterized by trickery or cunning
resorted to by the accused to carry out his design.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that craft was present because the two
accused stopped the taxicab by pretending to be passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence that the two accused pretended
to be passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is not
clear how the taxicab was stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only eyewitness for the prosecu­tion, <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr., declared that between 2:00 and 2:30 o'clock in
the morning of August 28, 1971, he was half-awake when there occurred a
commotion outside his house consisting of a sound of a car, radio and the
struggling of some men; that upon looking out of the window, he saw a taxicab
at a standstill about 9 or 10 feet away from the window; that he was in the
second floor of the house; that the engine of the car was running; that before
looking outside, the witness heard a man shouting "<span class="SpellE">Iwanan</span>
mo <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">yan</span>."; that when
he heard the slamming of the door of the taxicab and he peeped out immediately,
he saw the taxicab already parked outside; that he saw two men struggling
inside the taxicab at the rear seat; that the taxi driver came out and ran
towards <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> Street shouting "<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>.";
that a few seconds after the taxi driver had run out, the man inside the
taxicab at the rear also ran towards the opposite direction going to Estrada
Street; and that the two persons struggling at the rear of the taxicab were the
taxi driver and a man.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing testimony that when <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Quimpo</span>, Jr. looked
out of the window from his house, the taxicab was already at a standstill and
that only two men were struggling at the rear seat of the taxicab, the driver
of the taxicab and one man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
testimony of the prosecution witness also rules out the existence of the
aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only one man was struggling with the taxi
driver at the rear seat of the taxicab and the witness saw only one man coming out
of the rear of the taxicab and running towards the opposite direction going to <st1:street><st1:address>Estrada
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that an aggravating circumstance should be proven
as fully as the crime itself in order to aggravate the penalty.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the trial court erred in imposing the
penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime was
committed without the presence of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision under automatic review is hereby
affirmed, with the sole modification that the penalty imposed on the two
accused is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, with
costs against said accused.</p>
