				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Although entitled "Petition for <em>Certiorari</em>" and the prayer thereof suggests that it is an original action for <em>certiorari</em>, this proceeding is, in effect, an appeal by <em>certiorari</em>
from a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission sentencing
herein petitioner, Pampanga Sugar Development Co., Inc., hereinafter
referred to as the Company, to pay P1,899.24 to Donato Quiroz, plus
P142.44 to his counsel and P24.00 to the Workmen's Compensation Fund.
<p>The facts are set forth in said decision, from which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is practically no controversy as to the circumstances surrounding the accident that befell the claimant. The claimant<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> who was employed as centrifugal operator by the respondent<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>
reported for work on March 7, 1958 at around 9:30 p.m. and was
dismissed at around 5:30 a.m. the following day. Soon after he stepped
out of the company gate, and while standing about 2-1/2 meters from it
between the shoulder of the highway and a railroad that came from
inside the compound and intersected the highway, waiting for a ride
home, he was bumped by a jeepney as a result of which he sustained
various wounds on his body as well as a complete fracture of his left
clavicle. According to the records of the case, the injured was with
other employees of the same company waiting for transportation. There
is nothing in the records which shows that respondent had taken
measures to make the waiting place safe for the employees."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main issue for determination in this case is whether the
injuries sustained by claimant Quiroz, under the circumstances
indicated, were produced by an accident "arising out of and in the
course of employment", as this clause is used in Section 2 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>
<p>As stated in In re McNicol (102 NE [1913] 697):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * It is sufficient to say that an injury is
received 'in the course of employment when it comes while the workman
is doing the duty which he is employed to perform. It arises 'out of'
the employment when there is apparent in the rational mind * * * causal
connection between the conditions under which the work is required to
be performed and the resulting injury * * *. But <em>it excludes</em> an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing <em>proximate</em> cause and which comes from a hazard to <em>which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment</em>. The causative danger must be <em>peculiar</em> to the work, and <em>not common to the neighborhood</em>. It must <em>be incidental to the character of the business</em>, and <em>not independent of the relation of master and servant</em>. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event, <em>it must appear to have had its origin on a risk connected with the employment</em>, to have <em>flowed from that source as a rational consequence</em>.</p>
  <p>"An
injury or accident 'befalls a man in the course of his employment, if
it occurs while he is doing what a man may reasonably do within a time
during which he is employed, and at a place where he may reasonably be
during that time. 13 NACCA LAW JOURNAL 28-29. And it 'arises out of the
work of the employer, when it results from a risk or hazard which is <em>necessarily</em> or ordinarily or reasonably <em>inherent</em> in or incident to the conduct of such work or business." (Italics ours.)</p>
  <p>As
a consequence, the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that
injuries sustained by an employee, outside the premises of the
employer, while going to or returning from work, are <em>not</em> compensable. Referring to the exceptions, Larson has this to say:</p>
  <p>"* * * recoveries have been allowed off the employment premises, outside
business hours, when an employee going to or coming from work is
injured by a hazard <em>distinctly traceable</em> to the employment, such as a traffic jam <em>overflowing from the employment premises</em>, or a rock flying through the air from a <em>blast on the premises</em>.
Here, by normal course of employment standards, there would be no
award, since the employee was not on the premises while coming or
going. Yet the <em>unmistakable</em> character of the causal relation
of the injury to the employment has been sufficient to make up for the
weakness of the 'course' factor. Another example of the same kind of
balancing-out is seen in the line of cases dealing with injury to
travelling men or loggers while sleeping in hotels or bunkhouses. It
was shown in the analysis of these cases that, although the 'course'
factor is on the borderline when the employee is sound asleep at the
time of injury, a <em>strong causal relation</em> of the injury to the
conditions of employment—as where a fellow-logger runs amok, or a straw
falls into a bunkhouse-inmate's throat from the mattress above, or the
employee is trapped in a burning hotel—will boost the case over the
line to success; while a <em>weak</em> causal relation, as where the
salesman merely slips in the hotel bath, coupled with the weak 'course1
factor due to the absence of any direct service performed for the
employer at the time, will under present decisions add up to a quantum
of work-connection <em>too small</em> to support an award."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span> (Italics ours.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the compensability of an injury suffered by an employee
proceeding to or coming from his work depends upon whether or not it is
"work connected". As Chief Justice Kenison of New Hampshire has put it,
"the fact that the employee is travelling to or from work on a public
highway does not necessarily exclude coverage (Brousseau <em>vs</em>.
Blackstone Mills, 130 A 2d 543, 545). Conversely, it is not enough to
say that the employee would not have been on the public highway had it
not been for his job, since the same can usually be said of the general
public (Payne &amp; Dolan <em>vs</em>. Industrial Commission, 46 NE 2d 925). The law, in effect, insures the employee against losses arising <em>from the perils of his work</em>.
In other words, the Workmen's Compensation Act covers occupational
injuries, which, as such, must have a causative connection with
something, not merely in common with the public, but peculiar to the
employment. In order to warrant recovery for off-the-premises injuries,
it must be shown that there has been a very special danger, some
particular risk which the employer could have caused or allowed to
exist.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> Hence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is significant that practically <em>all</em> successful off-the-premises cases have involved either a dangerous railroad crossing <em>lying in the normal route of access to the plant</em>, or an icy sidewalk adjacent to the premises and therefore <em>identified with the premises in the sense that the employer should have removed the ice</em>. In other words, there has always been a <em>very special</em> danger."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> (Italics ours.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that in Philippine Fiber Processing Co. <em>vs</em>. Ampil, G.R. No. L-7130 (June 30, 1956), we held the employer liable for an injury sustained by an employee who, as he was <em>running to his place of work to avoid the rain</em>, slipped and <em>fell into a ditch in front of the factory's</em> main gate and near the same. <em>The ditch was, however, in itself an obvious hazard</em>
which, owing to its proximity to the gate, the employer should have
taken measures to remove. Thus, thru his inaction, he had contributed, <em>in a special way</em>, to the occurrence of the accident.</p>

<p>In the case at bar, no such special circumstances appears to exist. There is no <em>particular</em>
causative connection between the injury sustained by the employee and
either his work or his employer. Although, as stated in the decision
appealed from, the record does not show that the company "had taken
measures to make the waiting place safe for the employees", neither
does the record show either that the accident occurred at the usual
waiting place of the employees, or that said place was <em>particularly</em> unsafe.<strong></strong><br></p><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby
reversed, and petitioner herein absolved from the claim of Donato
Quiroz, without special pronouncement as to costs. It is so ordered.</p>
