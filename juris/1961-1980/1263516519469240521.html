us for review of the sentence of death passed upon the accused by the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Late in the night of <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1957</st1:date>, <span style="">in the <u>Barrio</u>
</span>of <span class="SpellE">Malinao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atimonan</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style="">, a </span>group of seven young <span style="">men serenaded the house, where <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Erotes</span>
lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Invited to come up, the young men accepted the invitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span>
Hernandez was seated beside </span><span class="SpellE">Estel<span style="">ita</span></span><span style="">, an uninvited Philippine Army Sergeant, <span class="SpellE">Getulio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, in T-Shirt, came up and asked Hernandez to
allow him to sit beside <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>, but Hernandez
refused the request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The time was
<span style="">about </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="1"><span style="">1:30 A.M.</span></st1:time><span style="">, June 29.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> said nothing and showed no sign of
anger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he immediately </span>left
<span style="">and went to his camp about half a
kilometer distant, put on his </span>fatigue uniform, <span style="">got a rifle, went back to the house and stationed him</span>self on the
stairway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2:00 A.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">At </span>this time, the <span class="SpellE">serenaders</span> left the house to go to and <span style="">serenade another house in the Northern part
of the </span><u>Bar</u><u><span style="">rio</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> followed the group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the <span class="SpellE">serenaders</span> had walked a distance of
about thirty meters with <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> </span>following
them at a distance of about <span style="">five
meters, <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> suddenly shouted "<span class="SpellE">Ano</span> <span class="SpellE">yan</span>? <span class="SpellE">Ano</span>
<span class="SpellE">yan</span>?<span class="GramE">".</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Turning their heads back they saw <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span> raise the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">garand</span></span>
rifle and aim at </span>them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before any
of them could run away, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pantoja</span></span><span style=""> fired two
shots in rapid succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
shot hit Angel <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> who instantly fell on his
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second shot hit <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez who fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other <span class="SpellE">serenaders</span>
scampered away for safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, who had </span>walked nearer, then fired one <span style="">more shot at the prostrate body of <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> </span>and four more <span style="">shots at the prostrate </span>body of <span style="">Hernandez.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, testifying in his own defense, admitted that the
shots he fired from the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">garand</span></span>
rifle killed <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> and Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The autopsy report attributed the deaths to
internal hemorrhage and the destruction of vital organs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court found the <span style="">defendant
guilty </span>of double <span class="GramE"><span style="">murder,
that</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">complex crime, and sentenced him to </span>the penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">We immediately noted that the lower court erred in finding the
appellant guilty of a complex crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appel­lant's brief, however, does not contain an assignment of this
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, we can
consider the error, the case under review being a criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is well known to
students of criminal law, as early as thirty-five years ago, that according to
Article </span><span style="">48, </span><span style="">as amended, of the Revised Penal Code, there
are two classes of complex crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first class comprises cases where a single act constitutes two or more
crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second class covers cases
where one crime </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">necessary means for
committing the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar
does not fall under the first class because in this case there were two acts,
two shots, one killing <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span>, and the other
killing Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there were </span>only
one <span style="">shot killing both <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> </span>and <span style="">Hernandez,
there would have been a com­plex crime, double murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second class, obviously, does not cover
the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of the
considered opinion that the appellant is guilty of two separate </span>and <span style="">distinct murders and that he should suffer
the penalty for each murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant </span>contends
<span style="">that the qualifying circumstances </span>of
evident premeditation <span style="">and treachery did
not exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is tenable
with respect to evident premedita­</span>tion because the appellant <span style="">only had about half </span>an hour <span style="">(1:30 to 2:00 A.M.) for meditation </span>and
<span style="">reflection from </span>the time he left
the house, went to his camp, put on his fatigue uniform, got a <span class="SpellE">garand</span> rifle and returned to said house, followed the <span class="SpellE">serenaders</span> a short distance and then fired the two
shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time in the circumstances was
insufficient for full meditation and reflection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was insufficient, in the juridical sense, for
his conscience to overcome the resolution of his will had he desired to hearken
to its warning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is
untenable with respect to treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant followed the <span class="SpellE">serenaders</span> as they walked,
made no indication that he would shoot, and then sud­denly fired from behind
two shots in rapid succession at <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> and
Hernandez from a distance of about five meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, clearly there was treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the generic aggravating circumstances of
abuse of public position and <span style="">ignominy </span><span style="">were not present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The contention is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing to show that the appellant
took advantage of his being a sergeant in the Philippine Army in order to
commit the crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that he
was in fatigue uniform and had an army rifle at the time is not <span style="">suffi­cient </span>to establish that he <span style="">misused </span>his public position in the
commission of the crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to
ignominy the mere fact that the appellant fired one more shot at the prostrate
body of <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> and four more shots at the prostrate
body of Hernandez is not sufficient to show the existence of said aggravating
circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends <span style="">that </span>he
should be given the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary
surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is
tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that
immediately after the commission of the murders, the appellant voluntarily
surrendered to his detachment camp commander to whom he also surrendered the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">garand</span></span> rifle, and that he was
ordered confined in the stockade.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for murder is <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u>
</span>in its maximum period to death (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being one mitigating circumstance, <span style="">vo</span>luntary surrender, the penalty for
each murder should be <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u> </span>in its maximum period
in relation to the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that the lower court erred in rejecting
his defense of <span style="">insanity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The contention lacks merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal presumption of sanity is rein­forced
by the evidence showing that when he committed the crimes, appellant was calm
and collected, and did not show any sign of anger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he fired four more shots at the
prostrate body of Hernandez, who had refused his request to be allowed to sit
beside <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>, shows that revenge was in his
heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report of Dr. Cesar <span class="SpellE">Catindig</span> of the V. Luna General Hospital where appellant
was confined for one month by order of the trial court does not show that
appellant was insane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely shows
that he was<span style=""> </span>suffering from
psychoneurotic depressive reaction and psychoneurotic <span class="SpellE">dissociative</span>
reaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report, however,
concludes:</p>

<blockquote>"In the absence of reliable information it could not be
ascertained whether the crime imputed to him was committed when he was in such
a state of mind."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That part of the judgment
below awarding compensatory</span> damages in the amounts of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the heirs of Angel <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span>
and P6,000 to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> Hernandez should
be modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1947, when the Project
of Civil Code was drafted, the Code Commission fixed the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000</span> as the minimum amount of compensatory damages for death
caused by a crime or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Project of Civil Code was approved by
both Houses of the Congress in 1949 as the New Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which took effect <span style="">in </span>1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1948 in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span>, <span style="">80 </span>Phil.
424, the Supreme Court awarded P6,000 as compensatory damages for death caused
by a crime "con­sidering the difference between the value of the present
currency and that at the time when the law fixing <span style="">a </span>minimum indemnity of P2,000 was
enacted." The law referred to was Commonwealth Act No. 284 which took
effect in 1938.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1948, the purchasing
power of the Philippine peso was one-third of its pre-war purchasing
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1950, when the New Civil Code
took effect, the minimum amount of compensatory damages for death caused by a
crime or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> was fixed in Article 2206 of
the Code at P3<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The </span>article repealed by <st1:place><st1:placename>implication</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Commonwealth</st1:placetype></st1:place> Act No.284.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, from the time the New Civil Code took
effect, the Courts could properly have awarded P9<span class="GramE">,000</span>
as compensatory damages for death caused by a crime or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is common
knowledge that from 1948 to the present (1968), due to economic circumstances
beyond governmental control, the purchasing power of the Philippine peso has
declined further such that the rate of exchange now in the free market is
U.S.$1.00 to almost P4.00 Philippine pesos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This means that the present purchasing power of the Philippine peso is
one-fourth of its pre-war purchasing power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that the amount of award of
compensatory damages for death caused by a crime or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
should now be P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, we should point out that, in proper cases,
besides compensatory damages in the sum of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
the courts may also award additional sums as further com<span style="">pensatory </span>damages <span style="">for
loss of earnings and for support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
courts may likewise award additional sums as moral damages and as exemplary
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Arts. 2206 and 2230, New Civil
Code.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b><span style="">,
</span>the judgment of the court below is hereby modified by: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>1. Sentencing the appellant for each murder to
an indeterminate penalty of from 15 years to 20 years; 2. Ordering the
appellant to pay the heirs of Angel <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> the sum
of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> as compensatory damages, and to pay the
