defendants Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company received a shipment
of 58 packages of "coal tar dyestuffs" from the S/S "Buenos

Inc. in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June </span><span style="">5, 1961 </span><span style="">the consignee, which failed to receive one package, filed </span>a <span style="">provisional claim with the defendants
"for cargoes landed in bad order condition </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">short-landed"
under </span>the provisions <span style="">of par. 15
of the <span class="GramE">management</span> contract</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" * * * the CONTRACTOR shall be <span style="">solely </span>responsible as an independent contractor for, and
promptly pay to the steamship company, consignee, <span style="">consignor, or </span>other interested party or parties the invoice val<span style="">ue </span>of each package but which <span style="">in no case shall </span>be more than five
hundred pesos (P500.00) for each package unless the value is otherwise
specified or manifested, and the corresponding <span class="SpellE"><span style="">arrastre</span></span><span style=""> charges had </span>been paid, * * * <span style="">In </span>any event the<span style="">

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This was followed on
March 22, 1962 by a </span><span style="">formal claim
stating the nature </span><span style="">of the loss
and the value thereof in the amount of P600.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="6"><span style="">June 27,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the plaintiff
Alpha Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., as </span><span style="">insurer </span><span style="">subrogated to
the rights of the consignee, was advised in writing by </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">defendants that its claim, because of the insurer's failure to bring suit
within one year from the date of discharge of the goods, has prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6"><span style="">June 29,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style=""> the plaintiff
filed the present action </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the municipal court of Manila to recover the
value of the missing cargo, plus legal interest thereon, P500 as attorney's
fees and for expenses of litigation, and costs of suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">basis of a written
stipulation of facts submitted by the parties, the municipal court rendered
judgment in favor of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila, upon the <span style="">same written stipulation of facts, rendered
judgment<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"* * * sentencing the defendants to pay jointly and severally
to the plaintiff the sum of P500.00 with interest thereon at the legal rate
from the date of the filing of the complaint in the Municipal Court on <span style="">June 29, 1962, until the whole amount shall
have been fully </span>paid, plus ten percent of the total amount due <span style="">as and for attorney's fees, and the costs of
this action."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. The appellants' first contention is that the provisional claim
filed on June <span style="">5, 1961 </span>is not the
claim contemplated by paragraph 15 of the management contract, which requires
that the same be "one for value"; and that it is "not only
vague, but purely speculative in character" and is <span style="">a </span><span style="">mere </span><span style="">"advice" of an anticipated
loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This contention is <span style="">without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the provisional claim did not indeed
indica</span>te the value of the missing cargo, it <span style="">nevertheless contained a description </span>of the importation
involved, sufficient <span style="">to place the
defendants on notice as to the amount and character thereof, and provide them
with ample basis for reasonable </span><span style="">verification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">These
circumstances, we ha</span><span style="">ve</span><span style=""> already held, constitute </span><span style="">substantial </span><span style="">compliance with paragraph 15 of the management contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"although without statement as to amount and without
accompanying documents, the provisional claims herein involved contained
descriptions of the importations concerned, sufficient to allow the Manila Port
<span style="">Service reasonable verification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not have been difficult for defendant
Manila Port Service to check on whether some or all of cargo therein described
were in fact missing or in bad </span><span style="">order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is supposed </span><span style="">to have a complete and detailed recording or
checking </span><span style="">of said cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The particulars of the precise amount </span><span style="">of indemnity claimed as well as the
supporting papers for said claim were properly reserved for the formal claim
thereafter filed, since the determination and preparation </span><span style="">of the same by the consignee should be </span><span style="">done carefully and without haste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisional claims in question therefore
served the purpose of </span><span style="">enabling </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operator to check the goods </span><span style="">in
its possession, shortly after they </span><span style="">had
been dis</span><span style="">charged </span><span style="">from their </span><span style="">carrier."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whatever deficiency there
was in the provisional claim was supplied by the subsequent formal claim of
March 22, 1962 which stated ''the nature of the loss </span><span style="">and the value </span><span style="">thereof in the amount of P660.00."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2. The next contention of the appellants that the provisional claim
was not against <span style="">them but against the
carrier, </span>is refuted by those portions of the written stipulation of
facts that unequivocally state that the "shipment consisting of 58
packages of Coal Tar Dyestuffs was received by the defendants complete and all
in good order condition" and that the defendants "failed to deliver
to the consignee one (1) package."</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The appellants' final contention that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
erred in not holding that the period of one year within which suit may be <span style="">brought against them had already expired when
the complaint was filed on June 29, 1962, is likewise completely without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Paragraph 15 of the
management contract provides two alternative periods in reference to an action
to be filed to enforce liability for loss or damage:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) one year from the date of last discharge
of the goods, or (2) one year from the date the claim is rejected or denied by
the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator, provided, however, that a
provisional claim shall have been previously filed with said operator within 15
days from the date of last discharge </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">the carrying
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first period refers to a
case where the claimant files an action in court without awaiting the
contractor's pleasure on the claim, in which event the action should be filed
within one year from the date of last discharge from the carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second period applies where the claimant
prefers to wait for definitive action by the operator, in which event the
action should be filed within one year from the date of rejection.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Where, however, the operator neither honors
nor rejects the claim within one year from the date of last discharge, the
claim is deemed rejected as of the expiry date of the said <span class="GramE">period,</span>
and the action may be filed within one year from the said expiry date.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The plaintiff's claim was
neither rejected nor denied orally or in writing by the defendants within one
year from the date of last discharge on May 28, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on June 27, 1962 that the
plaintiff received a letter from the defendants informing it that its claim had
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
claim must be deemed to have been rejected only on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="3"><span style="">March </span><span style="">28, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">in which case the acquisition should be filed within one year <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The complaint which was filed on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6"><span style="">June 29,
 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, or less than
one year from </span><st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="3"><span style="">March 28, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, is therefore not time-barred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
