EMILIANA MENDOZA, FOR HERSELF AND IN REPRESENTATION OF HER MINOR CHILDREN ENCARNACION AND LUCILA, BOTH SURNAMED BELLEZA AND TEODORICO ONA, HEARING OFFICER, REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 5, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, SAN PABLO CITY, RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Emiliana Mendoza and her children Encarnacion and
    Lucila, were the wife and children, respectively, of Ernesto
    Belleza, employed with the M/S Cinderella, a ferry boat,
    registered in the name of Marcelo E. Cruz, father of petitioners herein. On August 30, 1954, Marcelo E. Cruz died
    and his estate was the subject of Special Proceeding No.
    2068 of the CFI of Rizal, presented on October 13, 1954.
    On November 29, 1954, the intestate court issued an Order,
    requiring claimants of the estate to file notices of claim
    within six (6) months from the first publication. The
    Order was published in the Manila Times on December 2,
    9 and 16, 1954. 
		 <p>On March 22, 1955, while the estate was in the process
    of liquidation, but before its termination on March 13,
    1961, and the approval of the Project of Partition, Ernesto
    Belleza was killed. Notice of claim for compensation was
    presented on December 15, 1959.    </p>
		 <p>On January 25, I960, respondents (Bellezas), filed with
    the Department of Labor, San Pablo Local Office, Region
    No. 8, a complaint (RO 3 SP-WC Case No. 57), against
    Carmen Vda. de Cruz, wife of Marcelo E. Cruz, the pertinent allegations of which recite—</p>
		 <blockquote>
		   <p> "4. That on March 22, 1955, and for sometime prior to this date,
        the deceased Ernesto Belleza was employed in respondent's M/S
        'Cinderella' with the work of issuing tickets and collecting fares
        from passengers and also doing other odd jobs for the interest of
        said vessel of the respondent at Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, and
        received for his services P120.00 monthly more or less;</p>
		   <p>
5. That on March 22,1955, at around 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon,
while the deceased Ernesto Belleza was trying to untie a ship cable so
that the M/S 'Cinderella.' of the respondent may be moored at an
advantageous place in the Calapan Wharf, a trouble arose between Carlos
Ronquillo of the M/S 'BARRON' and Rufo Marasigan, Manager of the M/S
‘CINDERELLA' and M/S 'AMBASSADOR' at Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, and, in
firing made by Carlos Ronquillo of his .45 Caliber pistol, Ernesto
Belleza was hit three (3) times and wounded, as a result of which he
(Ernesto Belleza) died at around 9:30 o'clock in the evening of the
same date at Calapan, Oriental Mindoro; <br></p><p style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></p>
		   <p>8. That the respondent spent for the
burial expenses of the deceased Ernesto Belleza and has paid to the
claimant Emiliana Mendoza and her aforementioned minor legitimate
children the sum of P1,230.00, thereby leaving unpaid P1,650.80 as
balance of their compensation."&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p></blockquote><p>An Answer to the above complaint,
presented on February 16, 1960, by defendants therein, contained, among
others, the following— </p><blockquote>
		   <p>"7. She admits that
portion of the allegations in paragraph 8 that the respondent (acting
in behalf of the estate of deceased M. S. Cruz), gave the claimant the
sum of P 1,230.00 and took charge of the burial expenses but denies the
portion and rest of all the allegations that the sum of P1,650.80
remains as 'balance of their compensation', the truth of the matter
being that claimant knew beforehand that said sums were in the nature
of advances which she (claimant) promised would reimburse as soon as
she recovers civil indemnification from the Court of First Instance of
Oriental Mindoro decision on the criminal case filed against the
killers of her husband deceased Ernesto Belleza;</p>
		   <p> 8. She admits the allegations in paragraph 9 but her refusal to
        further furnish financial help to the claimant was due to (1) her 
        securing favorable judgment in the aforementioned case, and (2) 
        her marriage to another man who can presently support her and
        her co-claimants;    </p>
	       <p>9.
The deceased husband of the claimant was not an 'employee' of the M/S
'Cinderella' at the supposed time of accident and the Workmen's
Compensation Act, he having been employed by an independent contractor,
Rufo Marasigan, who used to be and still is, the ticket agent in
Calapan, Oriental Mindoro for several motor boat operators; </p>
	       <p>10. The claim has patently prescribed, the death having occurred
          on March 22, 1955, according to the complaint and obviously, more
          than ninety (90) days had elapsed; </p>
	       <p>11. That respondent is not personally liable for the claim, if any,
          but the estate of the deceased Marcelo E. Cruz, owner and operator
          of the M/S 'CINDERELLA' at the supposed time of accident and the
          proper recourse on the part of the claimants is to file the claim in
          the intestate proceedings pursuant to Sec. 1, et seq., Rule 87 of the Rules of Court."</p>
</blockquote>
		 <p> On March 22, 1961, respondent Carmen D. Vda. de Cruz,
    presented a Motion to Dismiss, contending that she was
    the wrong party respondent—should have been the estate
    of Marcelo E. Cruz; and the instant claim should have been
    presented with the intestate court and against the estate.
    Claimants opposed the motion to dismiss, moved to amend
    the complaint, so as to include the widow and the children
    of the deceased Marcelo E. Cruz and set the hearing of
    the case at Calapan, Mindoro. On April 21, 1961, respondent Vda. de Cruz, filed an Opposition to the Motion to
    Amend Complaint and against motion to dismiss. The
    motions to dismiss were denied and the motion to amend
    the complaint was granted in two Orders of the Hearing
    Officer of the Regional Office, dated May 24, and June 21,
    1961, and the hearing was set for August 21, 1961, at Calapan, Mindoro.    </p>
		 <p>Claiming that the Regional Office No. 5 of the Department of Labor, thru its hearing Officer, respondent
    Teodorico Ona, was without or exceeded its jurisdiction
    and/or committed grave abuse of discretion in taking;
    cognizance of the claim, in denying the motions to dismiss
    and setting the case for hearing, for which there is no
    appeal nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the
    ordinary course of law, petitioners brought the matter to
    this Court on a writ for prohibition with Preliminary
    Injunction. We gave due course to the petition, but without preliminary injunction.    </p>
		 <p>As gathered from the different pleadings, the dominant
    issues which need determination are: (1) Whether the
    Regional Office No. 5 of the Department of Labor, Workmen's Compensation Commission, has jurisdiction to take
    cognizance of the claim for compensation; and (2) Whether
    the claim has already prescribed?    </p>
		 <p>Petitioners contend that since the claim arose at a time
    when the estate of Marcelo E. Cruz was the subject of
    intestate proceedings, the same should have been presented
    in the regular courts. In support of the above contention,.
    petitioners cited Sec. 5, Rule 87, which provides—</p>
		 <blockquote>
		   <p>
"All claims for money against the decedent arising from contract,
express or implied, whether the same be due, not due, or contingent,
all claims for funeral expenses and expenses of the last sickness of
the decedent, and judgment for money against the decedent, must be
filed within the time limited in the notice, otherwise they are barred
forever, except that they may be set forth as counterclaims in any
action that the executor or administrator may bring against the
claimants. * * *"</p>
</blockquote>
		 <p>We are, however, of the opinion that the above provision
          of law has no application to the case at bar. This is a case
          properly belonging to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
          Workmen's Compensation Commission. The deceased died
          in an accident arising out of and in the course of his
          employment (section 2, of Act No. 3428, as amended).
          The Workmen's Compensation Law is a special law, and
          outlines or prescribes the requisites and procedure to be
          followed in cases coming under its aegis (sec. 48, same
          Act). Being a special law covering special cases, same
          should govern to the exclusion of general rules or laws,
          provisions of sec. 1, Rule 87, to the contrary notwithstanding. The history and objectives in the enactment of the
          Workmen's Compensation Law take this case away from
          the provisions of the general laws. The regular courts
          may only intervene in the prosecution of Workmen's Compensation, in the case of execution of a final judgment of the
          Workmen's Compensation Commission, in the manner
          provided by section 51, of same Act. Moreover, the Rules		
		          
				
				          
		
		          of Court are merely suppletory if the case is not provided
          for by other laws, like the present one (Rule 132). </p>
		 <p>It would be a sad day in the odyssey of the deserving
    man of labor, to be deprived of his right to redress his
    grievances, if, for doubtful technicalities, he should be
    thrown out of Court. The complaint shows the existence
    of a valid cause of action, if the allegations therein are
    true. The petitioners had answered and put up affirmative
    defenses, which need to be ventilated in a trial in order to
    decide the case with justice. The grounds of the motion
    to dismiss are not indubitable. The respondents-claimants
    should be given the opportunity to prove their case.    </p>
		 <p>In the regular courts, the claim of respondents had long
    been barred. Of this, the petitioners are fully aware. But
    the Workmen's Compensation Commission can still throw
    a beam of hope to respondents.    </p>
		 <p>Petitioner argues that the action has prescribed, because
    the claim had been filed beyond the reglementary period
    (three months from the occurrence of the accident). The
    complaint, however, alleges that the petitioners spent for
    the burial of the deceased and after the burial, had paid
    the claimants the sum P1,230.00 out of the estimated compensation of P2,880.00 plus P200.00 for burial expenses,
    in accordance with secs. 8 and 10, of the W.C. Law, thereby
    leaving an unpaid balance of P1,650.80, which is the one
    being claimed now. If this allegation is true, "the claim
    for compensation to be made within the time limits above
    established shall no longer be necessary" (sec. 24, Act No.
    3428, as amended).    </p>
		 <p>In view of the conclusions reached, other questions
      raised, need not be discussed.</p>
		 <p> The petition is dismissed, for lack of merits. The orders
        sought to be reviewed hereby are affirmed. Costs taxed
        against petitioners.</p>
