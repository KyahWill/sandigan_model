				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon an Information for Homicide filed before the Court of First Instance
of Isabela, Branch IV, Roxas, for the death of Abraham Cortez alias Luis
Cortez, Jr. (deceased), and after due trial, petitioner-appellant was sentenced
to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from eight (8) years and one (1) day
of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8)
months of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as maximum, to indemnify the heirs
of the deceased in the amount of P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in
case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of conviction was
affirmed but the penalty was amended as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction is hereby affirmed with
modification of the penalty from ten (10) years and one (1) day of <u>prision</u>
<u>mayor</u>, as the minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one
(1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as the maximum, and to pay an
indemnity of P12,000.00 to the heirs of the deceased, without sub­sidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears from the
evidence that the deceased was killed in the night of June 3, 1967 and that
shortly before his death, the deceased was playing cards in the house of
appellant in the municipality of San Manuel, Isabela, together with appellant,
the latter's cousin Victor Buduan, Cresencio Doctor, Fermin Esteban, and
Esmeraldo Pagatpatan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The original criminal
complaint in regard to the death of the deceased was filed against Victor
Buduan and appellant before the Municipal Court of San Manuel, Isabela, on June
7, 1967.  But because Victor Buduan
could not be arrested and had remained at large, only appellant was tried under
the Information filed before the Court of First Instance of Isabela, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 3rd day of June, 1967, in the
municipality of San Manuel, province of Isabela, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Rodrigo Dacanay,
together with Victor Buduan, who is still at large, conspiring and confede­rating
together and helping one another, did then and there will­fully, unlawfully,
and felonious­ly, with intent to kill and with­out any just motive, the said
Victor Buduan, assault, attack and stab with a scythe (lilit) one Abraham
Cortez alias Luis Cortez, Jr., while being held on his right shoulder by the
herein accused Rodrigo Dacanay, thereby inflicting the following wounds upon
the said Abraham Cortez alias Luis Cortez, Jr., to wit:  a stab wound, abdomen, penetrating and
perforating small intestines and lumbar area, right, three perforations in
small intestines, which directly caused the death of said Abraham Cortez alias
Luis Cortez Jr., due to external and internal hemorrhage secondary to the stab
wound."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The theory</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
the prosecution is that the deceased was stabbed by Buduan with a scythe
("li</span><span style="">l</span><span style="">it") while he was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">being
held by appellant from behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">  </span><span style="">On June 6, 1967, </span>or
<span style="">the day before appellant was charged
with Homicide before the Municipal Court of San Manuel, he gave a statement
before the Chief of Police of San Manuel wherein he stated that during the card
game Buduan accused the deceased, who was acting </span>as <span style="">banker, of cheating; that because of that
charge, a fight ensued between the deceased and Buduan; that in order to
separate the two, appellant held the shoulders of the deceased with his two
hands and while so doing Buduan stabbed the deceased with a scythe
("lilit").</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On June 7, 1967, after he was charged with
the crime before the Municipal Court, appellant also gave a statement before
the Municipal Judge reiterating what he had told the Chief of Police the day
previous.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the trial before
the Court of First Instance, appellant changed his story and claimed that,
during the card game, Buduan and the deceased left appellant's house together
to get chicken for "arroz caldo;" that at about 8:00 o'clock that
night, appellant was informed by a neighbor that Buduan had stabbed the
deceased while they were between the houses of Daniel Peralta and Esmeraldo
Pagatpatan; that appellant was not present during the stabbing; that he did not
bother to go outside to see the deceased and that Buduan did not come back to
his (appellant's) house after the stabbing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no doubt in our
minds that the deceased was stabbed in the house of appellant in the course of
the card game, as confirmed by appellant's statements,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and that the deceased was not killed out­side
of appellant's house as claimed by him at the trial.  It is also clear to us that the deceased was stabbed by Buduan
while appellant was holding the arms of the deceased from behind, thus making
possible Buduan's fatal stabbing of the deceased.  That was sufficiently established by the testimonies of Cresencio
Doctor and Fermin Esteban who were participants in the card game and who
declared as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The substantial question
that we have to resolve is whether appellant should be convicted as an accom­plice,
as suggested by the Solicitor General, or as a co-principal as held both by the
trial Court and the Court of Appeals.  On that question we are also finding that appellant should be convicted
as a co­-principal and not as a mere accomplice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There can be no question
that appellant's act in holding the victim from behind when the latter was
stabbed by his cousin, Victor Buduan, was a positive act towards the
realization of a common criminal intent, although the intent can be classified
as instantaneous.  It can be safely
assumed that had not appellant held both arms of the victim from behind, the
latter could have parried the thrust or even run away from his assailant.  By immobilizing the two hands of the victim
from behind, and although there was no anterior conspiracy, the two cousins
showed unity of criminal purpose and intent immediately before the actual
stabbing.  It should be stressed that
appellant and his cousin Victor Buduan were playing a card game with the
victim.  It is apparent that appellant
shared the same feeling of anger which Buduan had towards the victim who
cheated them.  If, indeed, the appellant
intended to save the victim from being assaulted with a "lilit" by
his cousin Victor, he could have grabbed his cousin and held him back, parti­cularly
the arm holding the "lilit", to prevent him from attacking the
victim.  Or, he could have placed
himself between the assailant and the victim, instead of grabbing the victim
from behind and holding both arms by the elbows rendering the victim
defenseless </span>against the assault of his cousin.  The method by which appellant seized the deceased by his elbows
from behind clearly prevented the latter from moving and defending himself, and
without said act of holding the crime would not have been accomplished. This
makes him a principal by indispensable cooperation,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> and
not merely an accomplice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule out, however, the generic aggravating cir­cumstance of
treachery appreciated by the Court of Appeals.  The attack was preceded by a quarrel and a heated discussion and must
have placed the victim on his guard.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's act in holding the deceased was impulsively done on the spur of the
moment and was not consciously and deliberately adopted.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> It
mere­ly sprang from the turn of events.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of modifying circumstances, the penalty for the
crime of Homicide, therefore, or <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, is to be
imposed in its medium period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction is hereby affirmed,
with the penalty modified to an indeterminate sentence of EIGHT (8) YEARS and
ONE (1) DAY of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS,
EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as
maximum; to pay an indemnity of P12,000.00 to the heirs of Luis Cortez Jr.,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I regret to have to dissent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue which petitioner submits as a legal ques­tion for
which this petition was given due course (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
35), is whether under the facts as found by the Court of Appeals, he was
properly convicted, it being his contention that, in the light of applicable
jurisprudence, he has not had any previous agreement with one Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, who actual­ly stabbed and killed the deceased who
admittedly died because of the fatal wound inflicted upon him by said Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> (still at large), nor joined the latter in his
criminal design, the act imputed to him being innocent or guiltless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as found by the Court of Appeals to
have been duly established by the evidence may thus be quoted from the latter's
decision, upon which to base, primarily, the determination of the plausi­bility
of petitioner's submission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>" * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
dispute on the fact that at about 8:00 in the evening of June 3, 1967, in the
house of herein appel­lant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span> at barrio <span class="SpellE">Caraniogan</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
a card game was being played by (1) Rodrigo (the appellant); (2) his cousin,
Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>; (3) <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
Esteban; (4) <span class="SpellE">Esmeraldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagatpatan</span>;
(5) <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> Doctor; and (6) the deceased Luis
Cortez, Jr. alias Abraham Cortez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution maintains that during the card game a quarrel ensued between Victor
<span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, appellant's cousin, on one hand, and Luis
Cortez, Jr., on the other, resulting into the stabbing of said Luis Cortez, Jr.
by Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> with a scythe, with the herein
appellant allegedly directly participating by holding the hands of the victim
when the latter (victim) was assaulted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The inform­ation alleges that appellant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span>,
together with Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> who is still at large,
conspired and confederated together and helped one another in the commission of
the act complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the witness
stand, appellant denied participation and alleged that it was Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> alone who stabbed Luis Cortez, Jr. causing the
latter's death (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. 117).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 1-2, Decision)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Citing various cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner develops his theory that he never joined the principal accused,
Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, in the latter's intention to kill the
deceased, or any criminal design, and so, he is not liable either as a
co-principal, or even as mere accomplice, as the Solicitor General believes to
be his correct liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general
proposition, insofar as the community of criminal purpose is concerned, what is
necessary to be shown with respect thereto as regards an accomplice, is the
same as what would be required to convict one as principal;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
although it has been held that, "an accomplice does not enter into a
conspiracy with the principal by direct participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not have previous agreement and
understanding with the principal to commit a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he participates to a certain point in the
common criminal design."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I have adverted to the ruling which provides the test for the
determination of when an accused is guilty as a mere accom­plice and not as a
principal by direct participation, as appel­lant was found to be guilty of,
because of the Solicitor General's submission that appellant's liability is
that of a mere accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I agree with
the Solicitor General as con­vincingly demonstrated by <span class="GramE">him,
that</span> appellant's liability is not that of a principal by direct
participation because of the absence of proof of a previous agreement or
conspiracy between appellant and the knife-wielder (<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
Brief, pp. 5-7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful analysis of
the evidence to determine whether appellant is liable as an accomplice as
contended by the Solicitor General, or is entitled to an acquittal, as is
sought by appel­lant is, therefore, in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the doctrine <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> (see
footnotes 2 and 3), an examination of the duly established facts will show
neither with facility nor clarity, that petitioner had to a "certain
point" participated in the common criminal design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Soli­citor General states in his brief
that "appellant did not release his hold on the hands of the victim even
as he saw that Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> was stabbing the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that precise moment,
appellant became aware of the criminal intent of Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>
and concurred with it."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
On this premise, the Solicitor General believes appellant's liability is that
of an accomplice.</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not read the evidence in the same way as the Solicitor
General, nor, with all due respect, the majority of my brethren <span class="GramE">does</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
fails to show clearly as to engender no reasonable doubt on the matter, how
sudden was the stabbing--as suddenness was manifestly suggested by the
evidence--so as to be able to determine whether appellant had the time to
release his hold before the act of stabbing was done, as not to be held that he
cooperated with <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> or joined him in his homicidal
intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is the evidence clear as
to suggest that appellant held the victim as if to give Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> the chance to stab the victim, because appellant
knew beforehand that <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> wanted to, as he did,
stab the victim, or actually saw <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> stab the
victim, which knowing and seeing would mark the existence of an intent on the
part of petitioner to join or participate in the criminal design of <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's
holding the hands of the victim could have been to take him away from the reach
of the knife-wielder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following
question asked by the Court after a demonstration of how appellant held the
hands of the victim is believed to be significant:</p>

<blockquote>"Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>
was able to reach when he stabbed the latter (Cortez)?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the question of the Court, it would seem that what was shown
in the demonstration as observed by the trial court is that in holding the
victim's <span class="GramE">hands,</span> appellant pulled him away from Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, rather than pushed him nearer to the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least there is created here an ambiguity
as to this fact that should be resolved in favor of the appellant's claim of
having tried to separate the protagonists.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases where the accused was held guilty as co­-principal
or as a mere accomplice, the evidence offered suffi­cient basis for a finding
that said accused had a common design, or concurred therein, to harm the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of U. S. vs.
Valdez, et al., 40 Phil. 876, the victim <span class="SpellE">Allarde</span> was
followed by Valdez when he left the house where there was a gathering, upon
being upbraided by Valdez for having been a wit­ness against the latter in a
land case brought by Valdez against the victim's brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gamit</span> and others
joined <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city> in follow­ing the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Gamit</span>
held <span class="SpellE">Allarde</span> fast from behind with­out saying a word,
and while in this position, <span class="SpellE">Allarde</span> was stabbed by <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General himself vividly demon­strated
the difference between the present case and the <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"In that case, there was a standing grudge entertained by the
principal accused <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> Valdez against the victim,
such that the former told the latter that "he was a fool because he
(victim) had been a witness for his brother, <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Allarde</span>, when the latter had <span style="">a </span>suit against <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> concerning a
piece of land" (p. 877, supra).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, there was no such standing grudge between <span class="SpellE">appellat</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span> and the knife wielder Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, on the one hand, and the deceased Luis Cortez, on
the other hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>
case, both accused followed the victim when he went down the house to return to
the town and on arriving at a certain place, the two accused assaulted the
latter; whereas in the present case, the fight that resulted in the fatal
stabbing developed suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
apparent that in the Valdez case, sometime elapsed from the time Valdez made
the allusion that the victim was a fool up to the time when the assault actually
took place, during which intervening period the concert of purpose and criminal
intention between the accused Valdez and <span class="SpellE">Gamit</span> could
have been forged--a fraternal conspiracy made evident when said two accused
followed the victim down the house and up to a certain place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there was, in the present
case, no such antecedent, inci­dent and no intervening period during which a
conspiracy between appellant <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> could have been spawned and nurtured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We respectfully submit that in this present
case, we cannot in conscience support and sus­tain the existence of conspiracy,
much as we are by the nature of our office ordinarily bound to advocate the
affirmation of the judg­ment of the Court of Appeals." <span class="GramE">(pp.
7-8, Respondent's Brief; p. 85, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General apparently failed to note the fact that <span class="SpellE">Gamit</span> held the victim fast from behind, not while the
latter and Valdez were in the stance of facing each other in a heated quarrel,
which was how <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> and the victim in this case were
poised against each other, calling for someone to intervene to avert an
imminent attack coming from <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> who was the armed
protagonist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who but the
petitioner-appellant, as the owner of the house, would take on the role of the
paci­fier, as indeed, there is not the slightest hint of any motive on his part
to join <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> in the latter's intent to kill the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his affidavit (Exhibit B), petitioner-appellant stated that
Victor <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> boxed Luis Cortez, Jr., the victim,
because the latter was allegedly cheating in the card game. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If peti­tioner held the hands of Cortez, Jr.,
it could be to prevent him from retaliating and thus prevent a violent clash or
en­counter occurring in his own house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is his claim, and the Solicitor General had nothing to offer to
show the improb­ability thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General said that "appellant <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span>
was not entirely unaware of the criminal intent of <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>
(the knife-wielder)--knowledge acquired at the precise time <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>
was in the act of stabbing the deceased, which act appellant evidently saw as
he held the hands of the victim." (p. 9, Respondent's Brief) <span class="GramE">This</span>, to me, is not supported by any hard evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is precisely in the lack of clear and positive evidence that
appellant saw <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> in the act of stabbing the
victim and then appellant held the victim's hand as an act indicative of his
joining <span class="SpellE">Buduan's</span> criminal design, that I find no
reliable basis for the State's submission that appellant is at least guilty as
an accomplice, much less as a principal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's act of holding the victim's hand could, with equal
credibility, have been motivated by a desire to prevent the victim from
returning the fist-blow he received from <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, but
not to prevent the victim from evading the stab, or parrying it with his hands
because it was appellant's wish to have the thrust hit its mark with deadly
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence does not show
clearly that appellant knew of <span class="SpellE">Buduan's</span> intent to use
his scythe to stab the victim, and knowing such intent, appellant joined the
same by holding the victim's hand to make the assault fatally effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such convincing proof, the
mind cannot set at ease on the certainty that appellant had any criminal design
in common with <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> as to make him guilty at all,
as this fact has to be established beyond reasonable doubt to warrant
conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The simultaneousness of the act of stabbing with that of holding
the hands of the victim by appellant does not of itself demonstrate concurrence
of wills or unity of purpose and action (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Magcomot</span>,
13 Phil. 386, 389).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, it could
demonstrate either the presence of a unity of purpose or concurrence of wills,
on the one hand, or a desire on the part of appellant to prevent a physical and
violent encounter, on the other, as is just natural of him as the owner of the
house to prevent any crime, specially one of violence, being committed in his
dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is well-settled that
if the facts or circumstances, apparently <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>,
may equally be explained showing innocence, the evidence does not fulfill the
test of moral certainty to support conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In my humble opinion, the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts as proven
by the evidence are equally consistent with the innocence of the appellant,
particularly upon the lack of motive for him to have joined the homicidal
intent of the knife-wielder who has remained at large up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's interposing subsequently the defense of alibi in open
court which is entirely unsustainable in the face of his own sworn statement
(Exhibit B) that he held the hands of the deceased, and the testimony of state
witnesses affirming this very act of appellant, admittedly weakened his defense
of having held the hands for no other purpose than to pacify the
protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, however, remains
that appellant's affidavit (Exhibit B) is his spontaneous statement given just
after the incident, and should be assessed for veracity and truth without
injecting the alibi he interposed much later, evidently after a misguided <span class="SpellE">counselling</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General must have, likewise, felt that appellant's defense of alibi
was due to injudicious coaching possibly from appellant's counsel, from which
appellant should not be made to suffer, that he (Solicitor General) made no
reference at all to said defense in the People's Brief, entirely ignoring it,
in making his recommendation for a lesser liability in <span class="GramE">favor</span>
of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">What suggests itself for proper application in this case is the
principle that conviction must be based on the strength of the prosecution's
evidence, not on the weakness of that of the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Say that by the abandonment in open court, when appellant had already had the
benefit of counsel, of his original version as set forth <span style="">in </span>his affidavit (Exhibit B), the
evidence of the defense has been weakened, yet the prosecu­tion's evidence, by
itself, is not strong enough to support, conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown earlier, it also suffers from
weakness on vital points, such as (1) the absence of opportunity for appellant
to have nurtured the intent to join in the criminal design to kill on the part
of <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, the knife-wielder; and (2) lack of motive
on his part sufficient to induce him to join in the homicidal intent of the
actual killer, for his motive to pacify as he claimed in his affidavit (Exhibit
B), is made persuasive by his being the owner of the house where card games are
played, and is, therefore, desirous to preserve the peaceful atmosphere under
which to continue the playing of the game therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also significant that the actual killer
had gone into hiding, betraying his sense of being the one solely and
exclusively responsible for the killing, possibly fearing appellant's rage for
taking a man's life right in his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am, therefore, constrained to disagree with the Solicitor
General as well as the majority, in refusing to accept appel­lant's bid for
acquittal under the authority of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,
77 Phil. 664, where this Court held that <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> had no knowledge of the criminal design or intention
of his brother <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> of stabbing the deceased <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Magalang</span>, under the
following facts:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Sixto's</span> act of holding <span class="SpellE">Cosme's</span> neck from behind is no proof of intention to
kill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time he did not yet know
what his brother's intention was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not shown that <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> knew that his brother was
armed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> in such a sudden and unexpected manner
that one of the eye-witnesses, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Calagdan</span>, did
not even notice that <span class="SpellE">Irineo's</span> blow carried a dagger
with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
showed surprise when later he saw the blood­stained dagger of his brother <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>, and asked him 'what did you do?'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In like manner, when appellant held the hands of the deceased,
there is no positive showing that the former knew of <span class="SpellE">Buduan's</span>
intention to kill the latter, the stabbing being equally <span class="GramE">so</span>
sudden and unexpected as in the case above cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General's observation that
"appellant <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span> was not entirely unaware of
the criminal intent of <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> (the
knife-wielder)--knowledge acquired at the precise time <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>
was in the act of stabbing the deceased which act appellant evidently saw as he
held the hands of the victim, has absolutely no support in the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to concede that "at the
precise time <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span> was in the act of stabbing the
deceased" which it takes only a split second to accomplish, appellant
could have joined in the homicidal design of <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there positive evidence that
appellant saw the very act of stabbing, the Solicitor General himself merely
saying that appellant <u><span style="">evidently</span></u>
saw the act, just because prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span>
Doctor and <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Esteban testified that they saw the
act of stabbing, and on this mere assumption and conjecture, he concludes that
appellant cannot successfully pretend that he never knew, at any stage of the
assault, of the criminal design of <span class="SpellE">Buduan</span>, or that he
did not cooperate with moral or material aid in the consummation of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, I cannot see
that the <span style="">swift </span>and fast act of
stabbing may be divisible into stages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, even assuming that if the act of appellant aided in the
consummation of the crime, the aid was not knowingly nor <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
given with criminal design or intent, as had already been demonstrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, I vote to acquit the petitioner of the crime
charged, or at most, to join the Solicitor General in his recommendation that
petitioner <span class="GramE">be</span> found guilty only as an accomplice, not
as a co-principal.</p>
