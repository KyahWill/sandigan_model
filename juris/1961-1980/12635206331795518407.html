				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is beyond dispute that <span style="">a
</span>judgment of conviction in the case of a driver accused of homicide
through reckless imprudence, there being no collusion between the accused and
the offended party, conclusively binds the employer to answer subsidiarily for
the damages awarded.  So it has been
since the lead­ing case of Martinez v. Barredo.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Necessarily then, in this appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance
of Ilocos Norte holding defendant-appellant Anastacio Franco, as employer,
liable for the indemnity awarded, the plaintiffs-appellees,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> the
heirs of the deceased who met his death <span style="">as
a </span>result of being run over by <span style="">a
</span>driver of a passenger truck owned by defendant-appellant <span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">and thereafter
prosecuted and convicted for the crime of homicide through reckless imprudence,
the only way responsibility may be avoided by defendant-appellant for the amount
in question is for a legal defense sufficient in law to defeat such a
claim.  He would invoke prescription,
basing his defense on the fact that it took plaintiffs-appellees five years and
eleven months after the accident, but hardly over a year after the finality of
the judgment of conviction for such crime by the Court of Appeals.  On its face, such a defense is without
merit.  So the lower court held.  It is the only legal issue raised in this
appeal before us.  The lower court must
be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">From
the stipulation of facts, it was shown that defendant was authorized to operate
units, trucks or buses for public convenience within the province of Ilocos
Norte; that one of his buses driven by his employee, the driver, Leonardo
Cabaron, ran over a child, Nonito Andres, on January 11, 1958 </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">resulting </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">in his
death.  Thereafter, on May 23, 1958,
Leonardo Cabaron was accused in a criminal case for homicide through reckless
imprudence and convicted by the Court </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">of First Instance of Ilocos </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">Norte, which
judgment was affirmed on appeal in September 1962 by the Court of Appeals.  Then came the complaint filed on December
12, 1963 where, in addition to the amount of P6,000.00 given as indemnity,
moral damages, attorney's fees and exemplary damages were sought by plaintiffs-appellees.  Even in the lower court the defense </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">raised was </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">that of
prescription.  A judgment was rendered
by the Court </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">of First </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">Instance of
Ilocos Norte on October 5, 1965, ordering that </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">the amount </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">of P6,000.00, the indemnification awarded the
plaintiffs-appellees as heirs in the criminal case against the driver, Leonardo
Cabaron, be paid by defendant to such plaintiffs-appellees.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">Hence
this appeal on a question of law, with defendant-appellant expressly submitting
"that the one and only legal issue to be resolved" by this Court
"is [whether or not the instant case has already prescribed]." As was
made clear at the outset, the answer cannot be in doubt.  No case for prescription has been made out.  The finality of the judgment of the Court of
Appeals affirming the conviction of the driver must have come at the earliest
in October 1962 in a decision having been promulgated<span style=""> </span>in September of that year.  It was only then that there is </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">a legal </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="">basis for the
claim against defendant-appellant as employer.  As of that time there was no more question as to his subsidiary </span></span><span style="">liability.  The judgment against him had become final and conclusive.  The assertion therefore that the civil
action filed on December 12, 1963, scarcely a year after the right against the
employer had accrued, cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be considered as
having prescribed.  The defense of pres­cription
is devoid of any support in law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While there is no such pronouncement to this effect, Manalo v.
Robles Transportation Company, Inc,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> necessarily
points to the conclusion that where a criminal action has been filed for
homicide through reckless imprudence against the driver of the vehicle
responsible for such mishap, the codal provision requiring that the action
based on quasi-delict be instituted within four years is not applicable.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the accident happened on August 9, 1947 and it was not until
February 17, 1953, or after a period of more than five years, that the parents
of the deceased filed the action against the defendant-owner and operator of a
taxicab for his subsidiary liability after the driver had been prosecuted and
convicted for homicide through reckless imprudence.  There is no allegation nor can it be shown that the criminal
action was not filed within the prescriptive period.  The conclusion that prescription can not be relied upon as a
defense is unavailing and is solidly buttressed in law.  It may be stated further that since it was
not only in the latter part of October 1962 that the decision against the driver
attained finality and became executory, had plaintiffs relied on suing out a
writ of execution against the employer, it could have had until October 1967 at
the latest to take such a step.  Since
clearly the case was filed on December 12, 1963, there is thus added
reinforcement to the decision of the lower court that there is no legal bar to
holding defendant-appellant subsidiarily liable to plaintiffs in this case.</p>
