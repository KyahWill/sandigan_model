				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction, petitioners challenge the validity of Rule 168 of the "Revised Rules of Practice before the Philippine Patent Office in Trade-mark Cases" as amended, authorizing the Director of Patents to designate any ranking official of said office to hear "<i>inter partes</i>" proceedings.&nbsp; Said Rule likewise provides that "all judgments determining the merits of the case shall be personally and directly prepared by the Director and signed by him." These proceedings refer to the hearing of opposition to the registration of a mark or trade name, interference proceeding instituted for the purpose of determining the question of priority of adoption and use of a trade-mark, trade name or service-mark, and cancellation of registration of a trade-mark or trade name pending at the Patent Office.<br><br>Petitioners are parties, respectively, in the following opposition, interference and cancellation proceedings in said Office:&nbsp; <i>Inter Partes</i> Cases Nos. 157, 392, 896, 282, 247, 354, 246, 332, 398, 325, 374, 175, 297, 256, 267, 111, 400, 324, 114, 159, 346, and 404.<br><br>Under the Trade-mark Law (Republic Act No. 166), the Director of Patents is vested with jurisdiction over the above-mentioned cases.&nbsp; Likewise, the Rules of Practice in Trade-mark Cases contains a similar provision, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"168.&nbsp; <i>Original jurisdiction over inter partes proceedings.</i>&nbsp; — The Director of Patents shall have original jurisdiction over <i>inter partes</i> proceedings.&nbsp; In the event that the Patent Office should be provided with an Examiner of Interferences, this Examiner shall have the original jurisdiction over these cases, instead of the Director.&nbsp; In the case that the Examiner of Interferences takes over the original jurisdiction over <i>inter partes</i> proceedings, his final decision shall be subject to appeal to the Director of Patents within three months of the receipt of notice of decisions.&nbsp; Such appeals shall be governed by sections, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 22 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court insofar as said sections arc applicable and appropriate, and the appeal fee shall be P25.00."</blockquote><br>The Rules of Practice in Trade-mark Cases were drafted and promulgated by the Director of Patents and approved by the then Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Director of Patents, with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, amended the afore-quoted Rule 168 to read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"168.&nbsp; <i>Original jurisdiction over inter partes proceedings.</i>&nbsp; —&nbsp; The Director of Patents shall have original jurisdiction over <i>inter partes</i> proceedings.&nbsp; [In the event that the Patent Office is provided with an Examiner of Interferences, this Examiner shall then have the original jurisdiction over these cases, instead of the Director.&nbsp; In the case that the Examiner of Interferences takes over the original jurisdiction over <i>inter partes</i> proceedings, his final decisions shall be subject to appeal to the Director of Patents within three months of the receipt of notice of decision.&nbsp; Such appeals shall be governed by Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 22 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court insofar as said sections are applicable and appropriate, and the appeal fee shall be P25.00.] Such <i>inter partes</i> proceedings in the Philippine Patent Office under this Title shall be heard before the Director of Patents, any hearing officer, <i>or any ranking official of the office designated by the Director, but all judgments determining the merits of the case shall be personally and directly prepared by the Director and signed by him.</i>" (Italics supplied.)</blockquote><br>In accordance with the amended Rule, the Director of Patents delegated the hearing of petitioners' cases to hearing officers, specifically, Attys. Amando Marquez, Teofilo Velasco, Rustico Casia and Hector Buenaluz, the other respondents herein.<br><br>Petitioners filed their objections to the authority of the hearing officers to hear their cases, alleging that the amendment of the Rule is illegal and void because under the law the Director must personally hear and decide <i>inter partes</i> cases.&nbsp; Said objections were overruled by the Director of Patents, hence, the present petition for <i>mandamus</i>, to compel the Director of Patents to personally hear the cases of petitioners, in lieu of the hearing officers.<br><br>It would take an extremely narrow reading of the powers of the Director of Patents under the general law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and Republic Acts Nos. 165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and 166<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3-A]</sup> to sustain the contention of petitioners. Under section 3 of RA 165, the Director of Patents is "empowered to obtain the assistance of technical, scientific or other qualified officers or employees of other departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the Government, including corporations owned, controlled or operated by the Government, when deemed necessary in the consideration of any matter submitted to the Office relative to the enforcement of the provisions" of said Act. Section 78 of the same Act also empowers "the Director, subject to the approval of the Department Head", to "promulgate the necessary rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of all business in the Patent Office." The aforecited statutory authority undoubtedly also applies to the administration and enforcement of the Trade-mark Law (Republic Act No. 166).<br><br>It has been held that power conferred upon an administrative agency to which the administration of a statute is entrusted to issue such regulations and orders as may be deemed necessary or proper in order to carry out its purposes and provisions may be an adequate source of authority to delegate a particular function, unless by express provisions of the Act or by implication it has been withheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> There is no provision either in Republic Act No. 165 or 166 negativing the existence of such authority, so far as the designation of hearing examiners is concerned.&nbsp; Nor can the absence of such authority be fairly inferred from contemporaneous and consistent Executive interpretation of the Act.<br><br>The nature of the power and authority entrusted to the Director of Patents suggests that the aforecited laws (Republic Act No. 166, in relation to Republic Act No. 165) should be construed so as to give the aforesaid official the administrative flexibility necessary for the prompt and expeditious discharge of his duties in the administration of said laws.&nbsp; As such officer, he is required, among others, to determine the question of priority in patent interference proceedings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> decide applications for reinstatement of a lapsed patent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> cancellations of patents under Republic Act No. 165,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>inter partes</i> proceedings such as oppositions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> claims of interference,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> cancellation cases under the Trade-mark Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and other matters in connection with the enforcement of the aforesaid laws.&nbsp; It could hardly be expected, in view of the magnitude of his responsibility, to require him to hear personally each and every case pending in his Office.&nbsp; This would leave him little time to attend to his other duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> For him to do so and at the same time attend personally to the discharge of every other duty or responsibility imposed upon his Office by law would not further the development of orderly and responsible administration.&nbsp; The reduction of existing delays in regulating agencies requires the elimination of needless work at top levels.&nbsp; Unnecessary and unimportant details often occupy far too much of the time and energy of the heads of these agencies and prevent full and expeditious consideration of the more important issues.&nbsp; The remedy is a far wider range of delegations to subordinate officers.&nbsp; This subdelegation of power has been justified by "sound principles of organization" which demand that "those at the top be able to concentrate their attention upon the larger and more important questions of policy and practice, and their time be freed, so far as possible, from the consideration of the smaller and far less important matters of detail."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Thus, it is well-settled that while the power to decide resides solely in the administrative agency vested by law, this does not preclude a delegation of the power to hold a hearing on the basis of which the decision of the administrative agency will be made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The rule that requires an administrative officer to exercise his own judgment and discretion does not preclude him from utilizing as a matter of practical administrative procedure, the aid of subordinates to investigate and report to him the facts, on the basis of which the officer makes his decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It is sufficient that the judgment and discretion finally exercised are those of the officer authorized by law.&nbsp; Neither does due process of law nor the requirements of fair hearing require that the actual taking of testimony be before the same officer who will make the decision in the case.&nbsp; As long as a party is not deprived of his right to present his own case and submit evidence in support thereof, and the decision is supported by the evidence in the record, there is no question that the requirements of due process and fair trial are fully met.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In short, there is no abnegation of responsibility on the part of the officer concerned as the actual decision remains with and is made by said officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It is, however, required that to "give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making determinations upon evidence the officer who makes the determinations must consider and appraise the evidence which justifies them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, while the hearing officer may make preliminary rulings on the myriad of questions raised at the hearings of these cases, the ultimate decision on the merits of all the issues and questions involved is left to the Director of Patents.&nbsp; Apart from the circumstance that the point involved is procedural and not jurisdictional, petitioners have not shown in what manner they have been prejudiced by the proceedings.<br><br>Moreover, as then Solicitor General Antonio P. Barredo, now a Member of this Court, has correctly pointed out, the repeated appropriations by Congress for hearing officers of the Philippine Patent Office from 1963<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to 1968 not only confirms the departmental construction of the statute, but also consitutes a ratification of the act of the Director of Patents and the Department Head as agents of Congress in the administration of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant petition is hereby dismissed, with costs against petitioners.<br><br><i>Castro, (Chairman), Muñoz Palma, Aquino,</i> and <i>Martin, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Sec. 78 of Republic Act No. 165 (Act creating Patent Office, etc.) "the Director, subject to the approval of the Department Head, shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations not inconsistent with law, for the conduct of all business in the Patent Office.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Sections 550, 551, 553, 554, 557 to 559 and 580, Rev.

Thus, without any statutory authority therefor and without any unlawful delegation of its power, an agency may appoint a referee to hear and report testimony." (2 Am. Jur. 2d, section 224, pp. 54-55.)<br><br>Likewise, it has been said that:<br><br><blockquote>"While particular statutes may create certain restrictions, it is generally regarded that the fact that the power to decide resides solely in the administrative agency vested by statute with such power does not preclude a delegation of the power to hold a hearing and conduct the proceedings on the basis of which the decision will be made.&nbsp; Neither does due process of law or the concept of a fair or full hearing require that the actual taking of testimony be before the same officers as are to determine the matter involved.&nbsp; Whether or not expressly authorized by statute, it is permissible, and does not render a hearing inadequate or unlawful, for an administrative agency to employ the panel method of hearing in which one or more of the members of the agency takes the testimony in the matter before the agency, or to employ other persons, such as an examiner, investigator or referee to obtain the evidence and conduct the hearings and make a report to the agency upon which the agency makes its decision.&nbsp; Such a procedure is a practical necessity."
