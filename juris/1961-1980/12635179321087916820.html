<p class="BODY">On various dates - between April 11, 1960 and January 9, 1961 -
the Asian Surety &amp; Insurance Company, Inc. and the <span class="SpellE">Fieldmen's</span>
Insurance Company, Inc. entered into seven (7) reinsurance agreements or
treaties<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">under the general terms of which the
former, as the ceding company, undertook to cede to the latter, as the
reinsuring company, a specified portion of the amount of insurance underwritten
by ASIAN upon payment to FIELDMEN'S </span><span style="">of a </span><span style="">proportionate share of the gross rate of the
premium applicable with respect to each cession after deducting a
commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Said </span><span style="">agreements or treaties were to take effect
from certain specific dates and were to be in force until cancelled by either
party upon previous notice of at least three (3) months by registered mail to
the other party, the cancellation to take effect as of the 31st of December of
the year in which the notice was given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, 1961 FIELDMEN'S, by means of registered mail,
served notice to ASIAN of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> desire to be
relieved from all participation in its various treaties with the latter
effective December 31, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
communication, although admittedly received by ASIAN on September 25, 1961, did
not elicit any reply from ASIAN.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 7, 1961
FIELDMEN'S sent another letter </span>to ASIAN expressing regrets at alleged
violations committed by the latter with respect to the various treaties between
them; in the same letter, FIELDMEN'S reiterated its position that it would
consider itself "no longer at risk for any reinsurance and/or
cession" given by ASIAN which might be in force on December 31, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having received any formal reply from
ASIAN, FIELDMEN'S sent anew a letter on February <span style="">17, 1962 reminding ASIAN of the December <span style="">7 letter </span></span><span style="">regarding </span><span style="">the cancellation
of all the reinsurance treaties and cessions as of December 31, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the <span style="">same time FIELD</span>MEN'S requested ASIAN to <span style="">submit its </span></span><span style="">final accounting </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">all </span><span style="">cessions made </span><span style="">to the former for <span style="">the preceding
months when </span>the reinsurance agreements <span style="">were in force.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile one <span style="">of the
risks reinsured with FIELDMEN'S under Cession </span>No. 61-87, Policy <span style="">No. RI-1236, issued in </span>favor of the
Government <span style="">Service Insurance System,
became a liability </span>when the insured property was burned on February 16,
1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the policy was issued on <span style="">July 1, 1961, it was supposed to expire on
July 1, 1962.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The next day, </span>February 17, <span style="">ASIAN immediately notified FIELDMEN'S of said
fire loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on February 26, 1962,
ASIAN sent its reply stating, among other things, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>we beg to reiterate that your letter of
December 7, 1961, terminating said treaties by December 31, 1961, <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">in </span>accordance with the terms thereof, since there was no prior
three months notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How ever,
considering the attitude express (sic) <span style="">in
your aforesaid letter of December 7, 1961, we are willing to waive provision
that said treaties maybe cancelled on December 31st of any year, and will
consider them cancelled at the end of three (3) months from December 7, 1961,
by which time we shall be able to render the final accounting you desire."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">FIELDMEN'S, relying on the sufficiency of its notice of
termination dated September 19, 1961 and obviously bent on avoiding its
liability under the reinsurance agreements with ASIAN, filed a petition for
declaratory relief with <span style="">the Court of
First Instance of Manila to seek a declaration that all the reinsurance
contracts entered into between them had terminated as of December 31, 1961 and
to obtain an order directing ASIAN to render a final accounting of the
transactions between them with respect to said reinsurance treaties as of the </span><span style="">cut-off date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
its answer below </span>ASIAN denied having received FIELDMEN'S letter dated
September 19, 1961; and argued that even assuming it did, FIELDMEN'S could not
have terminated the reinsurance treaties as of December 31, 1961 because the
letter was merely an expression of FIELDMEN'S desire to cancel the treaties and
not a formal notice of cancellation <span style="">as </span>contemplated in their reinsurance
agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of special defense
ASIAN contended that even if the September 19 letter were considered sufficient
notice of cancellation - thereby rendering the reinsurance agreements
terminated as of December 31, 1961 - the lia­bility of FIELDMEN'S with respect
to policies or cessions issued under two of the said agreements (marked as
Annexes A and B) prior to their cancellation continued to have full force and
effect until the stated expiry dates of such policies or cessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 4, <span style="">1962 the
trial court rendered a decision declaring six</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the seven<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
reinsurance agreements in question cancelled as of December 31, 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, it upheld ASIAN'S position
that all cessions of reinsurance made by it to FIELDMEN'S prior to the
cancellation of the reinsurance treaties continued in full force and effect
until their expiry dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same decision
also ordered FIELDMEN'S to make an accounting of its business transactions with
ASIAN within 30 days, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On Appeal to the Court of Appeals, the decision of the trial
court was <span style="">substantially affirmed, </span>with
the slight modification that the order for <span style="">accounting was eli­</span>minated, without prejudice to the filing of a
proper action between the parties for that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cancellation as of December 31, 1961 of the reinsurance
treaties involved in this case <span style="">is </span>not
now in issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was declared by both
the trial court and the Court of Appeals, and has not been challenged
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main controversy between the
parties is on the question of whether or not said cancellation had the effect
of terminating also the liability of FIELDMEN'S as reinsures with respect to
policies or cessions issued prior to the termina­tion of the principal
reinsurance contracts or treaties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Of
the six reinsurance contracts under consideration </span><span style="">two contain provisions which clearly and
expressly recognize the continuing affectivity of policies ceded under them for
reinsurance notwithstanding the cancellation of the contracts themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as already noted hereinabove, Article
10 of the Facultative-Obligatory Reinsurance Treaty Fire (Annex A to the
petition below) provides "that in the event of termination of this
Agreement <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>, </span>the liability of the <span class="SpellE">Fieldmen<span style="">’s</span></span> under current cessions <u>shall
continue in full force and effect <span style="">until
their natural expiry x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span></u></span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">x</span></u></span><span style="">;" </span><span style="">and the 4th
paragraph of Article VI of the Personal Accident Reinsurance Treaty (Annex B to
the petition below) states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the
termination of this Agreement from any cause whatever, the liability of the
REINSURER (<span class="SpellE">Fieldmen's</span>) under any current cession
including any amounts due to be ceded under the terms of this Agreement and
which are not cancelled in the ordinary course of business <u>shall continue in
full force until </u><u><span style="">their expiry</span></u><span style=""> unless the COMPANY (Asian) shall, prior to
the thirty-first December next following such notice, elect to withdraw the
existing cessions, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the two reinsurance agreements with the express
stipulations <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> are concerned, there is
clearly no merit in FIELDMEN'S claim that their cancellation carried with it <u>ipso</u><span style=""> </span><u>facto</u> the termination of all
reinsurance cessions there under.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
cessions continued to be in force until their respective dates of
expiration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it was under one of
said agreements, namely, the Facultative-Obligatory Reinsurance Treaty-Fire,
that the reinsurance cession corresponding to the GSIS policy had been made,
FIELDMEN'S cannot avoid liability which arose by reason of the burning of the
insured property.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the other
four agreements, it would seem that the petition for declaratory relief is </span>moot,
and that no useful purpose would be served by defining the respective rights
and obligations of the parties there under.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said agreements have been cancelled, and it does not appear that any
claim by or liability in favor of the insured has actually arisen under any of
the reinsurance cessions made prior to such cancellation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Future conflicts of the same nature as those
which have motivated the present action can of course be obviated by using more
precise and definite terminology in the reinsurance agreements which the
parties may enter into henceforth.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note in this connection:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that in ASIAN’S answer to the petition
below, particularly to the allegation in paragraph III concerning the right of
either party to terminate the reinsurance agreements upon at least three months
notice, such termination to take effect on the 31st of December of the year in
which notice was given, ASIAN made express reference only to the provisions in
the two agreements marked as Annexes A and B to the petition that "the
liability of FIELDMEN'S under any current cession ... shall continue in full
force and effect until their natural expiry...;" (2) that the same
provisions, and no other, were relied upon <span style="">as a </span>special defense on the question
of FIELDMEN'S continued liability; and (3) that in ASIAN'S prayer for relief in
its answer it was only with respect to those two agreements that ASIAN asked
for a declaration that the cessions on reinsurance issued prior to their
cancellation would continue in full force and effect until their natural
expiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, ASIAN was quite
willing that no similar declaration be made by the <span style="">Court with respect to the other agreements, obviously be­</span>cause no
risk reinsured pursuant thereto had become an actual liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since those agreements had been cancelled
as of <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1961</st1:date>,
there <span style="">is no point in </span>the prayer
for declaratory judgment concerning them.</p>

<p class="BODY">FIELDMEN'S insists on its alternative prayer that all cessions
under the <span style="">six reinsurance agreements </span>be
declared rescinded by reason of <span style="">certain
violations thereof, as stated </span>by FIELDMEN'S <span style="">in </span>its letter of December <span style="">7, </span>1961.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This action, however, is
not one for rescission but merely for declaratory relief, and the petition
contains </span>no averments, which would constitute grounds for
rescission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither are there any
findings of fact <span style="">in </span>the decision
of the Court of Appeals upon which rescission may be predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anything, the thrust of said decision <span style="">is </span>that ASIAN was not guilty of any
substantial breach of the contracts, which would warrant such a step.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this conclusion, being factual in nature,
<span style="">is </span>binding and conclusive upon
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from <span style="">is </span>affirmed insofar as it refers to
the Facultative-Obligatory Reinsurance Treaty and the Personal Accident
Reinsurance Treaty are concerned, and modified with respect to the others by
declaring the issues concerning them as moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
