of the </span><span style="">Court of First </span><span style="">Instance of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Surigao</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">del Norte dismissing
Civil Case No. 1645 for recovery of ownership on the ground that the same is
now </span><u><span style="">barred </span></u><u><span style="">by prior judgment</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This present case is a sequel of a previous suit -- Cadastral
Case No. 12, Record No. 1364 -- for the recon­stitution o<span style="">f</span> certificates of title under Republic
Act No. 26 -- decided by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Suri­gao</span>
del Norte against <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
and denying said petition for reconstitution, which was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals in its decision dated July 30, 1964 in C.A.G.R. No. 24964-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the said previous case, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, as one of <span style="">the
</span>children of the late Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, filed
on February 13, 1952 a petition under Republic Act No. 26 for the
reconstitution of certificates of title covering lots nos. 519, 520, 1014, 1015,
1016, and 1020, alleging, among others, that Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
having died, his children formed a partnership called Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> to continue the
business of their deceased father Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>;
that the certificates of title to the said lots had also been transferred to <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> and prayed
therefore, that the transfer certifi­cates of title in the name of <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> which <span style="">had
been </span>lost or destroyed be reconstituted and the same be cancelled and in
lieu thereof transfer certificates of title <span style="">be </span>issued in the name of <span style="">the
</span>heirs of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, Jr.,
Corazon <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Yusing­co</span>,
and Patrick <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> (rec. on appeal, pp. 73-74; Deci­sion
of the Court of Appeals, C.A.G.R. No. 24964-R).</p>

<p class="BODY">The said petition was opposed by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>, as administrator of
the estate of <span style="">the </span>late <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonpin</span>, alleg­ing in effect
that <span style="">he </span>and his co-heirs are the
lawful owners and possessors of the lots covered by the certifi­cates of title
sought to be reconstituted <span style="">as </span>successors
<span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonpin</span>, who at the time of his death was the lawful owner
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due hearing, the
lower court (Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del
Norte) issued an order denying the petition for reconstitution, said denial
being predi­cated on a finding that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonpin</span> and his heirs exercised possession of the lots in
concept of owners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
appealed the order of the lower court to the Court of Appeals which was therein
docketed <span style="">as </span><span style="">G.R. No. 13033-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 29, 1955, the Court of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Appeals,
after passing upon the merits of the </span><span style="">petitioner's </span><span style="">appeal,
adopted a resolution "remanding the case to the lower court for further
reception of evidence or any ‘other or further evidence which may help in the
complete and final determination of the case’ xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span>,"
particularly as to the status of the mortgages in favor of Philippine Refining
Company and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court, as directed, received
evidence and thereafter, elevated the case to the Court of Appeals without,
however, rendering any judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the Court of Appeals, by another resolution dated November 5, 1957, remanded
the case for the second time to the lower court with specific instruc­tion for
the latter court "to render judgment in the light of all the evidence thus
presented and make a pronouncement as to whether or not the aforementioned
mortgages have already been satisfied and such other pronouncement as would be
justified by the whole evidence." Accordingly, the lower court rendered
judgment holding, among others, that "the mortgages in favor of the
Philippine Refining Company and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> were
no longer existing </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">least, insofar as their recording and
annotation on the back of the certificates of title sought to be reconsti</span><span style="">tu</span><span style="">ted is concerned; "and forthwith denied petitioner's petition for
reconstitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> appealed to the
Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a decision promulgated
on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">,
the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court (rec. on appeal,

</span><span style="">Decision of the Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 24964-R).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In affirming the decision
of the lower court, the Court of Appeals stated its findings of facts and con­clusions
thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mortgaged their undi­vided half to Luis <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> for
P10,000.00, who in turn transferred his rights as <span style="">mortgagee </span>of the aforesaid undivided halves in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>, the ones who
acquired the remaining half share of the spouses Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>

belonging to Yu <span class="SpellE">Biao</span> <span class="SpellE">Suntua</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It also appears that the <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> prior to their acquisition of the undivided half
of the property of Yu <span class="SpellE">Biao</span> <span class="SpellE">Suntua</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> had mortgaged their original undivided
one-half in favor of P.R.C. in consideration of the sum of P39,000.00 by way of
first mortgage, and later on in favor of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
in consideration of the sum of P40,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, the one-half undivided property which <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>
acquired from Yu <span class="SpellE">Biao</span> <span class="SpellE">Suntua</span>

<blockquote>"The decisive issue now to be threshed out in this proceeding
is whether there had been an extrajudicial sale held on <u>August 11, 1936</u>
by Notary Public Hernando J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span> covering the
one-half undivided interests over lots nos. 519, 520, 1014 and 1015 of the
cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, which properties were
acquired <span style="">by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> </span>for P25,000.00 and whether a
publication sale by virtue of a <u>judicial foreclosure</u> in Civil Case No.
1465 was held on <u>November 11, 1941</u> covering the remaining half interests
of the aforesaid lots of 1016 and 1020 of the same cadastral survey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the additional evidence <span style="">presented by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
which con­sisted of the deposition of Atty. J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span>,
who as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> </span>above <span style="">was the one who conducted the extrajudicial
sale covering lots nos. 519, 520, </span>1014 and 1015 which is described as
parcels Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the extrajudicial sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
4), <u>it appear that the undivided halves of the aforesaid lots were sold at
the extrajudicial sale held on August 11, 1936 by Hernando J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span> who was then commissioned as Notary Pub­lic of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> during the years 1933 to 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That by virtue of that extrajudi­cial sale,
the one-half undivided interests in lots nos. 519 520 1014 and 1015 of the
Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> were acquired by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> for P25,000.00</u>;
that all the legal requirements to conduct the extrajudicial sale, were duly
complied with by said notary public before he made the said extrajudicial sale <u>in
favor of the only highest bidder who was then Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
as shown by a copy of the document of said notary public duly identified and
marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. </u><u><span style="">4</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The mortgagor-debtor having failed to
redeem the property within the one-year redemption period, <u>a final deed of
sale was executed by the officiating officer in favor of said Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> thus making him the absolute owner of the undivided
half of the four lots (Lots No. 519, 520, 1014 and 1015), and in turn sold the
same to <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both extrajudicial sale and the corresponding
final deed of sale were duly registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds
of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> and duly annotated on the back of the
certificate of title covering the aforesaid lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are inclined to give cre­dence to this
additional evidence presented by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
relating to the actual transactions held on August 11, 1936 by the very notary
public Hernando J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span> who affirmed that all
the legal requirements to conduct said extrajudicial sale were duly complied
with before an extrajudicial sale was held and before the execution of a final
deed of sale in favor of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In giving full weight to the testimony of the
deponent Hernando J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span>, the trial court
observed that no sufficient justification (existed) to doubt the veracity of
the testimony or the facts as alleged by the deponent J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span>
who was a member of the Bar and a well-known figure, respected both in private
and public circles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the trial
court was perfectly right in considering and in giving full weight to this
additional evidence presented by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> which
consisted of the deposition of Hernando J.C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10-A).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar, they clearly show
that on <st1:date year="1936" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1936</st1:date> an
extrajudicial sale was held relating to the undivided halves of lots nos. 519,
520, 1014 and 1015.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> and his heirs assumed
possession over the property in concept of owners ever since the disputed <span style="">lots </span>were acquired by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> from Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, which aforesaid lots in question together with the
rights and <span style="">interests over the same was
subsequently sold </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> to
the late <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from taking possession </span>of the
undisputed lots the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span>
had constructed big buildings thereon, among them, the warehouses now occupied
by the <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Maritima</span>,
the General Shipping Company and the El <span class="SpellE">Oriente</span>
Hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such substantial improvements
intro­duced and strong structures built thereon are indicative that the
possessor of the lots could not obviously be a squatter in the area for no one
in his right sense would have invested so much amounts for the construction of
these buildings if the lots where the buildings are now constructed do not
belong to the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, unless of course there is
an evidence<span style=""> showing that there was a
lease </span>contract <span style="">executed between
the owner of </span><span style="">the lot as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> </span><span style="">and
the owner of </span>the building as <span style="">lessee
which has not been </span><span style="">shown in </span><span style="">this </span>case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, it is to be pointed out that
herein petitioner knew pretty well of the construction of the buildings being
undertaken by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> on the lots in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, if actually petitioner
herein still retained ownership over the lots in question they should have
protested on time and availed of the proper course of action to vindicate their
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, this <span style="">is </span>to be expected from an owner of the
land whose rights over the same had been violated or trespassed, and not <span style="">f</span>or the petitioners to have tolerated
the constructions thereof through their acquiescence and knowledge with­out
questioning the right of possession of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
at the outset over the disputed lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence shows that <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> herein ever
since the acquisition of the disputed lots through extrajudicial sale had been
in continuous possession of the premises through exclusion of herein
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, one circumstance
which may be treated as an indication that the petitioner herein had already
relinquished ownership over the disputed parcels and had not retained any right
whatsoever thereto <span style="">is </span>the
undisputed fact that he even failed to pay the corresponding taxes of the <span style="">said </span>lots, that is, if he actually
exercised an act of dominical <span style="">ownership
</span>over the lots in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Apart from the foregoing observation, our attention is
invited to such a trenchant notation appearing at the foot of <span style="">page 3 of </span>Exhibit 4 written in Spanish
which reads as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Vendido</span> en <span class="SpellE">publica</span> <span class="SpellE">subasta</span> el once <span style="">de <span class="SpellE">Agosto</span> l936.’ </span>The <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
maintain that this notation was written by the <span style="">late </span><span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span>
in his own handwriting which <span style="">contention
of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> apparently seemed to be true </span>for
a reference to this <span style="">written annotation
on this Exhibit 4 </span>and comparing the same to the handwriting of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> appearing in Exhibit
3 which has been satisfactorily established by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
to be the <span style="">penmanship </span>and
notation of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span>,
the similarity in style and penmanship on these two exhibits is evident,
indicating that both handwritings were written by one and the same hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that if no extrajudicial sale was indeed
held on August 11, 1936 there would have been no reason for <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> to have made an annotation at the foot of
Exhib­it 4.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial court that
by issuing a new certificate of title covering the disputed lots in question
will only give rise to more confusions, since it is evident that the aforesaid
lots are now held in possession and held adversely by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
who exercised ownership over the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Consequently,
</u><u><span style="">ownership </span>over the
disputed parcels cannot just be brushed aside for the evidence is indicative
that the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> therein </u><u><span style="">acquired ownership over the disputed lots </span>by
virtue of the extrajudicial sale held on August 11, 1936.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to the alleged auction sale held on November 11,
1941, relating to the remaining half over lots nos. 519, 520, 1014 and 1015 and
the whole of lots 1016 and 1020 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
which were acquired by the late <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> for P30,000.00, there is a dearth of evidence to
show the alleged auction sale or November 11, 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> and his heirs, the herein <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
had assumed possession of the premises in question and occupied the same
openly, continuously and adversely for more than twenty years in concept of
owners and above everything had constructed thereon buildings and introduced
structures of strong materials, such situation obtaining is a patent indication
of their ownership over the disputed remaining half-portion of the aforesaid
lots, especially so, when the construction thus under­taken by the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> was with the knowledge and acquiescence of
herein petitioner who mutely stood supinely and allowed the construction to be
finished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lots in question as
observed by the trial court consist of the choicest and most valuable pieces of
real estate to be found in the town of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> and if
petitioner's contention that they still retain ownership over <span style="">these lots in question is true they would not
have tolerated or agreed for the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to have
introduced sub­stantial improvements consisting of </span><span style="">buildings and other structures </span><span style="">thereon and they would not have allowed their
rights </span><span style="">to be invaded </span><span style="">or trespassed flagrantly and </span><span style="">openly without taking the </span><span style="">necessary and proper action to vindicate
their rights and interests over the disputed lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As underscored above, petitioner herein even
failed to pay the corresponding taxes due for the lots in question.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We now come to the existence of the alleged mortgage in favor
of the Philippine Refining Company and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>,

plaintiffs-appellants filed this second civil complaint (<span class="SpellE">Accion</span>

with the Court </span>of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del Norte against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, in his own

that the lots in question are registered in <span style="">the name </span>of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> under the
Land Registration Act, otherwise known as Act 496; that upon the death of
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, his children formed a partnership
called Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>
to continue the business of their deceased father, and the certificates of
title of the abovementioned lots were duly transferred to the name of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>, which title
continued to be in the name of said Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> when world War II broke out in December, 1941;
that said certificates of title <span style="">were </span>lost

herein <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> brothers were separated for which
reason the partnership known as <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> was not recons­tituted nor its business continued;
that defendant took possession of some portions of the lands in question by
surreptitiously entering the same in the absence of the <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
brothers by taking advantage of the troubled conditions during the war and
after the liberation under a false color of title and other pretenses; that
such pre­tensions of the defendant have no basis in fact because his evidence
to the alleged public auction are hazy and inconclusive and <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonpin</span> at the time of the alleged acquisition of the
lots in question until the time of his death was a <span style="">Chinese </span>citizen and being so, no title can pass to him; and
prayed therefore that defendant be ordered to vacate the premises of the lots
in question so that plaintiffs, as registered owners thereof under Act 496, can

<p class="BODY">The present case and the reconstitution suit refer to the same
subject matter -- Lots Nos. 519, 520, 1014, 1015, and 1020.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants dispute the
identity of cause of action between the two suits, for the reason that the
first action was merely for the reconstitution of cer­tificates of <span style="">title of </span>the lands in dispute, wherein
the question of possession and ownership cannot be validly passed upon; whereas
the present action is an <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>reivindicatoria</u></span>, the proper action to determine the
question of possession and ownership (pp. 29-32, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petition for reconstitution of certificates of title of
the lands in dispute, <u>appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> not only asked for the reconstitution of the
certificates of title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> but went further to pray that the certificates,
once </u><u><span style="">reconstituted, be </span>cancelled
and new ones be issued in the name of the heirs of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span></u>
(pp. 9-10, rec. on appeal in CA G.R. No. <span style="">24964-R;
pp. 73-74, </span>rec. on appeal in this case), asserting in effect their right
of ownership over the disputed parcels of lands, and the same was opposed by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>,
who also asserted his right of ownership over the lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is patent that the issue of ownership
became the determinative factor in the success of the petition for
reconstitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals in the pre­vious case for
reconstitution of titles (C.A.G.R. 24964-R), now final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>,
shows that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
endeavored to obtain judgment in their favor by proving their rights of
ownership over the disputed parcels of land <span style="">as </span>successors of the late Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
and as organizers of the Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>, while the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
claimed ownership of the same as successor of the late <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonpin</span>; and both parties freely offered evidence in
support of their respective positions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that previous petition, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> alleged that after Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
died they formed a partnership called the Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>, that they are the children of the late
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, that the certificates of title
covering the disputed lots were transferred in the name of the partnership, and
that the said certificates of title were lost and destroyed during the
war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said allegations are substantially the
same allegations made in the present <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">reivindicatoria</span></u>, wherein appellant further
alleged that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> surreptitiously took
possession of the parcels of lands during the Japanese occupation by taking
advantage of the absence of the <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that, as between the
two suits, there is identity of cause of action-- <span style="">the plaintiffs-appellant claim of ownership over the disputed lots as
opposed by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court of Appeals, in the light of the evidence
presented by both parties, was able to determine the present status of the
disputed parcels of land, the previous liens and encumbrances thereon as well
as their present real owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It traced
out how the predecessors of the herein appellants disposed of their ownership,
and how the predecessor of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lian</span> acquired ownership, over the disputed parcels of
land.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is different here is the form of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the employment of two different forms of
action, does not enable one to escape the operation of the principle that one
and the same cause of action shall not be twice liti­gated.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the parties in the
two cases are not entirely identical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only petitioner in the reconstitution <span style="">case </span>was appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, one of the heirs of the late Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
in his petition for recon­stitution he prayed that the certificates of title in
the name of <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>,
once reconstituted, be cancelled and new ones issued in the names of the heirs
of the late Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, such circumstance did not
thereby <span class="SpellE">implead</span> his co-heirs as co-petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pleadings in the recon­stitution <span style="">case </span>and the action for recovery of
ownership neither state nor intimate that <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> was autho­rized expressly or impliedly by his co-heirs
to file the petition for reconstitution for and in behalf of all the heirs of
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Court of Appeals in the said reconstitution case, CA
G.R. No. <span style="">24964, </span>therefore does
not bind his co-heirs, his co-plaintiffs in the second case for <span class="SpellE"><u>reivindicacion</u></span>; said decision therefore can only be
considered as <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>
as far as <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
is concerned, but not as against his co-heirs.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To further strengthen
their position on the question of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, plaintiffs-appellants argue that the Court

acted as a Land Registration Court of a limited and special jurisdiction

</span>(1) mutual consent of the parties or their acquiescence in submitting

(G.L. RO Case) "xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> because a </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">Land Registration Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> has no power to decide cases involving
issues properly litigable in ordinary civil actions", this Court, through
Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, citing the <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span> case,
ruled that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> Such is the general rule; but
because in this jurisdiction it is the courts of first instance that also
function as courts of land registration, our jurisprudence recog­nizes
exceptions to the rule above-stated, where the parties have acquiesced in
submitting the issues for the determination in the registration proceedings and
they are given full opportunity to present their respective sides and submit
their evidence xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span>." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Therefore, it appearing
from the records that in the previous petition for reconstitution of
certificates of title, </span><span style="">the
parties </span><span style="">acquiesced in submitting
</span><span style="">the </span><span style="">issue of ownership for determination in the
said petition, </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">they were given the full opportunity to
present their res­pective sides of the issues and evidence in support there­of,
and that the evidence presented was sufficient and adequate for rendering a
proper decision upon the issue, the adjudication of the issue of ownership was
valid and binding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being a valid
judgment, <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
applies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
plaintiffs-appellants seek to challenge the application of the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> in the
case at bar by contending that the petition for reconstitution under R.A. No.
26 is merely of an ad­ministrative nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be emphasized that R.A. No. 26 provides for <u>two ways or
methods of reconstituting certificates of title, namely, judicial </u>and
Administrative reconstitution is covered by sections 5 and 6 of the said Act
while judicial reconstitution is covered particularly by Sections 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 22 and 23 of the same Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judicial reconstitution was the method availed of by appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> in the first
case they instituted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, it must be
remembered that generally "xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span> the fundamental
principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
applies to all cases and proceedings,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> including land registration or cadastral

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>III<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The claim of ownership of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
over the disputed lots is also barred by the equitable principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, which requires the following essential elements:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>conduct on the part of the defendant, or one
under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation that led to the complaint
and for which complaint seeks a remedy;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>delay

rights, the complainant having had knowledge or notice of the defendant’s
conduct and having been afforded an opportunity to institute a suit;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>lack
of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the complainant would
assert the right on which he bases his <span style="">suit;
</span>and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>injury
or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the
complainant, or the suit is not held barred."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first element is present because the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
and their predecessors took possession in 1936 of the disputed parcels of land
and since then have been exercising acts of ownership over the same, which
constitute an inva­sion of said appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> and his predecessors' alleged rights of ownership
and possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second element is also present because from 1936 appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> could have
instituted the proper action to recover possession and ownership of the
disputed lots, but notwithstanding the invasion of their alleged rights of
possession and ownership, appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> who should have known of the intrusion into their
right of possession and ownership because of the open, adverse and continuous
possession by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and their predecessors of
the disputed lots in concept of owners, instituted a suit to recover the
disputed lots for <span style="">a </span>period of 28
years from 1936 until October 30, 1964 when the present case for recovery of
ownership was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that a
petition for reconstitution of certificates of title was filed by the appellant
<span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> on
February 13, 1952 (p. 9, second par. of the Record of Appeal of the <span style="">previous case CA G.R. 24964-R), does not
alter the situation; because even if we count as of that date (Feb. 13, 1952),
the fact of delay </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">an element of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
still obtains considering that as of that date a period of 16 years had elapsed
from 1936.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The third element is
likewise present, considering </span>that <span style="">from
the time <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonping</span> and his
predecessors took possession of the disputed lots openly, adversely and con­tinuously
in concept of owners, no voice of protest was raised by the appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is more patent when we consider the
fact that, as stated in the decision in the previous case, said appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> knew of the
construction of the buildings being undertaken by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
on the disputed lots and in spite of such knowledge never raised any protest
against the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence
hinting that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">well as their
predecessors had any notice or knowledge that appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> would assert the right on which the present
suit is based.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Clear also that the
fourth element is present in this instant case, considering that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> will, in the event relief </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">granted to the appellants, be deprived not only of the lots which they
acquired for valuable con­sideration but also of the valuable and permanent
improve­ments which they have introduced on the disputed lots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But, as in the case of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">laches</span></span><span style=""> can be taken against only plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> and not against his co-heirs who were not
the parties in the reconstitution case as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
and, therefore, should not be bound by the findings of fact and conclusions of
law of the Court of Appeals in the aforesaid reconstitu­tion case.100<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a necessary
consequence, the dismissal by the trial court thru its order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="6"><span style="">June 17,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, of the second

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING WITH RESERVATIONS</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I concur in the judgment
rendered for the Court by Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> insofar as
it overrules the defenses of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span> and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> with
regard to the petitioners other than petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, but I have grave doubts as to whether or
not the holding that <span class="SpellE">Pelagio's</span> action is barred by
said defenses is justified in the light of what appear in the records before
Us, hence my reservation as to this part of the judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Briefly stated, the first
issue to he settled here is whether or not on the basis of the facts extant in
the records, it is accurate to hold that the parties in the proceedings for the
reconstitution of the title of <span class="SpellE">Yusing­co</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> under Republic Act No. 26 within Cadastral Case
No. 12, Record No. 1364, namely, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>, on the one hand, and respondents herein, on the
other, did actually join issues on the matter of ownership of the properties in
question so as to make applicable here the exceptions jurisprudentially created
in the cases relied upon by the main opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span> and Franco.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Since the only copy of the printed record on
appeal now before Us and which was filed with the Court of Appeals </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">CA </span>GR. <span style="">No. 24964-R, the
reconstitution case, begins with the order of the lower court denying the
petition for reconstitution, and there is no showing whatsoever of the issues
raised by the parties in the petition and written opposition, if any was filed
by respondents, I do not feel morally justified to make any inference as to
what were the issues which were submitted by the parties for resolution by the
court in said proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, if
I were to infer from the order of denial alone what were the respective
positions of the parties submit­ted to the court, I would say that all that
herein peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> did was to insist that all
that mattered was the fact that it was undisputed that the last exist­ing title
over the subject properties was in the name of <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span>, and inasmuch as the same had been lost, it
should be reconstituted pursuant to Republic Act 26, with the qualification
that since the liens appearing thereon, before it was lost or destroyed, in
favor of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> and Philippine Refining had </span><span style="">already been settled and satisfied by the
predecessor-in­-interest of <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> the reconstituted title should not bear anymore
the annotation of said liens or, at the most, their cancellation should be duly
annotated, and, further, that after said reconstitution, forthwith, the court
should order that said title be split among the herein petitioners since <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> had ceased
operations as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the stand of here­in respondents was that the mortgages in favor of <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> and Philippine Refining were not paid by the <span class="SpellE">Yusingcos</span> but, on the contrary, were foreclosed <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> and their predecessors-in-interest had
acquired the same from the purchasers thereof at the foreclosure sales held on
August 11, 1936 and November 11, 1936, and upon failure of anyone to redeem the
same they took actual possession of the sub­ject properties and proceeded to
make substantial permanent improvements thereon with nary a protest on the part
of anybody, much less any of the <span class="SpellE">Yusingcos</span> up to the
time the present controversy arose in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No pretense is made that any title was ever issued in their names (re­spondents)
or that they ever interested themselves in hav­ing any issued to them, albeit
in relation to the supposed sale of August 11, 1936, there is a finding of the
Court of Appeals that the same was duly annotated at the back of the copy of
the title in the office of the Register of Deeds which was being sought to be
reconstituted, appar­ently before all the, copies were lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted, in this connection, that
no primary evidence of any kind is mentioned anywhere in the records tending to
prove said entries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the testimony
of the notary public Hernando J. C. <span class="SpellE">Corvera</span> appears
to be the basis of the findings of the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, it seems to me that the parties joined
issues only on one point, namely, as to whether or not the <span class="SpellE">Yusingcos</span>
settled or paid the mortgages <span style="">in </span>favor
of <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> and the Philippine Refining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to this pivotal issue, the finding of
the Court of Appeals affirming that of the trial court is that the mentioned
mortgages were fully paid and settled, which was precisely <span class="SpellE">Pelagio's</span>
contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the
whole decision of the Court of Appeals indicating that the settle­ment of the
said mortgages referred to by it was the re­sult of the alleged foreclosure
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is no showing at
all as to the details of the alleged fore­closure sale as regards, for
instance, the price thereof and the deficiency, if there was any.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worse, with respect to the alleged auction sale of November 11,
1936 involving the remaining half of lots 519, 520, 1014 and 1015 ad the whole
of lots 1016 and <span style="">1020, according to the
Court of Appeals, "there is a </span>dearth of evidence to show" it,
and if somehow it sustained the respondents, it was on the basis of their long
posses­sion and the alleged inaction of the <span class="SpellE">Yusingcos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">All in all, as I view this case, the evidence support­ing the
claim of ownership of the respondents is inconclu­sive and the findings of the
Court of Appeals<span style=""> </span>on this point
is not free from contradiction and confusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How can a party acquire ownership by prescription <span style="">of </span>lands registered under the Torrens
System, particularly when the basis of their claim is nothing more, than
possession and the proof of the alleged foreclosure sale by which they claim to
have acquired the property is inconclusive?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, I can­not see my way clear to considering the decision of
the Court of Appeals in <span style="">CA G. R. No. </span>24964-R
as a bar to the present action of all the <span class="SpellE">Yusingcos</span>
including <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe that the fairest thing to do is to allow the par­ties to
litigate their respective claims of ownership in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am afraid that the exception to the general
rule that reconstitution proceedings do not involve questions of ownership
which ought to be the subject of ordinary actions in the court of general
jurisdiction, if such exceptions referred to in the main opinion do really
exist, cannot be applied to the present case <span style="">in </span>which the record is not clear as to what issues were really
joined in <span style="">the reconstitution </span>proceedings
and what in concrete was the holding of the court as to the question of owner­ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I view it, the stand of <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span> is <span style="">that </span>the denial <span style="">by </span>the Land Court of his petition for
reconsti­tution was precisely without prejudice to the resolution of the issue
of ownership in the proper <span class="SpellE">revindicatory</span> action in
the court of general jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
that is precisely the present suit which the Court of Appeals has, <span style="">erroneously, in </span>my opinion, declared
barred by <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjud</span></u>icata</span> and/or <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe my
conscience would rest easier only <span style="">if </span>the
matter of <span style="">ownership </span>is properly
tried in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">concurs in the foregoing opinion of</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.</span><br>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the reservations stated in Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo's</span> concurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote, therefore, to set aside <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>
the order of dismissal of the lower court and to remand the records to the
lower court for all the <span class="SpellE">Yusingcos</span>, including <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, to pursue their action therein for <span class="SpellE"><u>reivindicacion</u></span> and to allow the parties full
opportunity to litigate therein and to present their evidence on their
respective claims of ownership over the real properties in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> has raised the
vital consideration that defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> should
not summarily, through the lower court's order of dismissal, be held in effect
to have acquired ownership by prescription of the lands admittedly registered
under the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> system in the name of appellants'
predecessor-in-interest, parti­cularly when the basis of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
claim of ownership is nothing more than mere possession and the proof of the
alleged foreclosure sale at which they allege to have acquired the property is
at best inconclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">I would add that the first case which would now be held to be <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>
against <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yusingco</span>
was a reconstitution of title proceeding instituted by <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that it is
fair and equitable to now hold likewise summarily that <span class="SpellE">Pelagio's</span>
claim of ownership over the disputed lots is also barred by the equi­table
principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> (main opinion, at page 19), when
as things stand, it would appear that such principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
should well be invoked against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
for <u>not</u> having done anything at all to transfer the title over the
disputed properties to their names, if their claim be true that they had long
acquired such at the alleged foreclosure sale.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">concurs in the foregoing opinion of </span>J. <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>.</span><br>
