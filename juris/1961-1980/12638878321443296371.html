<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal taken directly 
to this Court on questions of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts as found in the records 
may be summarized as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 10, 1931, the appellant 
<span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> sold to 
Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, under a contract of sale with right 
to repurchase, a parcel of land situated at Barrio Polo, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> (now 
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>), which lot later became known as lot No. 1563 
of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span>. The consideration 
for the sale was the sum of P800.00, and the period for redemption was to 
commence at the expiration of two years from </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Immediately upon the execution of that contract of sale with right of 
repurchase, Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> took possession of 
property and since then enjoyed the fruits <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> 
until he died. Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> died during the 
Japanese occupation, and the land in question was inherited by his son <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. Upon the 
death of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, this land was inherited by his daughter <span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. On 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 10, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> sold the 
said land to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almirañez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, for a 
consideration of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almiranez</span> and his wife 
took possession of the land upon their purchase from <span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> who was in 
possession of the same at the time of the sale. The possession of <span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> dated back from 
the death of her father <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, who had been in possession of the land from the 
death of his father Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> from whom he 
(<span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>) inherited the same. The <span class="SpellE">land</span> taxes on the land in question had been paid by Julian 
<span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> and successively by his successors in 
interest. As a matter of fact, the tax declaration on the land was transferred 
to the name of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> way back in 
1937.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This lot No. 1563 of the <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span> cadastre, now in question, was among the lots that 
were the subject of registration in the cadastral proceedings of the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> (Cadastral Case No. 83, L. 
R. C. Record No. 1499); and in a decision rendered on July 16 1941, the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> adjudicated this lot to 
<span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>, subject to 
the lien that s mentioned in the decision, as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Later, on </span><st1:date month="12" day="7" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 7, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Decree of Registration No. N-14538 was issued by the Commissioner of Land 
Registration decreeing the registration of lot No. 1563 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>, subject to the 
lien that was dated in the decision, which <span class="GramE">We</span> have 
quoted in the preceding paragraph. <span class="GramE">Subsequently, or on 
</span></span><st1:date month="2" day="18" year="1955"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 18, 
1955</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, Original Certificate of Title 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> O-1738, 
covering said lot No. 1563, was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> and on the said 
original certificate of title the above-mentioned lien regarding the sale with 
right of repurchase in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> was 
mentioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Gaspara</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> 
had not repurchased the lot in question from Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, <span class="GramE">nor</span> from the successors 
in interest of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. <span class="GramE">The 
statement in Original Certificate of Title No.</span> O-1738 about the lien 
consisting of the sale with right of repurchase in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> remained <span class="SpellE">uncancelled</span>. On 
June 15<span class="GramE">,1960</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almiranez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, thru counsel, filed with the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> in the cadastral case, a motion 
praying that the ownership of lot No. 1563 be consolidated in their favor 
pursuant to the contract of sale with right of repurchase executed by <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> on August 10, 1931, 
and which was noted in Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738, said <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> not having re 
Purchased the land. It was further prayed that <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Devera</span> be ordered to deposit with the Clerk of Court t 
owner's copy of Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738; that the said original 
certificate of title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> <span class="GramE">be</span> ordered cancelled and the 
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> be authorized to issue a 
transfer certificate of title in the names of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Almirañez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Gaspara</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>, thru counsel, filed an opposition to the motion for 
consolidation of ownership in favor of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almirañez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. The grounds for the opposition boil down to one 
principal point, namely, that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, acting as a cadastral court, has no jurisdiction to 
order the consolidation of ownership in favor of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> and to order the cancellation of Original 
Certificate of Title No. O-1738 in the name of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> and replace it with a new transfer certificate of 
title in the name of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After hearing, on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="20" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 20, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> issued an order 
overruling the opposition to the motion for consolidation, and the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the order reads as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Unable to obtain <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> of the order of </span><st1:date month="12" day="20" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 20, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> appealed 
directly to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Counsel for the appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>, in this appeal 
contends: (1) that the cause of action involved ownership of Lot No. 1563 and is 
barred by the prior judgment of the cadastral court registering lot No. 1563 in 
the name of the appellant, and that said judgment operates as <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">res</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></span></em> 
against the motion for consolidation of ownership; (2) that the trial court in 
directing the cancellation Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738 and the 
issuance of another title in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
had in effect revoked the decree of registration of Lot No. 1563 in favor of 
appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>; 
(3) that the motion of June 15, 1960 for consolidation of ownership, based as it 
was on a deed of <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">pacto</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> de retro</span></em> sale with right to repurchase 
that was executed on August 10, 1931 was already barred by the statute of 
limitations and the motion constitutes a collateral attack upon the decree of 
registration of Lot No. 1563; (4) that the motion for consolidation is 
essentially a claim for recovery of land, and that the lower court exceeded its 
authority when it granted the said motion; and (5) that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have no legal capacity or personality to ask the 
lower court to order the consolidation of ownership over Lot No. 1563 in their 
favor and to ask for the issuance of a certificate of title in their 
names.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The counsel for the appellant 
made a lengthy discussion in his appeal brief of the alleged errors committed by 
the lower court, but it is noteworthy that he had evaded discussion on the point 
regarding the legal effect or implication of the statement in the decision of 
the cadastral court that the registration of Lot No. 1563 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> was subject to the 
lien consisting of the sale with right of repurchase in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, and the notation of said lien in the decree of 
registration and on Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">O-1738.</span> The principal issue in the present case, precisely, 
is: what effect must be given to that lien?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellant never questioned 
the propriety of the inclusion of a statement in the decision, in the decree of 
registration, and in the certificate of title, regarding the lien consisting of 
the sale with right of repurchase in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. It is presumed that when the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span>, acting as a cadastral court, its 
decision on July 16, 1941 adjudicating <span class="SpellE">iot</span> 1563 to 
<span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> with the 
statement that the registration of said lot was subject to the above-mentioned 
lien the contract of sale with right of repurchase that executed by <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> on August 10, 1931 
in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> was properly brought 
before the court. We do not agree with the contention of the appellant that the 
judgment in the cadastral proceedings constitutes a bar, or operates as <span class="SpellE"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">res</span></em></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></span></em>, 
against the motion for consolidation presented by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the present case, because precisely that sale 
with right of repurchase was duly recognized and embodied in the decision of the 
cadastral court. We hold that what the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had 
done, in filing the motion for consolidation on </span><st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
15, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
was not a collateral attack against the decree of registration, as claimed by 
the appellant. The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> simply asked the court to 
give effect to the lien which was clearly mentioned, in the decision, in the 
decree of registration, and in Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">O-1738.</span> When the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> granted said motion for consolidation and ordered the 
cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738, it did not thereby 
revoke the Decree of Registration No. N-14538, and reopen the registration case. 
The lower court simply made effective the very terms of the certificate of title 
which was issued pursuant to the decree of registration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The lien that We have adverted to 
refer to the contract of sale of Lot No. 1563 executed by <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> in favor of Julian 
<span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> for a consideration of P800.00 with right of 
repurchase <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">after</span></em> the 
expiration of two years. This contract was executed on </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
statement in the decision of the cadastral court, in the decree of registration 
<span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">N-14538, and in Original 
Certificate of Title No.</span> O-<span class="GramE">1738, that</span> the period 
of redemption was two years from the date of the execution of the contract must 
be corrected, because what the contract really recites is that the repurchase 
must be made after expiration of two years from the date of the execution of the 
contract (Exhibit A). This discrepancy, however, in no way affects the 
determination of the legal questions involved in the present 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contract of sale with right 
of repurchase was executed on </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, so 
that the law that governs this transaction <span class="GramE">are</span> the 
provisions of Article 1507, 1508, 1509 and 1518 of the Old Civil Code. Under the 
Old Civil Code, upon the execution of the contract of sale with right of 
repurchase the ownership over the property sold is transferred to the vendee 
subject only to the condition that the vendor exercises his right of repurchase 
within the period agreed upon. Under Article 1509, upon the failure of the 
vendor to repurchase the vendee irrevocably acquires ownership of the property 
sold that is, ownership is consolidated in the vendee by operation of law 
(Benito <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Luis <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, et al., 108 Phil., 1041).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, the contract of sale with right of repurchase was 
executed on </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, and 
it provides that the right of the vendor to repurchase would commence to run 
after the expiration of two years from the date of the execution of the 
contract. The period for repurchase, therefore, commenced to run on 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1933"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 11, 
1933</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Inasmuch as no definite period was stipulated within which the redemption would 
be made after the expiration of two years from the date of the execution of the 
instrument, the provisions of Article 1508 of the Old Civil Code governs; that 
is, the period for repurchase should be within four years from the expiration of 
two years (Rosales <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Reyes 
and <span class="SpellE">Ordoveza</span>, 25 Phil. 495). The period for 
redemption, therefore, had expired on </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1937"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1937</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. By 
operation of law, upon failure of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> to re-purchase Lot No. 1563 from Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> on </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1937"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1937</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
ownership of the lot became consolidated in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, and the latter had irrevocably acquired ownership 
of the property. Even if the period for repurchase is fixed at ten years from 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
legal situation is not changed because <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> had never repurchased the land in question. <span class="GramE">The evidence that in 1937 the tax declaration covering the lot in 
question was transferred to the name of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence also shows that 
Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> was in possession of the land in 
question from the time he bought the same on </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> up 
to the time when he died during the Japanese occupation. After the death of 
Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> his son Primitive <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> inherited the land and took possession of the same 
until he died. Upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> inherited the property and took possession 
of the same. On </span><st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 10, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
<span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> sold the

possession of the same. The evidence further shows that while the decision in 
the cadastral proceedings was rendered on </span><st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1941"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">July 16, 
1941</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
decree of registration was issued by the Land Registration Commissioner only on 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="7" year="1954"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 7, 
1954</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> was issued on 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="18" year="1955"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 18, 
1955</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It 
was on </span><st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 15, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, or 
barely five years after the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No. 
O-1738, when <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almiranez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> filed a motion in the lower court to consolidate 
their ownership of the land in question, as the successors in interest of the 
original vendee, Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. The rights of 
Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> as vendee had been transmitted to his 
son <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> by 
operation of law; likewise the right of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> was transmitted upon his death to his 
daughter, <span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> by 
operation of law; and it was this right which she inherited from her father that 
<span class="SpellE">Nimfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> had sold to 
the spouses <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almiranez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>. The contention of the appellant, therefore, that 
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have no legal capacity or personality to 
file the motion of June 15, 1960 before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> has no merit (Government <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Serafica</span>, 
61 Phil. 93). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The undisputed fact is that <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> had not purchased 
lot No. 1563 from Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> <span class="GramE">nor</span> from any of the successors in interest of Julian <span class="SpellE">Viliabona</span>. There is no evidence that any extension of time 
had been given to <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> for the repurchase of the land in question. It is 
clear, therefore, that by her own act of selling the land in question to Julian 
<span class="SpellE">Viliabona</span> under a contract of sale with right of 
repurchase, and by her failure to repurchase the property pursuant to the terms 
of that contract of sale, <span class="SpellE">C.aspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> had divested "herself of whatever right or title she 
had over lot No. 1563 covered by Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">O-1738 in her name.</span> The fact that the property was registered 
in her name did not preclude the recognition of the better right over the 
property in favor of another person, or in favor of the successors in interest 
of said person. (<span class="SpellE">Cabanos</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Register of Deeds of Laguna et al., 
40 Phil. 620). This is more so in the present case because the right of the 
other person is precisely recognized in the very same certificate of title that 
is in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the Court of First Instance 
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> declared the ownership of lot No. 1563 
consolidated in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and ordered the 
cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738 in the name of the 
appellant and its replacement with a transfer certificate of title in the name 
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> said court acted properly in accordance 
with provisions of Section 112 of Act 496. Said section Provides as follows: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are certainly 
persons in interest who had come to court at <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">any time</span></em> to petition upon the ground 
that the interest of the appellant as registered owner, appearing in Original 
Certificate of Title No. O-1738, had terminated and ceased, and that they (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) have an interest that had been created which do 
not appear in the certificate, and they thereby prayed the court to grant them 
relief as it may deem proper. In other words, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almiranez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, on June 15, 1960, had petitioned the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, as a cadastral court, in the 
cadastral case involving Lot No. 1563, and showed to the court that registered 
interest of the appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> as owner of Lot No. 1563 had terminated and ceased 
because said land had been sold by <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> to Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> way 
back in 1931 under a contract of sale with right of repurchase and that <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> had not repurchased 
the land in accordance with the contract of sale, so that the ownership of the 
land had been consolidated in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> and/or his successors in interest, and, therefore, 
<span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> was no longer 
<span class="SpellE">longer</span> the owner of the lot, and because of that the 
Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> should be cancelled 
and a new transfer certificate of title should be issued in their (<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>') names. The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> acting as a registration court took cognizance of the 
motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the cadastral case, and, 
after due notice to the appellants, the motion was heard. The court found that 
indeed <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> had 
sold Lot No. 1563 of the <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span> cadastre to Julian 
<span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> on August 10, 1931 under a contract of sale 
with right of repurchase and that she had not repurchase the land as provided in 
the contract of sale. The court likewise found that Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> and his successors in interest had been in 
possession of the land since </span><st1:date month="8" day="10" year="1931"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">August 10, 
1931</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
had been paying the taxes on the land. In view of these findings of the court, 
and considering that the sale with right of repurchase in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> was recorded on the Original Certificate of Title 
No. O-1738, the court declared that the ownership of Lot No. 1563 was 
consolidated in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almirañez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, and ordered that 
Original Certificate of Title No. O-1738 <span class="GramE">be</span> surrendered 
by the appellant <span class="SpellE">Gaspara</span> <span class="SpellE">Devera</span> and that said original certificate of title be 
replaced by a new transfer certificate of title in the names of said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>. Certainly the facts and circumstances as found by 
the lower court also constitute a "reasonable ground" for the action taken by 
said court, as contemplated in the provisions of Section 112 of Act 496 (Jose A. 
<span class="SpellE">Caoibes</span> et al. vs. Maria C. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> de Martinez, et al., 54 Off. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 
366).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Counsel for the appellant 
contends that Section 112 of Act 496 would not apply in the present case because 
relief under said section "can only be granted if there is unanimity among the 
parties, or there is no adverse claim or serious Ejections on the part of any 
party in interest. . ." This contention has no application in the present case. 
In the case of <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> Enriquez et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> E. de <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> et al., 100 
Phil. 1072; this Court, referring to the phrase "unanimity among the parties"

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court in the same <span class="GramE">case,</span> further held: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

waived by agreement of the parties. Such jurisdiction is determined by law and 
cannot be acquired by the court by consent or submission of the parties * * 
*"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, the title, or right of ownership of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Almiranez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isidra</span> <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>, over Lot No. 1563 can not be seriously <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>. The existence of the contract of sale with 
right of repurchase executed by the appellant in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> (predecessor in interest of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>) has not been denied by the appellant. The 
appellant had not questioned the notation in the decision of the cadastral 
court, in the decree of registration, and in Original Certificate of Title No. 
<span class="GramE">O-1738, of the lien consisting of the sale with right of 
repurchase in favor of the original vendee Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span>.</span> As <span class="GramE">We</span> have 
adverted to, the appellant had evaded discussion in his brief about the legal 
effect of the notation of that lien in the decision, in the decree of 
registration and in the original certificate of title issued to her. The 
appellant filed an opposition to the motion of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the court below, but the appellant did not 
present any evidence in support of her opposition. The appellant had not 
disproved the evidence of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that she 
(appellant) had not repurchased Lot No. 1563 from Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> or from the successors in interest of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> and that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
and their successors in interest had been in possession of said lot. We have 
pointed out that by operation of law the ownership of Lot No. 1563 was 
consolidated in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> by the 
failure of the appellant to repurchase the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The title of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> who are seeking relief under Section 112 of Act 
496, therefore, is not seriously <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>. What 
the appellant is <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> in the present case is 
the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> to grant the relief that was prayed for by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>. But, as ruled by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> Enriquez et al <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> 
E. de <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra</span></em> the jurisdiction of the Court can 
not be the subject of agreement or waiver of the parties. Under the facts and 
circumstances of the present case We hold that there is no serious controversy 
between the parties as to the title of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
over Lot 1563 so that the requirement of "unanimity among the parties", as 
defined by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Felipa</span> Enriquez 
et al <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> E. de <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">supra</span></em>, has been satisfied. We also hold 
that the lower court has jurisdiction to take cognizance of the motion for 
consolidation and for the cancellation of the original certificate of title in 
the name of the appellant and for the replacement of said original certificate 
of title with a transfer certificate of title in the name of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and to grant the relief prayed for, because what 
was asked of the lower court was to give effect to what appears on the 
certificate of title, and We believe that this is perfectly within the 
jurisdiction of the court to do under Section 112 of Act 
496.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We hold that the proceedings 
contemplated in Section 112 of Act 496 are intended to grant relief to parties 
whose title to the property that is covered by a certificate of title is clearly 
established, as in the case of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the 
present case. It is not enough that the petition of a party for relief under 
said Section 112 is opposed for one reason or another. The opposition must be 
serious enough as to place in grave doubt the title over the registered property 
of the person who seeks relief under that section. Otherwise, the efficacy of 
the remedy contemplated in this Section 112 would be frustrated by the filing of 
any protest or claim, more or less baseless, which is intended merely to harass 
or prejudice the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>. What should matter <span class="GramE">is</span> not the allegations in the opposition to the motion filed 
in court under Section 112 but the real nature of the title of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> over the registered property as found by the court 
after hearing, of which the parties had been duly 
notified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court has ruled that in 
proceedings under Section 112 of Act 496 the Court of First Instance, acting as 
a registration court, may hear evidence and decide controversial matters with a 
view to determining whether the person seeking relief under this section is 
entitled to the relief or not. Thus in the case of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> H. Luna, et al. vs. Pedro P. Santos, et al., 102 
Phil. 588, this Court held: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In trying to assail the

ones who raised the legality of the transfers of the certificates on the basis 
of paid instrument (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) and even if said question 
had to be resolved by the lower court as a Land Registration Court, under the

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case now at bar, what the 
lower court did was not to decide on any question affecting the ownership of Lot 
No. 1563 that was covered by Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">O-1738.</span> We said that the ownership of lot No. 1563 had been 
consolidated in favor of Julian <span class="SpellE">Villabona</span> pursuant to 
the contract of sale with right of repurchase that was recorded in said original 
certificate of title, by operation of law. What the lower count did was simply 
to give effect to the lien that was recorded in the certificate of title which, 
by operation of law, had vested title on the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The contention of the appellant,
