				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal certified to this Court by the Court of Appeals as
involving purely legal issues, we hold that a special power of attorney to mort­gage
real estate is limited to such authority to mortgage and does not bind the
grantor personal­ly to other obligations contracted by the grantee, in the
absence of any ratification or other simi­lar act that would estop the grantor
from ques­tioning or disowning such other obligations con­tracted by the
grantee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff bank filed this action on February 10, 1961 against
defendant Maximo Sta. Maria and his six brothers and sisters,
defendants-appellants, Valeriana, Emeteria, Teofilo, Quintin, Rosario and
Leonila, all surnamed Sta. Maria, and the Associa­ted Insurance &amp; Surety
Co., Inc. as surety, for the collection of certain amounts representing unpaid
balances on two agricultural sugar crop loans due allegedly from defendants.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The said sugar crop loans were obtained by defendant Maximo Sta.
Maria from plaintiff bank under a special power of attorney, executed in his
favor by his six brothers and sisters, defendants-appellants herein, <u>to
mortgage</u> a 16-odd hectare parcel of land, jointly owned by all of them, the
pertinent portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That we, VALERIANA, EMETERIA, TEOFILO, QUINTIN, ROSARIO and
LEONILA all surnamed STA. MARIA, sole heirs of our deceased parents CANDIDO
STA. MARIA and FRANCISCA DE LOS REYES, all of legal age, Filipinos, and
residents of Dinalupihan, Ba­taan, do hereby name, constitute and appoint Dr.
MAXIMO STA. MARIA, of legal age, married, and residing at Dinalupihan, Bataan
to be our true and lawful attorney of and in our place, name and stead <u>to
mortgage, or convey as security to any bank, company or to any natural or
juridical person, our undivided shares over a certain parcel of land together
with the improvements thereon</u> which parcel of land is more particularly des­cribed
as follows to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Situated in the barrio of Pinulot, municipa­lity of <span style="">Dinalupihan, </span>Bataan, containing an
area of 16,7249 hectares and bounded as follows to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>North by property of Alejandro Benito; on the
Northeast, by public land and <span style="">property </span>of
Tomas Tulop on the southeast, by property of Ramindo Agustin; on the southwest,
by proper­ties of Jose V. Reyes and Emilio Reyes; and on the northwest, by
excluded portion claimed by Emilio Reyes.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">of which parcel of land aforementioned we
are together with our said attorney who is our brother, the owners in equal
undivided shares as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2785 of the
Registry of Deeds of Bataan dated Feb. 26th 1951." (Exh. E)<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, Valeriana Sta. Maria alone also executed in favor of
her brother, Maximo, a special power of attorney <u>to borrow money and
mortgage</u> any real estate owned by her, grant­ing him the following
authority:</p>

<blockquote>"For me and in my name <u>to borrow money</u> and make,
execute, sign and deliver mortgages of real estate now owned by me standing in
my<span style=""> </span>name and <u>to make</u>, <u>exe</u>­<u>cute,
sign and deliver any and all promissory notes necessary</u> in the
premises." (EXH. E-1)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the two above powers, Maximo Sta. Maria applied for
two separate crop loans, for the 1952-1953 and 1953-1954 crop years, with
plaintiff bank, one in the amount of P15,000.00, of which only the sum of
P13,216.11 was actually extended by plaintiff, and the other in the amount of
P23,000.00, of which only the sum of P12,427.57 was actually extended by
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As security for the two
loans, Maximo Sta. Maria executed <u>in his own name</u> in favor of plaintiff
bank two chattel mortgages on the standing crops, gua­ranteed by surety bonds
for the full authorized amounts of the loans executed by the Associated
Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. as surety with Maximo Sta. Maria as
principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the crop loan
application further disclose that among the securities given by Max­imo for the
loans were a "2nd mortgage on 25,3023 Has. of sugar-land, including sugar
quota rights therein" including the parcel of land jointly owned by Maximo
and his six brothers and sisters herein for the 1952-1953 crop loan, with the
notation that the bank already held a first mortgage on the same properties for
the 1951-1952 crop loan of Maximo,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and a 3rd mortgage on the same properties for the 1953-1954 crop loan.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff and
against defendants thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
condemning the defendant Maximo R. Sta. Maria and his co-defendants Valeriana,
Quintin, Rosario, Emeteria, Teofilo, and Leonila all surnamed Sta. Maria and the
Associated Insurance and Surety Com­pany, Inc., jointly and severally, to pay
the plaintiff, the Philippine National Bank, Del Carmen Branch, as fol­lows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first cause of action, the sum of
P8,500.72 with a daily interest of<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P0.83
on P6,100.00 at 6% per annum beginning August 21, 1963 until fully paid;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the second cause of action, the <span style="">sum </span>of P14,299.79 with a daily
interest of P1.53 on P9,346.44 at 6% per annum, until fully paid; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On both causes of action the further sum equi­valent
to 10% of the total amount due as attorney's fee as of the date of the
execution of this decision, and the costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Maximo Sta. Maria and his surety, defendant Associate
Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. who did not resist the action, did not appeal the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal has been taken by
his six brothers and sisters, defendants-appellants who reiterate in their
brief their main contention in their Answer to the complaint that under the
special power of attorney, Exh. E, they had not given their brother, Maximo,
the authority to borrow money but only to mort­gage the real estate jointly
owned by them; and that if they are liable at all, their liability should not
go beyond the value of the property which they had authorized to be given as
security for the loans ob­tained by Maximo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their answer, defendants-appellants had fur­ther contended that they
did not benefit whatsoever from the loans, and that the plaintiff bank's only
recourse against them is to fore­close on the property which they had
authorized Maximo to mort­gage.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal of defendants appellants, except for defen­dant
Valeriana Sta. Maria who had executed another special power of attorney, Exh.
E-1, expressly authorizing Maximo to borrow money on her behalf, to be well taken.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff bank has not
made out a cause of action against defendants-appellants (except Valeriana), so
as to hold them liable for the unpaid balances of the loans obtained by Maximo
under the chattel mortgages executed by him in his own name alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the early case of <u>Bank of P.I. vs. de
Coster</u>, this Court, in holding that the broad power of attorney given by
the wife to the husband to look after and protect the wife's interests and to
transact her business did not authorize him to make her liable as a surety for
the payment of the pre-existing debt of a third person, cited the fundamental
construction rule that "where in an instrument powers and duties are
specified and defined, that all of such powers and duties are limited and
confined to those which are specified and defined, and that all other powers
and duties are excluded."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This is but in accord with the disinclination of courts to enlarge <span style="">an </span>authority granted beyond the powers
expressly given and those which incidentally flow or derive therefrom as being
usual or reasonably necessary and proper for the performance of such ex­press
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even before the filing of the
present, action this Court in the similar case of <u>De Villa vs. Fabricante</u><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
had already ruled that where the power of attorney given to the husband by the
wife was limited to a grant of authority to mortgage a parcel of land titled in
the wife's name, the wife may not be held liable for the pay­ment of the
mortgage debt contracted by the husband, as the author­ity to mortgage does not
carry with it the authority to contract obli­gation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court thus held in the said case:</p>

<blockquote>“Appellant claims that the trial court erred in hold­ing that only
Cesario A. Fabricante is liable to pay the mortgage debt and not his wife who
is exempt from liabili­ty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<u>Only the defendant
Cesario A. Fabricante is liable for the payment of this amount because it does
not appear that the other defendant Maria G. de Fabricante had authorized
Cesario A. Fabricante to contract the debt also in her name</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of attorney was not presented and
it is to be presumed that the power (of attorney) was limited to a grant of
authority to Cesario A. Fabricante to mortgage the parcel of land covered by
Trans­fer Certificate of Title in the name of Maria G. de Febri­cante.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We went over the contents of the deed of mortgage executed by
Cesario Fabricante in favor of Appellant on April 18, 1944, and <u>there is
really nothing therein from which we may infer that Cesario was authorized by
his wife to contract the obligation in her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed shows that the authority was limited
to the execution of the mortgage inso­far as the property of the wife is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a difference between
authority </u><u><span style="">to mortgage and
authority to </span>contract obligation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the power of attorney was not pre­sented as evidence, the trial
court was correct in presuming that that power was merely <u>limited to a grant
of authority to mortgage unless the contrary is shown</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authority granted by
defendants-appellants (except Valeriana) unto their brother, Maximo, was merely
to mortgage the property jointly owned by them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They did not grant Maximo any authority to contract for any loans in
their names and behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maximo alone,
with Valeriana who authorized him to borrow money, must answer for said loans
and the other defendants-appellants' only liability is that the real estate
authorized by them to be mortgaged would be subject to foreclosure and sale to
respond for the obligations contracted by Maximo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they cannot be held personally liable for
the payment of such obligations, as erroneusly held by the trial court.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Maximo
presented to the plaintiff bank Valeriana's additional special power of
attorney expressly author­izing him to borrow money, Exh. E-1, aside from the
authority to mortgage executed by Valeriana together with the other defen­dants-appellants
also in Maximo's favor, lends support to our view that the bank was not
satisfied with the authority to mortgage alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For otherwise, such authority to borrow would have been deemed
unnecessary and a surplusage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And having
failed to require that Maximo submit a similar authority to borrow, from the
other def­endants-appellants, plaintiff, which apparently was satisfied with
the surety bond for repayment put up by Maximo, cannot now seek to hold said
defendants-appellants similarly liable for the unpaid loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's argument that "a mortgage is
simply an accessory contract, and that to effect the mortgage, a loan has to be
secured"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
falls far short of the mark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maximo had
indeed secured the loan on his own account, and the defendants-appellants had
authorized him to mortgage their respective undivided shares of the real
property jointly owned by them as security for the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that was the extent of their authority
and consequent liability, to have the real property answer for the loan in case
of non-payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not unusual in
family and business circles that one would allow his property or an undivided
share in real estate to be mortgaged by another as security, either as an
accommodation or for valua­ble consideration, but the grant of such authority
does not extend to assuming personal liability, much less solidary liability,
for any loan secured by the grantee in the absence of express authority so
given by the grantor.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The outcome might be
different if there had been an ex­press ratification of the loans by
defendants-appellants or if it had been shown that they had been benefited by
the crop loans so as to put them in estoppel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the burden of establishing such ratifica­tion or estoppel falls
squarely upon plaintiff bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not
only failed to discharge this burden, but the record stands undisputed that
defendant-appellant Quintin Sta. Maria testified that he and his co-defendants
executed the authority to mortgage "to accommo­date (my) brother Dr.
Maximo Sta. Maria .. and because he is my brother, I signed it to accommodate
him as security for whatever he may apply as loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only for that land, we gave him as secu­rity"
and that "we brothers did not receive any centavo as bene­fit."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The record further shows plaintiff bank itself admitted during the trial that
defendants-appellants "did not profit from the loan" and that they
"did not receive any money (the loan proceeds) from (Maximo)"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
No estoppel therefore can be claimed by plaintiff as against
defendants-appellants.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, as to the extent of
defendant Valeriana Sta. Maria's liability to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated above, Valeriana stands lia­ble
not merely on the mortgage of her share in the property, but also for the loans
which Maximo had obtained from plaintiff bank, since she had expressly granted
Maximo the authority to incur such loans.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Exh. E-1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the question
has not been raised in appellants' brief, we hold that Valeriana's liability
for the loans secured by Maximo is not <u>joint and several</u> or <u>solidary</u>
as adjudged by the trial court, but only <u>joint</u>, pursuant to the
provisions of Ar­ticle 1207 of the Civil Code that "(T)he concurrence . .
. of two or more debtors in one and the same obligation does not imply that . .
each one of the (debtors) is bound to render entire compliance with the
prestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a solidary
liability only when the obliga­tion expressly so states, or when the law or the
nature of the obli­gation requires solidarity." It should be noted that in
the addition­al special power of attorney, Exh. E-1, executed by Valeriana, she
did not grant Maximo the authority to bind her solidarily with him on any loans
he might secure thereunder.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, as to the 10%
award of attorney's fees, this Court believes that considering the resources of
plaintiff bank and the fact that the principal debtor, Maximo Sta. Maria, had not
con­tested the suit, an award of five (5%) per cent of the balance due on the
principal, exclusive of interests, i.e. a balance of P6,100.00 on the first
cause of action and a balance of P9,346.44 on the second cause of action, per
the bank's statements of August 20, 1963, (Exhs. Q-1 and BB-1, respectively)
should be sufficient.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court against
defendants-appellants EMETERIA, TEOFILO, QUINTIN, ROSARIO and LEONILA, all
surnamed STA. MARIA is hereby reversed and set aside, with costs in both
instances against plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judgment against defendant-appellant VALERIANA STA. MARIA is modified in that
her liability is held to be joint and not solidary, and the award of attorney's
fees is reduced as set forth in the pre­ceding paragraph, without costs in this
instance.</p>
