<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Republic Act No. <span class="GramE">4413,</span> entitled "An Act creating the City of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Rajah <span class="SpellE">Buayan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">" and constituting the charter 
thereof, was approved by the Congress of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on </span><st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 
17, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Under section 2 of the Act the city thus created "shall comprise the present 
territorial jurisdiction of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">General

The other sections set up the 
structure of the city government, its departments and offices, their respective 
powers and functions, and other matters pertaining to administration. The seed 
of the present discord is contained in the last provision - Section 92 - which 
states: "This Act shall take effect on </span><st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, if 
a majority of the qualified voters of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">General

1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
under the supervision of the Commission on Elections."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><st1:date month="11" day="9" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 9, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, was 
also the date of the national election for the offices of President, 
Vice-President, eight Senators, and members of the House of Representatives. The 
plebiscite provided for in Republic Act 4413 was held jointly with the national 
election in the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">General 
Santos</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, where only one ballot for each 
voter was used although with different spaces indicated for the two purposes. 
The canvass of the results gave the following figures:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Number of registered voters - 
15,727<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Number of registered voters who 
actually voted (in the election) - 9,192<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Number of registered voters who 
voted for or against the conversion of the municipality into a city - 
7,488<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Number of registered voters who 
voted in favor of conversion - 4,422<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Number of registered voters who 
voted against conversion - 3,066<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the basis of the foregoing 
results the Commission on Elections, on </span><st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 6, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
finding that "the affirmative votes represent the majority of the votes cast in 
said plebiscite," proclaimed the creation of the new chartered city effective 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. On 
December 11, 1965 petitioners, alleging that they were residents and property 
owners in General Santos, that they voted against the conversion of the 
municipality into a city and that they would be affected adversely by said 
conversion, filed a petition in the Commission on Elections challenging the 
validity of the proclamation and asking for its reconsideration and reversal. 
The petition was denied on </span><st1:date month="12" day="16" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 16, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
petitioners seasonably interposed the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On January 4, 1966 we issued a 
writ of preliminary injunction restraining respondent municipal officers of 
General Santos (a) from spending municipal funds and devoting official hours in 
the preparation for the inauguration of the City of Rajah <span class="SpellE">Buayan</span>; (b) from inaugurating the said City on January 1, 
1966 (or any subsequent date, as per resolution of this Court dated January 5); 
and (c) from performing any act or acts authorized by or pursuant to the 
provisions of Republic Act No. 4413.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This case turns on the meaning of 
the phrase "majority of the qualified voters" used in Section 92 of said Act. 
The basis for the computation of such majority adopted by the Commission on 
Elections both in its proclamation of </span><st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1965"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 6, 
1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
in its answer to the instant petition is the number of voters who actually voted 
in the plebiscite for or against the conversion. Under this theory those who 
were registered voters but stayed away from the election as well as those who 
voted in the election but left their ballots blank insofar as the plebiscite was 
concerned were not qualified voters for purposes of the legal provision in 
question. Without resorting to sophisticated <span class="SpellE">retiocinations</span> and using only the common, down-to-earth 
understanding of the layman, short shrift must be made of the view thus 
advanced. For to accept it would mean that a voter is qualified only if and when 
he actually votes on a given question, and convert the number of qualified 
voters in a locality into an amorphous and variable factor - changing as often 
as there are questions voted upon and according to the whims of the individual 
voter, or to circumstances that are entirely fortuitous, such as the state of 
his digestion on election day. Thus the registered voters of the municipality of 
General Santos - 15,727 in all - would not be considered qualified on the basis 
merely of their registration; and the number of qualified voters of the said 
municipality on November 9, 1965 would be either 9,192 or 7,488, depending upon 
the particular matter voted on. Indeed the number could very well have been 
more, or very much less. If three had voted in the plebiscite - two in favor of 
conversion and one against it - the two would have carried the day, since there 
were only three qualified voters, to follow respondents' argument to its logical 
conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The foregoing, of course, is just 
by way of showing how the rational mind, uncluttered by masses of seemingly 
conflicting authorities and taking the common sense of the situation, would 
react to issue presented. For both parties here are not wanting in citations 
from court decisions in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to support their respective 
positions. But confronted with a choice between them, we feel no hesitation in 
adopting the view supported by petitioners' citations, because it is more in 
consonance not only with our existing laws but also with demonstrable 
legislative intent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Revised Election Code (R.A. 
No. 180, as amended) provides in section 2 that "all elections of public 
officers by the people and <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">all <span class="SpellE">votings</span> in connection</span></em> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">with plebiscites</span></em> shall be conducted in 
conformity with the provisions of this Code." Then in section 96 it says: "In 
order that a qualified elector may vote in any regular or special election, he 
must be registered in the permanent list of voters for the municipality in which 
he resides;" and in section 176(f): "In election contest proceedings, the 
registry list, as finally corrected by the board of inspectors, shall be 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">conclusive in regard to the question as 
to who had the right to vote in said 
election."</span></em><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">These related provisions of the 
Revised Election Code dispose of the argument advanced by respondents that the 
registry list of voters is not a safe gauge for determining the number of 
qualified voters. It is in fact the only safe and reliable gauge, especially 
considering that it is periodically updated and that corrections therein are 
authorized thru court petitions for inclusion or exclusion of voters shortly 
before elections (Sections 105, Rev. Election Code) as well as thru challenges 
to any person offering to vote during election day (Section 138, id.). If, 
according to the law, any person not listed in the registry is not entitled to 
vote and, conversely, every person so listed is entitled to vote except when 
judicially excluded or successfully challenged, there can be no doubt that the 
term "qualified voters" is equivalent to "registered voters." Any other approach 
to the problem would be confusing and impractical. It would be indeed idle and 
illogical to say that a person is a qualified voter but cannot vote because he 
is not registered, or that a registered voter is not qualified because he does 
not actually vote. Certainly his qualification as a voter does not disappear 
just because he fails to vote, either through happenstance or by choice. 
Otherwise a person may be a qualified voter and not a qualified voter at the 
same time - an obviously unacceptable situation - as in the cases of those 
voters in the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">General 
Santos</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (1,704 of them) who voted for 
candidates in the elections but abstained from voting in the 
plebiscite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The language of Section 92 of 
Republic Act No. 4413 is clear and unequivocal. When the Congress used the 
phrase "majority of qualified voters" it could not have meant "majority of the 
votes cast." The two phrases are as different as the words employed, and it 
stands to reason that the Congress did not intend the first to be taken in the 
same sense the latter is understood. If it had in mind a mere "majority of the 
votes cast" it would have said so, just as it did in Republic Act No. 4584, 
creating the City of <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, passed the same year 
Republic Act No. 4413 was enacted. Thus Section 90 of Republic Act No. 4584 
reads: "this Act shall take effect on January one, nineteen hundred and 
sixty-six, if a majority of votes are cast in favor of the conversion of the 
municipality into a city over those cast against the conversion through a 
plebiscite which shall be held simultaneously with the national elections of 
nineteen hundred and sixty-five." The difference in phraseology can only be 
explained by a difference in legislative intent, not by some capricious exercise 
in semantics on the part of those who drafted both 
enactments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Two or three court decisions from 
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> may be cited, not as doctrinal 
for purposes of the present case but as demonstrative of the ratio <span class="SpellE">decidendi</span> which we find both cogent and 
persuasive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In one decision by the Supreme 
Court of <span class="GramE">Missouri<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[</span></sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1]</span></sup></span> the proposition submitted to 
the electorate required for its passage "a majority of the qualified voters and 
taxpayers of any school district." The court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">". . <span class="GramE">.a</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"it was not Intended by the 
Legislature that, if there were only 3 present out of 40 voters and taxpayers, 
the majority of those present at such meeting could fix this burden upon the

plainly expressed by saying that the result should be determined by a majority 
of those present and voting at such meeting. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The rule of construction . . . 
is this: That, when by law, a vote is required or permitted to be taken, and a

voters entitled to vote at such election, and not a mere majority of those 
voting thereat. . ."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In another case, decided by the 
Supreme Court of Wyoming<span class="GramE">,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[</span></sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2]</span></sup></span> the question presented 
involved an amendment to the constitution, which required "a majority of the 
electors" for ratification. There were 37,561 votes cast at that election, and 
of these 12, 160 voted in favor of the amendment while 1,363 voted against its 
adoption, Said the Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“. . . Such proposed amendment 
can only be ratified by a majority of the electors. It would be anomalous to 
say, in view of this section taken as a <span class="GramE">whole, that</span> it 
was intended to mean only those who actually voted upon the amendment, or in 
other words, a majority of some of the electors, excluding others. . 
.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"... <span class="GramE">when</span> the Constitution says a majority of the electors, it 
means, In the absence of any qualifying phrase, a majority of those entitled to 
vote. . . The language is broader in meaning than a mere majority of the 
electors who actually vote upon the 
proposition."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The same decision of the Wyoming 
Court gives the answer to the argument, similar to that advanced here by 
respondents, that the voters who refrained from voting on the question submitted 
to them must be deemed to have acquiesced to the will of the majority of those 
who actually voted. The court said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">". . . It was the expression of 
the elector's wish upon the question which the law called for - a positive 
expression in a particular manner -and not the absence of such expression which 
was authorized to be recorded. To ratify is to affirm, and the Constitution 
requires in order <span class="GramE">to ratify</span> that there be an 
affirmative expression of a majority of the electors to whom the question Is 
submitted, the withholding of which is not sufficient. . . 
"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Republic Act No. 4413 provides 
that it "shall take effect on </span><st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1966"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 1, 
1966</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, if

1965</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">." In 
the language of the Supreme Court of Missouri<span class="GramE">,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[</span></sup></span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3]</span></sup></span> interpreting a similar

required is specifically named, and there is no difficulty in ascertaining what 
that number is, since the same constitution provides for a registration and 
points out who the qualified voters are."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In those jurisdictions in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> where it has been held that a 
majority of qualified voters means majority of the votes polled, we note that 
the reason for the ruling is the impracticability of determining the number of 
qualified voters except on the basis of the votes actually cast. Evidently this 
situation does not obtain here, in view of Section 96 of our Revised Election 
Code which requires a voter to be registered in a permanent list of voters in 
order to be qualified to vote, and of Section 176(f) which makes such registry 
list conclusive in regard to the question as to who had the right to vote in a 
given election. "It would be absurd," according to the Supreme Court of 
Georgia,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[4]</span></sup></span>"to hold that the qualified 
voters of a municipality should register in order that it might be ascertained 
who are qualified to vote, and then hold that this registration has no effect in 
determining the number of qualified voters in the 
municipality."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The foregoing considerations 
leave us no choice but to declare that the phrase "majority of the qualified 
voters" means "majority of the registered voters;" and that consequently the 
charter of the City of Rajah <span class="SpellE">Buayan</span> was not duly 
accepted by such majority of the qualified voters of the municipality of General 
Santos in the elections of November 9, 1965, as provided in Republic Act No. 
4413.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore the writ prayed for is 
granted; the proclamation of respondent Commission on Elections dated December 
6, 1965 and its resolution dated December 16, 1965, denying the petition of 
herein petitioners, are hereby annulled and set aside; and the preliminary 
injunction Issued by this Court on January 4, 1966, as clarified by its 
resolution of January 5, 1966, Is made permanent. No pronouncement as to
