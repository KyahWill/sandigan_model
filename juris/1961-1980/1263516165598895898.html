				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The Commissioner of Customs
seeks the review by certiorari of a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals
ordering him to refund to <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (Philippines) Inc.
the sum of P33,766.00, without pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no dispute as to
the facts, the same having been stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the period from January to September 1959, 32 shipments of
assorted goods, consigned to <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>, arrive at the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Port</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Collector of Customs thereof assessed and collected the special import tax
prescribed in Republic Act No. 1394, at the rate of 17%, amounting to
P75,730.00, on the goods imported from January to June 1959, and at the rate of
15.3%, in the total sum of P49,408.00, on the other shipments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the aggregate sum paid by <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> amounted to P125,138.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In due time, it filed
separate protests upon the ground that the rate fixed in Section 1 of Republic
Act 1394, for the year 1959, was 11.9%.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="4"><span style="">April 22, </span>1960</st1:date>, the
Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> rendered his decision on
said protests holding that the rate of special import tax applicable, pursuant
to Proclamation No. 601 of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
dated <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1959</st1:date> is
15.3%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision having been
affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs, <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, with the result already adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for review on
certiorari, filed by said Commissioner, which has been given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point in issue is the rate of the special import tax
collectible on the importations under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that, if the rate
applicable is 11.9%, the total amount of taxes due would be P91,322.00 and <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> would be entitled to reimbursement in the sum of
P33,766.00, whereas, if the proper rate were 15.3%, the special import tax due
would aggregate P117,567.00, so that the amount refundable would be P7,571.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent law is admittedly Republic Act 1394, approved on <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 thereof prescribes a diminishing
rate of special import tax on goods, articles or products imported or brought
into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
ranging from 17% for 1956 to 1.7% for 1965.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rate fixed for calendar year 1959 is 11.9%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Section 2 of said Act provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a)
Notwithstanding the provisions of section one of this Act, if as a result of
the application of the schedule therein, the total revenue derived from the
customs duties and from the special import tax on goods, articles or products
imported from the United States is less <u>in any calendar</u> year than the
proceeds from the exchange tax imposed under Republic Act Num­bered Six hundred
and one, as amended, on such goods, articles or products during the calendar
year 1955, <u>the President may, by proclamation, suspend the reduction of the
special import tax for the next succeeding calendar year</u> as prescribed in
the schedule, and, <u>in order to restore the total revenue to be collected on
the importation of United States goods, articles or products to the level of
the exchange tax thereon during the calendar year 1955, increase the special
import tax on all goods coming from any country for such succeeding calendar
year to any previous rate provided for in this Act which is deemed necessary to
restore the said revenue to the level attain in the calendar year 1955</u>.”
(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) After the President shall have made adjustments in the
rate of tax for any given year in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
section, the tax to be imposed in subsequent years shall be as pro<span style="">vided for the corresponding year in the
schedule in section one: </span><u><span style="">Provided</span></u><span style="">, That </span><span style="">the President may impose any higher rate of tax within the schedule
other than that fixed for the corresponding year in order to cover anticipated
deficiency in revenue arising from the operation of this Act."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to the authority
vested in him by this section on July 14, 1959, the President issued
Proclamation No. 601 suspending "during the calendar year 1959, starting
from January 1st," the rate of 11.9% prescribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
in Section 1 of Republic Act 1394, and increasing the special import tax for
said year to 15.3% - which is the rate prescribed in sec. 1 of Rep. Act 1394
for the year 1957 - upon the ground that such measure was "considered
necessary to restore </span><u><span style="">in the </span></u><u><span style="">calendar year 1959</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></span><span style=""> the total revenue to be collected on the
importation of x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> goods </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">to the level of the exchange tax collected </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">during the
calendar year 1955," which was P68,929,140.00, inasmuch as the total
revenue from import duties and special import tax from January 1 to De­cember
31, 1958, "amounted to only P62,684,354.60," </span>or <span style="">"below the level attained in the
calendar year 1955."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Despite the explicit
language of said proclamation, making the increase effective "during the
calendar year 1959, starting from January 1," the Tax Court </span>ruled
the <span style="">same inapplicable to the
importations in question for the reason that the same were made prior to the
publication of said proclamation in the issue of the Official Gazette dated
July 27, 1959, which was actually released to the public on September 22, 1959,
and said Section 2 of Republic Act 1394 authorized the increase of the </span>spe<span style="">cial import tax for the "succeeding
calendar year," from which said Court deduced that said increase could </span>apply
<span style="">only, to importations made on the 15th
day after the </span>publi<span style="">cation of the
proclamation in the Official Gazette, on October 8</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">1959,
or subsequently thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue boils down to
this: Does the phrase “</span>succe<span style="">eding
calendar year,” in section 2 refer to the </span>year <span style="">succeeding the issuance or publication of the <u>proclamation</u>
suspending the operation of the rate set forth in </span>section <span style="">1, or to the "<u>calendar year</u>"
in which the total revenue </span>derived from customs duties and special
import tax is<span style=""> </span>less than the
proceeds from the exchange tax imposed during the year 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Tax Court adopted the first alternative;
buts we find that the answer must be <span style="">otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to said section
2, "if as a result of </span>ap­plication <span style="">of the schedule" provided in section 1, </span>"the <span style="">total revenue derived from the customs duties
and from the special import tax on goods, articles or products imported from
the United States is less <u>in any calendar </u></span><u><span style="">year</span></u><span style=""> </span>than the proceeds from the exchange tax imposed under Republic
Act 601, as amended, on such goods, <span style="">arti</span>cles
or products during the calendar year 1955" - in which Republic Act 1394 <span style="">was </span>approved
- "the President may<span style=""> </span>by
proclamation suspend the reduction of the special import tax for the <u>next
succeeding calendar year</u> as prescribed in the schedule” aforementioned
"and in order to restore the total revenue to he collected <span style="">on </span>the importation of United States
goods, articles or products to the level of the exchange tax thereon during the
<span style="">calendar </span>year
1955, increase the special import tax on <span style="">all
</span>goods coming from any country for such <u>succeeding </u><u><span style="">calenda</span>r year</u> to any previous <span style="">rate </span>proved
for in this Act which<span style=""> </span>deemed
necessary to restore the said revenue to the level attained in the calendar
year 1955."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is obvious, from the
context and spirit </span>of <span style="">this
provision that the expression "succeeding calendar </span>year"
refers, <u>not</u> to the "year" succeeding the issuance of the
executive <u>proclamation</u> increasing the rate of special import tax, but to
the “<u>calendar year”</u> following that in which "the total revenue
derived from customs duties and from the special import tax on goods, articles
or products imported from the United States is <span style="">less x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>than
the proceeds from the exchange tax imposed under Republic Act Numbered 601 on
such goods, articles or pro­ducts during the calendar year 1955."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, the phrase
"succeeding calendar year" </span>could<span style=""> not refer, either to the </span>period <span style="">immediately following </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">issuance of said proclamation,
or to the </span>calendar year subsequent thereto, because:</p>

<blockquote>1. The proclamation could not possibly be issued before the
expiration of the calendar year in which a reduction of the total revenues
derived from customs duties and special import taxes has taken place, because
the data essential to determine the rate of increase to is ordered by the
President can not be completed before the end of said year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Since it would generally take some time, after the close of said
"calendar year," to gather <span style="">aid
</span>data, the proclamation could not possibly be issued at the very first
day of the "calendar year" next following;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Inasmuch as the, proclamation would necessarily have to be
issued sometime after said day, the result would be - if the view taken by the
Tax Court were, accepted - that the reduction in the total revenue for the <span style="">preceding year could not be offset
immediately there­after, but would have to wait until, at least, one full year
later, thus unduly delaying the application of remedy necessary to protect the
stability of our current and national economy.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evidently realizing that
the total revenue from customs duties and the special import tax for the year
1958 was less than the proceeds from the exchange tax imposed during the year
1955, and that the President would have to exercise his authority under Section
2(a but could not fix the rate of increase of the special import tax to be
ordered by executive proclamation, after the precise amount of said total
revenue </span>shall have <span style="">been
determined, the Commissioner of Customs, acting pursuance of instructions from
higher authorities, had ordered all collectors of customs to assess and
collection beginning from January 1, 1959, the special import tax at the rate
of 17%, subject to adjustment or liquidation, later on, in accordance with the
rate to be fixed by said proclamation, and, upon the issuance thereof, levied
and collected said tax at the rate so fixed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence all importers, including <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>,
were put on notice, since January 1, 1959, that the rate of 11.9% prescribed in
section 1 of Republic Act 1394 for the special import tax during that year
would be suspended and the rate thereof increased, pursuant to section 2 of
said Act, although the specific rate of said increase would be fixed by
proclamation to be issued by the President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> has paid said tax, at the rate
of 17% on each one of </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">importations, during the year 1959, prior to
the issuance said proclamation, and, at the rate of 15.3% fixed there for its
subsequent importations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and Section 11 of the Revised Administrative Code, the Tax Court <span style="">held that Proclamation No. 601 "became
effective only after fifteen (15) days" from the actual release, on
September 22, 1959, of the issue of the Official Gazette of July 27, 1959, in
which the proclamation was published, or "only on October 8, 1959."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 11 of the Revised
Administrative Code does not bear out the view taken by the Tax Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, said section refers to
statutes "passed by the Congress of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">." It does not apply to executive
proclamations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, such statutes
"take ef­fect at the beginning of the fifteenth day after the completion
of the publication of' the statute in the Official Gazette," but, only,
"in the </span><span style="">absence </span><span style="">of special provision," or, in the
language of Article 2 of the Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, "unless it is otherwise provided"
in the statute or law involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proclamation No. 601 expli­citly declares, however, that the rate of
increase wherein fixed shall be in force "during the calendar year 1959,
starting from January 1." Thirdly, said section 11 of the Revised
Administrative Code provides, also, that for the purpose thereof, "the
Gazette is </span><u><span style="">conclusively</span></u><span style=""> <u>p</u></span><u><span style="">resumed</span></u><span style=""> to be
published on the date indicated therein as the date of issue." The Tax
Court contravened this provision when it considered, not the date appearing in
the issue of the Official Gazette in which the proclamation appeared, but </span>the
actual date of release of said issue.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the cases cited
in the decision of slid Court are not in point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Bonje</span> case construed, not section 11 of
the Revised Administrative Code, but </span>a <span style="">provision of Article 2 of the Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> relative to the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of <span class="SpellE">Que</span>

Central Bank Circular No. 20, dated </span><st1:date year="1949" day="9" month="12"><span style="">December 9, 1949</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was not published in the Official

explicitly provided that they shall "take effect fifteen days after its
publication in the Official Gazette." Upon the other hand, in the case of
Chan Hen the decision of the Court of Appeals was based upon the penal nature
of the circular<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
involved therein, like that sought to be applied in the <span class="SpellE">Que</span>
