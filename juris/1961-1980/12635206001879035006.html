				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before the Court for automatic review of a decision of
the Circuit Criminal Court, Sixth Judicial District, convicting defendant
Victor Abuda y Inceso of the crime of murder, and sentencing him to the extreme
penalty and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Rodolfo Bermejo in the sum
of P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>, as well as to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that as Rodolfo Bermejo was leaving the Summer
Place Restaurant at Magsaysay Boulevard, Sampaloc, Manila, on April 7, 1968, at
about 4:00 a.m., several men ran after him from said restaurant and stabbed him
on different parts of the body, particularly on the back, thereby inflicting
upon him several injuries, two (2) of which caused his death soon after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="5">May
 8, 1968</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was filed with the
Court of First Instance of Manila, charging Victor Abuda y Inceso with murder,
as one of the killers of <st1:place>Bermejo</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged in said information:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about April 7, 1968, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together with one
whose true name and identity are still unknown, and helping each other, with
treachery and with the use of superior strength, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill, attack, assault and use
personal violence upon one Rodolfo Bermejo by then and there stab­bing him
several times with a sharp bladed ins­trument on different parts of his body,
thereby inflicting upon him mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate
cause of his death moments thereafter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After arraignment, an ex-parte urgent motion for postpone­ment of
the trial was filed, on <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1968</st1:date>,
in the name of the Citizens' Legal Assistance Committee, as counsel for the
accused, by Gonzalo W. Gonzalez and Associates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion, signed by Atty. Mario A. Aguinaldo, was granted on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1968</st1:date>, and the case reset for
trial on <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of Atty. Aguinaldo, the trial was,
on the date last <span class="GramE">mentioned</span>, postponed, once more, to <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the case appears to have been
transferred to the Circuit Criminal Court of the Sixth Judicial Dis­trict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1968</st1:date>, the latter court caused the case to be set for trial on <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corresponding notice of hearing was
served upon Gonzalo W. Gonzalez &amp; Associates on <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the case was <span class="GramE">called for hearing in the morning of
</span><st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 5,
 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, neither</span> Atty. Aguinaldo nor
any other attorney appeared as counsel for the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Circuit Criminal Court, accordingly,
required Atty. Aguinaldo to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why he should
not be dealt with for contempt of court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It, moreover, designated, as counsel <u>de oficio</u> for the accused,
Atty. Lupino Lazaro, who forthwith conferred with his client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while, the trial took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution introduced the testimony of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) Camilo Casaclang, the physician, in the
Medico-Legal Division of the Manila Police Department, who examined the body of
Bermejo; 2) Uy Siong, kitchen manager of the aforementioned restaurant, who
identified the defendant herein as one of those who had stabbed Rodolfo
Bermejo; and 3) Patrolman Ramon A. Padre, of said Police Department, who
investigated the occurrence and apprehended defendant herein, in Caloocan City,
on May 7, 1968, or one month after the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence for the ac­cused was his
own testimony to the effect that he was at <st1:street><st1:address>No. 50-D
  Oxford Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Cubao, <st1:city><st1:place>Quezon
  City</st1:place></st1:city>, cooking corn, at the time of the
occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the presentation of
such testimony, def­endant's counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u> stated that he had
another witness, namely, one Urbano Parana, and that since the latter was not
present in court and his testimony would be corroborative in nature, he
(counsel) was constrained to dispense with such evidence and, accordingly,
rested his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the deci­sion
appealed from was rendered in open court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, December 6, 1968, Atty. Aguinaldo filed a motion to
set aside said decision and for a new trial, upon the ground that, although
notice of the hearing scheduled for Decem­ber 5, 1968 had been served upon his
office on December 3, he did not receive it until December 6, the notice having
been placed on the table of another attorney, who did not see it because he was
then in Mindoro; that on December 5, Atty. Aguinaldo was in Pasig, Rizal
attending another hearing which had been scheduled before the case at bar; that
none of his associates in the law office could attend the trial of defendant
herein, because they had hearings scheduled on the same date; and that the
accused had several wit­nesses to corroborate the alibi set up by him, namely,
Urbano Parana, Elpidio Gachol and Alejandro Inceso, whose respective addresses
were given in the motion, which was denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Atty. Aguinaldo was found guilty of contempt and fined P150,
apart from being given a warning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the records of the case were forwarded to this Court for
automatic review, in view of the penalty meted out to the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that defendant herein is charged with a capital
offense; that the notice setting this case for trial on December 5, 1968 was
not seasonably received by his counsel of record, Atty. Mario A. Aguinaldo; and
that the accused was assisted in said trial by a counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>,
who, having been designated as such, on the same date, shortly before the
trial, had very limited time to prepare therefor, the Court feels that, in the
interest of justice, it would be best to remand this case to the lower court
for the reception of such additional evidence as the parties may have, and the
rendition of another decision based upon such evidence and those introduced on
December 5, 1968, which need not be retaken.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside
and the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings, without
special pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
