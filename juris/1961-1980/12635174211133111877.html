				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It has been aptly remarked that a judge is not fortune's
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His lot is far from easy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is his duty to decide, a task that in­variably
is a test of one's character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower
he is in the judicial hierarchy, the more times he is called upon to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What­ever be his decision,
necessarily one party is disappointed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Un­fortunately, it is a rare litigant who does not feel somehow offended
when he loses; it is human nature to vent his dissatisfaction partly on the
hapless arbiter, whom he may even suspect of partiality.</p>

<p class="BODY">That brings up a related matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like every human being, a judge is subject to the influence of
prepossessions and preferences, at times deeply and intensely felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the moment one wears the
judicial robe, his personal likes and dislikes should be brought under the
strictest control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His guiding principle
should be one of the utmost objectivity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the ideal; it must, as much as possible, be lived up to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise he fails in his grave responsi­bility;
he is recreant to his trust.</p>

<p class="BODY">These observations gain pertinence in the disposition of the
complaint for disbarment principally against City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr. of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City,
included in which however are his two brothers, <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Superable</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
both members of the bar filed by one Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>
with the Court on <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge against Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>
was one for gross misconduct in office, impugning alleged acts of harassment,
persecution and oppression, resulting in the filing of an unwarranted complaint
against petitioner and his being cited unjustifiably for contempt for which he
was found guilty without his being accorded due process, resulting in an order
of April 1, 1965 adjudging complainant guilty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two other respondents in the petition before us, Attorneys <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, were
accused of collusion with their brother, respondent Judge, in insti­gating
"persons under their influence and persons whom they knew to be harboring
hatred, envy and jealousy against [petitioner <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>]
to fabricate incriminatory acts against [petitioner]" as well as acting as
"prosecutors" for their brother, respondent City Judge, in an
investigation conducted by an Assistant City Fiscal.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1968</st1:date>,
we issued a resolution requiring the re­spondents to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such answers were duly filed, all three
respondents denying the charges and seeking the dismissal of the charges
against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1968</st1:date>, in another resolution, we referred
the charges for investigation to the Executive Judge of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
for investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such report with its recommendation was submitted to us on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1969</st1:date> by Executive Judge
Elias B. Asuncion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The report appears to be characterized by an approach informed by
sympathy and understanding for the actuations of respondent Judge, not
surprising, considering that the Investigator likewise belongs to the judicial
branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, it is not for that
reason alone to be altogether received with skepticism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, undoubtedly, there was an effort to be
fair and just in the appraisal of the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, its being quite thorough and detailed would dissipate any
suspicion that the charges against respondent Judge were not seriously scrutinized
and inquired into.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not follow, though, that we should accept it in its
entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its recommendation of complete
exoneration of respondent Judge is much too generous under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot say, especially
with reference to the contempt incident, that respondent Judge's behavior
complained of did not lay any basis for the charge against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the most, the evidence would not suffice
for a finding of grave misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
it would seem that an admo­nition at the very least is called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would be evident from the appraisal of
what transpired as meticulously set forth in the report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar, however, as his two brothers, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Superable</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>
are concerned, the recommendation for exoneration by the Investigator is well
taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this opinion, the case against
Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> would be taken up first.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The charge for grave misconduct against Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, arising from the filing of a criminal complaint
against petitioner, was disposed of thus in the report of the
Investigator:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In this Criminal
Case No. 11095, the aggrieved parties were Attys. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Superable</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
as shown in the information quoted in the decision, except for the fact that
the name of City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., has
incidentally been mentioned in the supposed libelous statement contained in the
letter of petitioner Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> to the President
of the Philippines, which was the subject of the libel charge in said Criminal
Case No. 11095.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not even appear
that respondent Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., was
ever a witness in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
subject of the libel charge in Criminal Case No. 11095 was the alleged libelous
statement that has reference to Attys. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, there is no concrete and positive
showing from the evidence adduced by the herein petitioner to establish any
collusion between the respondent City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
Jr., and his brothers, the respondents Attys. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Supe­rable</span>,
in the filing of the complaint for libel against the herein peti­tioner in the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Babatñgon</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, which generated the filing by the Provincial Fiscal
of Criminal Case No. 11095.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true
that in the decision of the Court in said case, there is a statement, now
marked Exhibit 'B-1', to the effect that 'this case is a second attempt on the
part of City Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> to hold the accused to
answer the crime of libel arising from the same letter-complaint which the
accused had written to the President', but it must be noted from the context of
the decision, and especially the explana­tory discussion on this point, that
the afore-quoted statement of the Court was predicated merely upon what the
Court termed as a very 'reasonable suspicion, unless it is by mere coincidence,
that the <span class="SpellE">Avestruz</span> brothers were a willing tool to a
systematic and persistent effort towards the successful filing of a libel case
against the accused for the same letter which was the subject of that libel
charge filed with the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.' And let
it be said that suspicion alone, with­out more, could not supply an infallible
premise upon which an incontrovertible conclusion could be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be highly unfair for respondent City
Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., to suffer conviction of
a charge based merely upon conjectures that are vague and sometimes misleading,
if not treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be stated
in this regard, however, that when the Court in its decision in Criminal Case
No. 11095 made reference to that case being a second attempt on the part of
City Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> to hold the accused for the
crime of libel arising from the same letter-complaint which the accused had
written to the President, that was the seventh of other six converging and
contributory points or factors which the Court had considered in arriving at
the conclusion that the guilt of the accused, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>,
was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Investigator, therefore, concludes that Exhibits 'B' and 'B-1', for
that matter, cannot, by themselves, establish the charge of collusion between
the respondent Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., on one
hand, and his brother respondents, on the other, in persecuting or harass­ing
or oppressing the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to
be further stated here that the filing of Criminal Case No. 949 for libel
against Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, which was docketed in the
Court of First Instance as Criminal Case No. 11095, had also been the
specification of a charge of abuse of authority filed by the petitioner,
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, against Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., in Administrative Case No. 27, for which
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> had been exonerated by the
Department of Justice upon a recommendation of the District Judge who investi­gated
him."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigator dealt with the charge of persecution and
oppression based on Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable's</span> order citing
complainant for contempt thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
Complainant claims in his offer of evidence that that order is an act of
persecution and oppression on the part of the said respondent upon the herein
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Investigator does not
see how this order, standing by itself alone, could indicate or show any
persecution or oppression on the part of respondent City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
to be noted from the order referred to that said order was made in connection
with a contempt proceedings against Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>
arising from a letter sent by Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> to the
Secretary of Justice branding the respondent as partial in the adjudication of
a case instituted against him, entitled 'People of the Philippines versus
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>' for grave threats, docketed in the
Court of the respondent as Criminal Case No. R-7056.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[At most], if the said order was not proper,
it could only amount to an abuse of authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let it, however, be said that the order (Exhibit 'C') referred to had
been issued by respondent Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
Jr., in the exercise of his judicial authority or in the discharge of his
official function which has nothing to do, strictly speaking with his actuation
as a member of the bar."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was moreover noted by the Investigator:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It may be stated at this juncture that
for Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde's</span> having been punished for
contempt of Court by respondent City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
Jr., this had been included as one of the charges (in fact, deno­minated as
Charge 1) in Administrative Case No. 25 * * * which was generated by an
administrative complaint filed by Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>
against respondent City Judge Nicolas A. <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that Administrative Case No. 25,
the investigator, who happens now to be investigator in this case, made the
following recommendation in so far as this charge is concerned:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It is, therefore, recommended that the
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> be reprimanded and that he
should be admonished to be more tolerant in allowing a party aggrieved or who
believes himself to be aggrieved, by his conduct and actuations as a Judge, and
to be more discreet in the exercise of the coercive power of contempt, the
exercise of which right may unnecessarily, and when without legal basis, bring
about the unjust curtailment of individual freedoms and human rights.' * * *
This recommendation of the Investigating Judge in Administrative Case No. 25
was approved by the Department of Justice in a 5th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>,
dated September 2, 1966 * * * when it said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Wherefore, this Department hereby approves the recommendation of the
District Judge to reprimand the respondent and to warn him to be more discreet
in the exercise of the drastic power to cite for contempt, otherwise, repetition
of the same or other improper acts will be more severely dealt with.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore concerning this contempt incident resulting in an
order of respondent Judge of <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="5">May 6,
 1965</st1:date> ordering arrest of petitioner after having been sentenced to
twenty days imprisonment, the report of the Investigator likewise had the
following to say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This order by re­spondent
City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., was issued in
connection with the contempt proceedings against Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, as the respondent in that contempt
proceedings refused to appear before the Court and had chosen to send his wife
and his counsel only, the re­spondent Judge [believed he] could compel the
presence of respondent Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> by the issuance
of the coercive process of arrest, and as the respondent had believed that it
was an appropriate case for indirect contempt, he necessarily had to compel the
attendance of the respondent with the issuance of the warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In proper proceedings of contempt, Section 3
of Rule 71 authorizes the Court, in contempt proceedings, to issue any process
to bring the accused party into Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is what respondent City Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>
had done in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the
act, constituting what Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> had believed
to be an indirect contempt, had been found in Administrative Case No. 25,
entitled Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, petitioner, versus City
Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., respondent, to have
been improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, * * *, the respondent City Judge
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> set aside his first decision
declaring Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> guilty of contempt of Court
and also set aside the order for his arrest in order to give the respondent <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> another chance to show cause why he should not be
punished for contempt of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contempt proceedings ultimately resulted [in] a decision rendered by respondent
Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., on <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1965</st1:date>, finding Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> guilty of contempt of court and sentencing him to pay
a fine of P25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be stated that
this decision holding Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> in contempt of
court was never appealed by him but <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> voluntarily
paid the P25 fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it has
already been said that for the indiscreet act of the respondent in finding <span class="SpellE">Conde</span> guilty of indirect contempt of court and in
sentencing him to pay a fine of P25, respondent City Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>, Jr., was penalized in Administrative Case No.
25, where <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, as previously stated, had made this
incident as one of the specifi­cations of a charge of abuse of authority on the
part of respondent City Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While Judge <span class="SpellE">Superable's</span> conduct could
stand improvement, to put it at its mildest, the additional penalty of
disbarment sought is not justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the other extreme, exoneration is not warranted either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does appear that the charge of grave
misconduct allegedly consisting of harassment, oppression and persecution was
not made out, even with the introduction of other documentary evidence
purportedly indicative of the animosity of respondent Judge towards petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, he should have taken greater pains to
avoid the impression that his personal feelings were not kept under control, as
is rightfully expected of a judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is an added responsibility of the most serious character assumed by a member of
the bar honored with an appointment to the bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should on that account be ad­monished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must take pains to assure that thereafter
his conduct would not be thus tainted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should not be forgotten either that for the infraction
committed by respondent Judge, he had been administratively made to suffer as
noted above.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The imputation of wrongdoing directed at his brothers,
Attorneys <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>
and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span> suffers, from inherent
frailty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no wonder then that the
Investigator recom­mended their exoneration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To quote from the report:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"As regards the respondents, Attys. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Superable</span> and Angel <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
as the evidence extent on the record tending to prove the charges against them
consists primarily and [exclusively of] mere allusions and conclusions made by
the counsel of the petitioner in his offer of evidence, the Investigator humbly
concludes that the charges against these particular respondents have not been
established."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. A reminder as to the standard of judicial conduct that must be
met is never amiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been aptly
remarked, and quite truly, that adjudication should not only be fair and
just.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must appear to be so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge is human, but he is expected to rise
above human frailties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very
least, there must be an earnest and sincere effort on his part to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a litigant is therefore an individual
for whom he does not cherish kindly thoughts, he is called upon to show greater
care lest inadvertently he finds himself unable to resist the prompting of his
emotions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps of no government
official is the truism that a public office is a public trust more
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He dispenses justice for the
community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is its instrument to
assure that every one be given his due.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He speaks and acts for the state, not for himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His personal feelings must not get the better
of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he must not for a moment
forget.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Superable</span>,
Jr., is hereby admonished, with the warning that repetition of such conduct as
did mar his actuation as a member of the judiciary would be more severely dealt
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attorneys <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
