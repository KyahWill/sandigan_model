<p class="BODY">Looming large in the resolution of these cases is the fact that
the <u>original</u> <u>entries</u> in the return for Precinct 8 would show that

"89" votes and <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>

577 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In which case, <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> should have been

entries - as to <span class="SpellE">Balindong’s</span> votes - in the election
return from Pre­cinct 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This altered
election return shows that the word "Thirteen" and the figure
"13" corresponding to the votes of <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> were crossed out and, instead, the word
"Eight" and figure "8" were placed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is, that <span class="SpellE">Alim</span>

<p class="NUM">1. The validity of the <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1967</st1:date> canvass and proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Uso</span>
Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> as Mayor-elect is the issue in L-29617.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There surfaces a number of reasons for
thumbing down said canvass and proclamation for being invalid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The canvassing board of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span> was
illegally constituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three substitute
members thereof were recommended by the local chapter of the Liberal Party, and
not by the local chapter of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party to
which the substituted members belonged at the time of their
disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This violates Section
167 of the Revised Election Code as clarified by the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ibuna</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Com­mission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE"><u>Ibuna</u></span> case explains that said Section 167
requires the substitute members of the municipal board of canvassers to be <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span> of the <u>political</u> <u>party</u> <u>to</u>
<u>which</u> <u>the</u> <u>substituted</u> <u>members</u> <u>belonged</u> <u>at</u>
<u>the</u> <u>time</u> <u>of</u> <u>their</u> <u>disqualification</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While granting that <span class="SpellE"><u>Ibuna</u></span> was
promulgated after <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> issued its instruction to
the municipal treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span> to appoint as
substitute members of the canvassing board, the <span class="SpellE">recom­mendees</span>
of the party <u>to</u> <u>which</u> <u>the</u> <u>disqualified</u> <u>members</u>
<u>belonged</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>time</u> <u>of</u> <u>their</u> <u>election</u>
<u>in</u> <u>1963</u>, this fact does not remove the illegal taint from the
appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ibuna</u></span>
merely declared the true impact of the existing law in the Revised Election
Code, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 167.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Municipal</u>
<u>board</u> <u>of</u> <u>canvassers</u>.- (a) The municipal council shall
constitute the muni­cipal board of canvassers, excluding the members who are
candidates and who shall be replaced by the Commission en Elections with
registered voters of the same party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the time <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> issued the
directive to the municipal treasurer, the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
was, as it continues to be, the existing law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> instruction is, therefore,
contrary to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointments made
by the municipal treasurer in compliance with said instruction cannot fare any
better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, too, are illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Giving added cause for invalidity of the canvass is the finding
of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Adap</span>, a member of the can­vassing board, and the
candidates, were not notified of the transfer of the boards meeting to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marawi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of the
protestations of <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span>
in his petition that Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span> <span class="SpellE">Adap</span> and the candidates were actually notified or had

a credibility gap exists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal

actually notified of the transfer to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marawi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>

Besides, no <u>written</u> <u>notice</u> of such transfer was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contravenes <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
explicit instructions to municipal treasurers contained in <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
Resolution RR-544, promulgated <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="9">September
 11, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In, this case, a notice of the transfer to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marawi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
is important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first notice allegedly
issued by the Municipal Treasurer on November 19, 1967 served to notify those
concerned that the canvass was "temporarily set" at the PC Barracks
in <span class="SpellE">Pindolonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span> at
9:00 a.m. of November 20, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was nothing certain about the meeting in <span class="SpellE">Pindolonan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said notice of November 19 (for the
meeting the next day) also conveyed, the idea that the board of canvassers had
not, as of then, been constituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it
any wonder then that many of those notified did hesitate to go to the tentative
meeting at the tentative place?</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if such notice were actually served, the municipal
treasurer himself did not wait at the PC Barracks in <span class="SpellE">Pindolonan</span>,
the temporary meeting place, but at his residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This and the fact that the members of the
canvassing board converged at his residence and not in the PC Barracks is
indicative of an earlier intention not to hold the meeting at the PC Barracks
at all, or at least, the uncertainty of the meeting and the place thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, for failure to give sufficient notice to a member who was
not disqualified, and to the candidates, the meeting of the board of canvassers
of <span class="SpellE">Ganassi</span> was null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Such failure is, at least, <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
regulations of <span class="SpellE">Comelee</span> [in RR-544].</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, even if it be conceded that Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Adap</span> was actually notified of the transfer to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marawi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but failed to attend, still, <span class="SpellE">Kiram</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Buruan</span>, the municipal treasurer, should not have taken his
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By so doing, <span class="SpellE">Buruan</span>
exceeded the instructions given to him by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a representative of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
he should have inhibited himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For,
in the appointment of substitute members to the municipal canvassing board,
party affiliation is - by law - the prime consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thereby subverted, the intention of the
election, code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No law authorizes him to
sit as member of the canvassing board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why should he cast himself into the melee of petty political rivalry?</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still is that the
members of the board of can­vassers failed to follow the line of proper
canvassing of election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the

ministerial function of a board of canvassers to count the results as they
appear in the returns <u>which</u> <u>on</u> <u>their</u> <u>face</u> <u>do</u>

Alleged tampering must there­fore be ascertained, first by the canvassing
board, then by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal treasurer's copy of the return from Precinct 8 used
by the board reveals on its face palpable material alterations as to <span class="SpellE">Balindong's</span> votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The change in, rather subtraction from, <span class="SpellE">Balindong's</span>
votes made the difference between victory and defeat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such alterations were not judicially
authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor were they even initialed
by the inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, as far as
the canvassing board was concerned, the election return copy before it,
contained unauthorized alterations which are irregularities that could prevent
a proper canvass and necessitate an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the board jumped investigation and
canvassed the votes based on returns palpably tampered.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is another reason why <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
conclusion that the <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1967</st1:date>
canvass and proclamation are null and void must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most serious dispute,
we perceive, is as to the<span style="">&nbsp; </span> number of
votes that should be counted for <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> in Precinct 8.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To repeat:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we count his votes
as "8", as <span class="SpellE">Uso</span> Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span>
would have it, Use Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> would be credited with
575 votes and <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
572 votes, or a difference of 3 votes in favor of the former; if, on the other
hand, the votes for Mini <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> were tallied as
"13", he would receive a total of 577 votes while <span class="SpellE">Uso</span>
Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> would garner the same 575 votes, but <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> would have to be
declared winner by 2 votes.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first question that presents itself is this: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Under the circumstances, what should have been
the procedure in ascer­taining the true votes cast for Precinct 8 for purposes

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> view is that the board of
inspectors should file a petition for correction in the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This remedy is now unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we are confronted with are tam­pered
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, a petition for
judicial correction of the returns is a privilege left to the members of the
board of inspectors themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
than this, "unanimous consent of all the members of the board" is
required to effect correction.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

It is a dis­tinct remedy, unrelated to the investigatory procedure for tampered
returns before <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. When and by whom was the tampering really made?</p>

<p class="BODY">Testimony furnished by the members of the board of inspectors
before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> leaves much to be desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their oral evidence shows that the election
returns were prepared by the chairman of the board of inspectors; that after
publication of the results of the elec­tion and the board of inspectors had
issued the certificates of votes of candidates to the different watchers and
after the watchers had gone, it occurred to the chairman of the board of
inspectors to suggest that the returns be checked with the tally sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it was then that they allegedly
discovered their "mistake":<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that the number of votes for <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, as shown in the tally sheet, was "8";
and that the returns had to be corrected to show that <span class="SpellE">Alim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> received merely "8" instead of
"13" votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the
known result of this <u>alteration</u> is that <span class="SpellE">Uso</span>
Dan <span class="SpellE">Aguam</span> was made to win with a majority of 3 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">This explanation is shot through with holes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
examination of the return itself would show that the alleged correction was
made in the case of only one candidate, <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
testimony there was that such alteration was effected by the chairman himself, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> found otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> declared that the alterations were
done in blue ink, while the original entries - which admittedly were made by
the chairman himself - were in red ink; and that the substituted word
"Eight" was written "with apparently different
handwriting." One has merely to look at the return, Exhibit Q, to be
convinced that the writing with a heavy hand of the corrected word
"Eight" and the corrected figure "8" is totally different
from the light handwriting of the rest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really, it
is hard to believe that the inspectors, could have so unceremoniously made
corrections after they issued the certificates of votes to the watchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They knew that by so doing they would violate
Section 154 of the Election Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 154.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Alterations</u>
<u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>statement</u>.- After the announcement of the result of
the election in the polling place, the board of inspectors shall not make any
alteration or amendment in any of its statements, unless it be so ordered by a
competent court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if it
were true that these corrections were made shortly after the inspectors issued
the certificates of votes to the watchers, it is strange that these corrections
did not bear the initials of the members of the board of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter did not even draw up formal
minutes of that important proceeding <u>so</u> <u>decisive</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>political</u> <u>fortunes</u> <u>of</u> <u>candidates</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Balindong</u></span> <u>and</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Aguam</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
allegedly genuine tally sheet which the inspectors claim to be the true tally
sheet and which was found in the ballot box does not as much as carry the signature
of even one of the inspectors, The spaces in the tally sheet corresponding to
the signatures of the members of the board were indeed in blank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seal of this tally sheet is four-fifths
broken.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fifth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corrections
were allegedly made after everybody had gone and the inspectors and the poll
clerk were left alone, But, why rely on the unsigned tally sheet when the votes
were also tallied on a blackboard in the 'precinct itself for others to see?</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Sixth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there was
a mistake, that mistake could have readily been detected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the evidence of record reveals that
while' counting was being made, the watchers were there, watching and
witnessing the whole proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
quite reasonable to assume that if the real votes counted were not merely "13"
but "8" for <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, that could not have
easily escaped notice, what with the election officials themselves counting and
tallying and the watcher's of the opposing candidates listening and observing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Seventh</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason
is given why after the watchers had left, like a bolt from the clear blue, it
should occur to these inspectors to check the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They declared that they altered all the
copies of the returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, as it
turned out, the ballot box copy, which by the way was signed only by the LP
inspector, remained unaltered.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Eighth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of ail of these alleged mistakes, not one of the
inspectors breathed out a word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did
not recall the certificates of votes they issued to the watchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did they issue corrected
certificates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the record
would suggest that they took steps to notify <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
the losing mayor­alty candidates, especially <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, to enable the latter to take step's to protect
his own interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us not for a
moment forget that <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>
ran as an independent LP <u>without</u> ins­pectors.</p>

<p class="BODY">That there was tampering of the returns from Precinct 8 we do not
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mute but formidable is Exhibit Q
- the copy of the return for <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shows that the tampering from
"Thirteen" to "Eight" was by a hand different from that of
the chairman who wrote the original words and figures in said returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such falsifi­cation was obviously fathered by
one without scruples and done long after the counting of the votes and the
certification thereof by the inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The people's will expressed at the polls, it must be stressed, should
not be frustratingly hamstrung by permitting use of false, tampered or spurious
returns or returns illegally cor­rected by wrongdoers in the hope of grabbing
the proclamation for a candidate who, to all appearances, was repudiated by the
people.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The factual makeup with respect to Precinct 8 may thus be
summarized as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies for the
municipal treasurer, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the provincial
treasurer of the returns are all tampered:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Thirteen" to "Eight" votes for <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ballot box copy containing the original
entry in ink, of "Thirteen" for <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>,
is signed only by the LP inspector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tally sheet, on which the inspectors' testimony was principally built, is unsigned,
its paper seal four-fifths broken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
custody of the ballot box and the sealing of the same are riddled with
irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the integrity of
the ballot box is open to grave doubts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem to us that the only reliable and <span class="SpellE">untampered</span> documents reflecting the results of the election
in Precinct 8 are the certificates of votes of candidates issued to the
watchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said certificates
certainly cannot serve as returns for canvassing purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial recount cannot legally be made either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 168, in relation to Section
163, of the Revised Election Code, such remedy is possible only “[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]n case of contradictions or discre­pancies between the
copies of the same statements." And, jurisprudence that has already taken
root is that said discrepancies must appear amongst the authentic returns, not
tampered returns.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">6. But is it still possible to canvass the return from Pre­cinct
8?</p>

<p class="BODY">There is an impressive unanimity on the part of all con­cerned -
the members of the board of inspectors included - that the original entries of
votes in the election return for Precinct 8 for <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> consist of the word "Thirteen" and the
figure "13".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Before</u> the
unauthorized alteration of those entries, the said return <u>bore</u> <u>the</u>
<u>guarantee</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>election</u> <u>officials'</u> <u>signatures</u>
<u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>scrutiny</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>watchers</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>opposing</u> <u>candidates</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It makes eminent sense to say that such election return - in its
original form - should not be allowed to cease as an instrument embodying the
expression of the people's will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A</u>
<u>way</u> <u>of</u> <u>preserving</u> <u>the</u> <u>integrity</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>election</u> <u>return</u>, <u>we</u> <u>believe</u>, <u>is</u> <u>by</u> <u>knocking</u>
<u>off</u> <u>the</u> <u>falsified</u> <u>words</u> <u>and</u> <u>figures</u> <u>and</u>
<u>restoring</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even conceding that the alteration of "13" to
"8" was done by the election inspectors, yet such act was
unauthorized by, and con­trary to, the provisions of Section 154 of the
election code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inspectors could not
plead ignorance to this, on the assumption that they really discovered this
"mistake".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is a <span class="SpellE">strategem</span> we are not prepared to legitimize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the dispiriting lesson in past elections
is that election returns are tampered to favor a candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election inspectors' strained explanation,
accord­ingly, is no substitute for the fact that the original words and figures
in the returns were unceremoniously changed.</p>

<p class="BODY">More.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original, entry
of "13" votes for <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span> is fully
corroborated by a hard-to-fault piece of evidence - the official cer­tificates
of votes a candidates for municipal mayor signed by all the inspectors and the
poll clerk as required by Section 153 of the election code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issuance of these certificates certainly
measures the emptiness of the inspectors' proffered explanation of
"mistake".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the said
certificates of votes of candidates bear the solemn representation to all and
sundry by the chairman, the LP inspector, the NP inspector and the poll clerk
(see Exhibits H and I) that "WE HEREBY CERTIFY that the candidates
mentioned below have obtained in this precinct the votes set opposite their
respective names:</p>
