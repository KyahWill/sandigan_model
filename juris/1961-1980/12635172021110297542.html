Service upon a motion to dismiss filed by said defendants before answer, under
Rule 8 of the Rules of Court of 1940. (Rule 16 of the present Rules.)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1963</st1:date>,
plaintiff-appellant Insurance Company of <st1:place>North America</st1:place>
instituted the action above-mentioned before <span class="GramE">the <u>a</u></span>

Agencies, Inc., and Bureau of Customs and/or Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint filed therein
alleged, that: On or about October 29, 1962, the SS "HAGUE MARU" took
on board at the port or Hamburg, Germany, 22 cases of carpenter's and
mechanic's tools, valued at $3,648.92 C &amp; F Manila, shipped by H. <span class="SpellE">Beutler</span> &amp; Co. of Germany to the consignee of the goods,
<span class="SpellE">Solex</span> Tool Corporation, Manila; in Japan, the said
cargo was <span class="SpellE">transhipped</span> from the SS "HAGUE
MARU" on board the SS "KIKUKO MARU" which supposedly dis­charged
the same in Manila in good order condition with the exception of three(3) cases
which were landed in bad order, unto the custody of defendant Bureau of Cus­toms
and/or Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service; the latter there­after
failed to deliver (to the consignee) portion of the goods, and claims for the
value of the lost goods, in the amount of P1,279.49, were filed against both de­fendants
Osaka <span class="SpellE">Shosen</span> Kaisha (O.S.K.-Line) and/or Ameri­can
Steamship Agencies, Inc., as owners and/or operators of the above-named vessels
and as agent and/or represent­ative of said owners, respectively, defendants
Bureau of Customs, operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service
at the port of Manila and its subsidiary, Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, as well as against plaintiff Insurance Company of North America, as
insurer of the said goods; said defendants failed and refused to pay; herein
plaintiff was compell­ed to pay the value of the lost goods and was thereby subrogated
to the rights of the owners thereof; the loss occurred while defendant carrier
had custody of the cargo and failed to discharge the same or, after discharge
of the cargo, while defendant Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service had custody of the goods, in either of which case, there was violation
of the duty to properly and safely carry and discharge, the goods on the part
of the carrier or, in the alternative, to make delivery of the goods on the
part of defendant Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service after dis­charge;
demands for reimbursement were duly made by plaintiff but defendants refused;
plaintiff was there­upon compelled to obtain the services of counsel incur­ring
thereby further damages as or by way of attorney's fees; and plaintiff is at
present uncertain against whom of defendants it is entitled to relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the personality of the defendants Bureau of Customs and/or
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, the allegation in said
complaint reads:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Bureau of
Customs is to the best information, knowledge and<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>belief of plaintiff, a government office
organized under the Customs Law, the operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
ser­vice at the Port of Manila since November 21, 1962 through its Branch
office/subsidiary, defend­ant Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, charged with the duty of receiving imported cargo discharged from
ocean vessels and of safekeeping the same for delivery to consignees or owners
thereof upon delivery being authorized by defendant Bureau of Customs and upon
the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> fee being paid, with office address at
the Terminal Build­ing, Port Area,. Manila, where it may be served with
summons." (Record on Appeal, p. 3)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On these premises, plaintiff prayed for judgment order­ing
defendants to pay, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, "jointly and
severally or whichever of defendants may be found liable to pay
plaintiff", the value of the lost goods.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, upon motion of defendants Bureau of Customs
and/or Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, based on the ground
that the cause of action alleged against them did not come within the
jurisdiction of the court of first in­stance but within that of the City Court
of Manila, on February 17, 1964, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed the
case against said defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upholding
the contention of said defendants, His Honor held that "in the instant
case .... <span class="GramE">the</span> defendant Osaka <span class="SpellE">Shosen</span>
Kaisha (O.S.K) is sued for breach of contract of carriage while the Bureau of
Customs and/or Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service is sued for
breach of con­tract of deposit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contract of carriage here involved is a maritime transaction and actions
arising from it are cognizable by the local Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract of deposit, on the other hand,
is, not maritime and actions arising from it in an amount not exceeding P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> are cognizable by the local City Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of Rule 2 subjects the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of causes of action 'to rules regarding
jurisdiction, venue, and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties.' In view
of the fact that the action against <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is
cognizable by the local City Court while the action against Osaka <span class="SpellE">Shosen</span> Kaisha is cognizable by the local Court of First
Instance, permissive <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties or causes of
action in the instant case cannot be properly allowed. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff must, therefore, determine for
sure which party to sue and where." <span class="GramE">(pp. 13-14, Record
on Appeal.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">From this order of dismissal, plaintiff has appeal­ed to this
Court assigning only two errors, namely:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>

ARRASTRE <st1:place><st1:city>SER­VICE</st1:city> <st1:state>ON</st1:state></st1:place>
A FINDING THAT IT HAD NO JURIS­DICTION OVER THE APPELLANT'S CAUSE OF ACTION AS

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE JOINDER OF PARTIES AND OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION IN THE
INSTANT SUIT CANNOT BE PROPERLY ALLOWED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">which</span> are
discussed together in appellant's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the two errors thus assigned by appellant are, <span class="GramE">in <span style="">&nbsp;</span>view</span> of the
majority of this Court, sustain­able, considering the already existing long
line of pre­cedents<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
holding that the ground of dismissal invoked by the trial court, as
above-quoted, is erroneous,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
We are, nevertheless, of the unanimous opinion that the present appeal cannot
prosper, because the case of the plaintiff-appellant suffers from a more
obvious and indubitable fatal defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is already definitely set­tled that herein defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
the Bureau of Customs and/or the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, being mere arms of the national government, are protected by the
non-suability of the Republic of the Philippines when­ever, it has not given
its consent to be sued,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
parti­cularly, where, as in this case, there is no allegation in the complaint
that said defendants, much less the Re­public, has given such consent.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have not raised
such defense at any stage of this case is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, whether We hold that the matter of
non-suability is jurisdictional, either over the subject-matter or of the
person of the defendants, or We consider it as failure to state a cause of
action, when the consent of the State is not alleged in the complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
as in this case, in line with the decision of this Court in American Insurance
Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., (see footnote No. 4) We
are all agreed that whichever of these three views may be the most accurate
one, said defense may be invoked by the courts <span class="SpellE"><u>sua</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>sponte</u></span> at any stage of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1968</st1:date>, this Court has dismissed cases similar to the one before <span class="GramE">Us</span> now even without awaiting for the briefs of the parties,
in order to save them and this Court needless expenses of time, money and
effort." (Do­mestic Ins. Co. of the Phil. vs. American Pioneer Line, <u>supra</u>,

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The effect of the holding in the
above-cited cases was stated in Fulton Insurance Co. <i>vs.</i> Manila Railroad
Co., <i><u>supra</u></i>, in the following language:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"The prevailing
rule is that a con­signee when uncertain of the place and time of the loss or
damage to its <span class="GramE">goods,</span> may in one case seek relief
alternatively, against the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operators under a
con­tract of deposit and the steamship company under a contract of carriage by
sea. The action calls for the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction, which
municipal courts do not have, and is within the original exclusive jurisdiction
of courts of first instance; ….. <span class="GramE">and</span> since section 5,
Rule 2 of the Rules of Court permits the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of
causes of action in the alternative, it follows that even if one of the causes
of action were within the exclusive jurisdict­ion of a lower court by reason of
the amount of the demand involved, the Court of First Instance ..... <span class="GramE">has</span> jurisdiction over both."</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
True it is that section 5 of Rule 2 of the Revised Rules of Court provides
that:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span>
<span class="SpellE">Joinder</span> of causes of action<span class="GramE">.-</span>
Subject to rules regarding jurisdiction, venue and <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of parties, a party may in one pleading state, in the alter­native or
otherwise, as many causes of action as he may have against an oppos­ing party
(a) if the said causes of act­ion arise out of the same contract, trans­action
or relation between the parties, or (b) if the causes of action are for demands
for money, or are of the same nature and character.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the cases falling under clause
(a) of the preceding paragraph, the act­ion shall be filed in the inferior
court unless any of the causes joined falls within the jurisdiction of the
Court of First Instance, in which case it shall be filed in the latter court.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In the cases falling under clause
the jurisdiction shall be determined by the aggregate amount of the demands, if
for money, or by their nature and character, if otherwise."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">and that under the second paragraph
of this provision, it is permissible to join in a single action in the Court of
First Instance a cause of action which <u>per</u> <u>se</u> is within the
exclusive original jurisdiction of the inferior court with another cause of
action coming under the exclusive origi­nal jurisdiction of the court of first
instance, provided that both causes arise out of the same contract, transaction
or relation between the parties or are for demands for money.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My doubt is as to the power of this
Court to promulgate such a rule as this. Indisputably, jurisdiction can be
conferred only by, a law of Congress, not by a rule of court, even as this
Court has constitutional powers of rule-making. Matters of jurisdiction involve
the conferment of power to act and are definitely substantive in character. On
the other hand, the constitutional inhibition is unequivocal:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">" Said</span> rule
... shall not diminish, increase or modify substantive rights." <span class="GramE">(sec. 13, Art.</span> VIII, Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Only the other day, precisely on
this point, the Chief Justice spoke for the Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Development Corporation <i>vs.</i> Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>, et al., G. R. No. L-26443 1969, <span class="SpellE">thiswise</span>:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> To begin with, the
jurisdiction of our courts over the subject-matter of <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>
controversies is governed by Rep. Act No. 296, as amended, pursuant to which
(Sec. 7 of Republic Act No. 3828) municipal courts shall have exclusive
original jurisdiction in all civil cases in which the demand, exclusive of
interest, or the value of the property in controversy' amounts to not more than
'ten thousand pe­sos.' Secondly, 'the power to define, prescribe, and apportion
the jurisdiction of the various courts' belongs to Congress (Sec. 2, Art. VIII
of the Constitution) and is beyond the rule-making power of the Sup­reme Court,
which is limited to matters 'concerning pleading, practice, and procedure in
all courts, and the admission to the practice of law.'<span class="GramE">(Sec.
13, Art VIII of the Cons­titution) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Can this Court declare by the
exercise of its rule-making power, not by jurisprudential inter­pretation, that
a case may be filed in a certain court, when the Judiciary Act or any other law
vests jurisdiction over said case in another court?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when We do it by interpretation, would
that not amount to unconstitutional judicial legislation, considering that the
Constitution gives this Court the rule-making only as to mat­ters of pleading,
practice and procedure and the admission of members of the bar?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until these questions are properly and
definitely resolved, I will choose to dispose of cases of the nature of the

which, I have also discussed in another footnote to this decision.</p>

This footnote is purely the opinion of the writer of this decision and is not intended
to bind this Court. The chief purpose is to clarify points of procedure which
have long been assailing my mind.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In my humble opinion, the decisions
of this Court upholding the non-suability of the Bureau of Customs and/or the
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service do not reveal a uniform,
definite and concrete rul­ing as to the exact ground why the case against said
bureau and service have been dismissed, even when such defense was raised for
the first time only in this Court in the course of the appeal and, in fact,
even if it had not been raised at all by said entities, and what is more, even
be­fore the parties have filed their briefs. As I see it, three approaches are
discernible from the opinions in these decided cases, albeit they are not
clearly expressed as such, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter; (2) lack of jurisdiction of the
person of the de­fendant; and (3) failure of the complaint to state a cause of
action, in cases where the consent of the Republic to be sued is not alleged in
the complaint. I consider it imperative that this point should be squarely
resolved, if only to erase any possible doubt as to the power of this Court to
dismiss <span class="SpellE"><u>sua</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>sponte</u></span>
cases against the Republic, filed without its consent, and at any stage the
appeals therein is found.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">As We all know it, there would be
no doubt as to such power, if the real ground of such dismissal were that the
lack of consent of the state for the bringing of the suit against it is that
because of such lack of consent, the court has no jurisdiction over the subject
matter, since it is elementary that this defense con be raised at any stage of
the proceedings and may even be raised collaterally.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In American Insurance Co. <i>vs.</i>
<span class="SpellE">Macondray</span>, <i><u>supra</u></i>, (see footnote No. 4)
however, this Court held;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">“Non-suability of
the State without its consent is one of the basic principles which underlie our
republican form of government. It derives its force from the will of the people
in freely creating a representative go­vernment through which they have agreed
to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the sove­reignty for the
common good and gene­ral welfare. (<span class="SpellE">Metran</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, L­1232, January 12, 1948) Justice Holmes has aptly
stated the basis for the principle thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"A sovereign is exempt from suit, not because of any formal
conception or obsolete theory, but on the legal and practical ground that there
can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the
right depends.' (<span class="SpellE">Kawanana­kaoa</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="SpellE">Polyblank</span>, 206 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
349) A contrary principle would dissipate the time and energy of the State in
endless suits against it, which would be sub­versive of the public interest.
(20 Supreme Court Reports Annotated 1108)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">My considered view is that, in
effect, this ruling means that the real reason why, from the procedural point
of view, a suit against the state filed without its consent must be dismissed
is because, necessarily, any such complaint cannot state a cause of action,
since, as the above decision confirms, "there can be no legal right as
against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends." That
a cause of action cannot exist unless the plaintiff has a legal right which the
defendant is under obligation to re­spect is such an unquestioned proposition
in remedial law that the citation of authorities to support it is superfluous.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The question that arises now is<span class="GramE">,</span> may failure to state a cause of action be alleged as a
ground of dismissal for the first time on appeal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Reyes <i>vs.</i> Court of
Appeals, this Court did hold that this ground of dismissal or defense may not
be raised for the first time on appeal but only in the trial court, but not
without some misgivings which were expressed in the separate concurring opinion
of then Mr. Justice, now Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Con­cepcion</span>,
in this succinct manner:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Failure of
defendant <span class="SpellE">lsmaela</span> <span class="SpellE">Dimagiba</span>
to allege in the Court of First Instance that plaintiffs have no cause of
action, cannot vest one to the latter if they have none. Said admission would
not warrant, therefore, a judgment for the plaintiffs if the records do not
show that they have a cause of action against the defendant. Hence, I find
myself unable to subscribe the view expressed in the main opinion of the Court,
insofar as it might seem to justify the opposite conclusion." (G. R. Nos.
L-5616 &amp; 5620, <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1954</st1:date>.)</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">To my mind, <span class="GramE">this
very apt observations</span> of the Chief Justice provide the perspective for
the solu­tion of the problem I have posed. Indeed, if a complaint suffers from
the infirmity of not stating facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
in the trial court, how could there be a cause of action in it just because the
case is already on appeal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, if a
complaint should be dismissed by the trial court because it states no cause of
action, how could such a complaint be the basis of a proceeding on appeal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer, I submit, is found in section 2
of Rule 9 which provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span> Defenses and objections not pleaded deemed
waived.- Defenses and ob­jections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or
in the answer are deemed waived; except the failure to state a cause of action
which may be alleged in a later pleading, if one is permitted, or by motion for
judgment on the plead­ings, or at the trial on the merits; but in the last
instance, the motion shall be disposed of as provided in section 5 of Rule 10
in the light of any evidence which may have been received. Whenever it appears
that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter, it shall dismiss
the action."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">According to this provision, while
it is true that failure to state a cause of action may be raised at the trial
on the merits, the motion in such respect must be resolved in the light of the
evidence that the plaintiff might have already presented at the time the question
is raised, such that, if plaintiff has already cured the defect by introducing
evidence on the omitted matter without objection of the defend­ant, the motion
should be denied; otherwise, it should be upheld. Consequently, it follows
logically that in cases where the defect of failure to state a cause of action
is under circumstances incurable, because there is no evidence that can be
presented to establish the missing element of the purported cause of action,
there is no reason why such a defense may not be in­voked for the first time on
appeal, since even by then the defect would still subsist. The requirement that
this defense should be raised at the trial is only to give the plaintiff a
chance to cure the defect of his complaint, but if, as in this case, the lack
of consent of the state cannot be cured because it is a matter of judicial
notice that there is no law allow­ing the present suit, (only Congress that can
give such consent) the reason for the rule cannot obtain, hence it is clear
that such non-suability may be raised even on appeal. After all, the record on
appeal can be examined to find out if the consent of the state is alleged in
the complaint.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">How about lack of jurisdiction of
the person of the defendant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
reported cases in this jurisdic­tion wherein dismissal on the ground of
non-suability was premised on lack of jurisdiction of the person of the
defendant. In Merritt <i>vs.</i> Government, 34 Phil. 311, this Court held:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"By
consenting to be sued a state simply waives its immunity from suit. It does not
thereby concede its liability to plaintiff, or create any cause of action in
his favor, or extend its liability to any cause not previously recognized. It
merely gives a remedy to enforce a preexisting lia­bility and submits itself to
the juris­diction of the court, subject to its right to interpose any lawful
defense."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span class="GramE">Likewise, in <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez, G. R. Nos.</span> L­20300-01,
20355-56, <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>, a
ruling of simi­lar view was laid down, thus:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"With
respect to the contention of the Republic of the Philippines that the order for
the reimbursement by it of such necessary expenses constitutes a judgment
against the government in a suit not consented by it, suffice it to say that
the Republic, on its own initia­tive, asked and was permitted to inter­vene in
the case and thereby submitted itself voluntarily to the jurisdiction of the
court."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">More explicitly, this Court ruled in
Salgado <i>vs.</i> Ramos, 64 Phil. 724, as follows:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">"For the
foregoing considerations, this court is of the opinion and so holds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) That the Insular Government, as
principal, is the really, interested party to an action brought to recover from
the Director of Lands interest allegedly charged in excess by said of­ficial in
the performance of his duties; and (2) that the presentation of the claim to
the Insular Auditor and the disapproval thereof are indispensable requi­sites
for the competent courts to acquire jurisdiction over the Government of the
Philippine Islands in actions involving moneyed claims."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">So, the question that arises again
is this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May such lack of jurisdiction
of the person of the defendant <span class="GramE">be</span> raised for the first
time on appeal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, once the
defendant enters his appearance or files an answer or otherwise submits
effectively to the juris­diction of the court, he cannot later on question such
jurisdiction over his person. It is plain, however, that as far as the state is
concerned, this rule of waiver cannot apply, for the simple reason that in the
case of the state, as already stated, the waiver may not be made by anyone
other than Congress, so any appearance in any form made on its behalf would be
in­effective and invalid if not authorized by a law duly passed by Congress.
Besides, the state has to act thru subalterns who are not always prepared to act
in the premises with the necessary capability, and instances, there can be when
thru ignorance, negligence or malice, the interests of the state may not be
properly protect­ed because of the erroneous appearance made on its be­half by
a government lawyer, or some other officer, hence, as a matter of public
policy, the law must be understood as insulating the state from such undesir­able
contingencies and leaving it free to invoke its sovereign attributes at any
time and at any stage of a judicial proceeding, under the principle that the
mistakes and omissions of its officers do not bind it.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It is my hope that with this
discussion as a start­ing point, this Court will soon adopt what in its opi­nion
is the most acceptable view and thereby establish a definite, clear and uniform
line of legal reasoning in cases of this, nature. I would have wanted to ask
the Court to do it in this case, but as there are so many pending cases
awaiting our attention, and after all, the result under any of these theories I
have ex­plained is the same and justifies the decisions I have referred to as
well as the others of similar import, I am satisfied with voicing my humble
personal observa­tions in this footnote. I will, announce my own conclu­sion as
to which of the three approaches is, in my view, correct, after the Court has
had full opportunity to fully deliberate on the matter, as then my conclusion
will carry with it the benefit of a full exchange of views with the rest of the
mem­bers of the Court who, I am sure, can give me all the light I need to
arrive at a correct position.</p>
