				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila,
in Civil Case No. 53457, dated September 30, 1964, as amended by its order
dated December 1 of the <span style="">same </span>year, ordering the defendants Manila Railroad Company and
Manila Port Service to <span style="">pay </span>to the plaintiff Fulton Insur­ance Company the amount of P4,701.20
representing the value of <span style="">Certain </span><span style="">lost </span>goods,
P500.00 by way of <span class="GramE">attorney's</span> fees, and costs - said
defendants assailing the decision and order aforementioned on grounds of
prescription and lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law questions involved are disclosed in the following resume
of the antecedent facts of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1961</st1:date>,
fifty-one cartons listing adding machines and three cartons advertising matters
were shipped by the <span class="SpellE">Vamco</span> Intercontinental, Ltd. at <st1:place><st1:city>San
  Francisco</st1:city>, <st1:state>California</st1:state></st1:place> thru the
SS President Grant to <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span> &amp; Company at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
as consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel arrived at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1961</st1:date>, and on the same day, discharged
the shipment un­to the custody of the Manila Railroad Company and Ma­nila Port
Service, <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="8">August
 30, 1961</st1:date>, the consignee filed a "provisional claim" for
damages against both the ship owners and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Manila Railroad Company
and Manila Port Service subsequently delivered the goods to the consignee, but
of the fifty-one cartons listing adding machines, only twenty-seven (27)
together with the three cartons advertising matter were actually re­ceived by
the <span class="SpellE">Marsman</span> &amp; Company on September 18, 1961; and
out of the twenty-four missing cartons, seven were later recovered by the
Manila Police Department, leav­ing seventeen cartons unaccounted for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As insurer of the shipment, the Fulton
Insurance Company paid to the consignee, the value of the lost listing adding
ma­chines, and was thereby subrogated to the rights of the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants having refused or failed to pay
the value of the lost goods, Fulton Insurance Com­pany commenced action in the
Court of First Instance of Manila on July 23, 1962, suing alternatively both
the carrier and the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operators for recovery
of P4<span class="GramE">,701.20</span> representing the value of the lost
listing adding machines and attorney's fees in the sum of P250.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged in the complaint among others,
that the loss of the seventeen cartons listing adding machines was due either
to the negligence of the ship­ping company or the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operators, the Manila Rail­road Company and Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case was <span style="">docketed </span><span style="">as No. </span><span style="">51017 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 31, 1963, the court dismissed the case as against the Manila
Railroad Company and Manila Port Service upon <span style="">a </span>"motion to dismiss" of said <span style="">defendants, </span>the court declaring itself without jurisdiction over
the subject-matter of the action because the amount claimed was less than
P5,000.00 which properly falls within the jurisdiction of the City Court of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration of
the order <span style="">filed
by the plaintiff having been denied, Fulton </span><span style="">In­</span><span style="">surance Company on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="3"><span style="">March 20, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, filed a new com­plaint
in the same court against the Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service,
reproducing the alle­gations made in the first case, except that the demand for
attorney's fees was increased from P250.00 to P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case was docketed </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">No. 53457 of the
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service
answered in due time denying all the material allegations of the complaint, at
the same time interposing a special defense that "the claim has be­come
time-barred and/or prescribed for the failure of the consignee or its
representative to file the claim <span style="">for </span><span style="">the value of the
cargoes allegedly lost </span><span style="">within </span><span style="">fifteen (15) </span><span style="">days from the date the last package was
discharge from the carrying vessel; and/or its failure to file suit within one
(1) year from said date of dis­charge."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
September 30, 1964, the trial court, after a joint hearing of the two cases,
rendered a decision, </span>dismissing the complaint <span style="">in </span>Civil Case No. 51017, absolving the
defendant American President Lines, Ltd. of any liability; but in Civil Case
No. 53457, ordered <span style="">the defendants
Manila </span><span style="">Railroad
Company and </span><span style="">Manila Port Service
to pay Fulton Insurance Company the sum of P500.00 plus the additional sum of
P500.00 as attorney's fees, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff received notice of the decision on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="10"><span style="">October
 7, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1964</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision without <span style="">setting </span>the same for hearing, which
was supplemented however, by <span style="">a </span>"motion to set", dated <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1964</st1:date>, setting the aforesaid motion <span style="">for reconsideration
for </span>hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="11">November 14,
 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants opposed the
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an <span style="">order dated</span> <st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="11">November <span style="">18, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the court denied </span>the motion declaring
itself without <span style="">jurisdiction to pass upon the same after </span>the 30-day period for
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon a motion <span style="">for reconsideration
</span>of this last <span style="">order, </span>the court, on December 1, 1964, amended the decision of
September 30, 1964, and ordered the defendants to <span style="">pay </span><span style="">to the plaintiff the
sum of P4,701.20 plus the additional sum of P500.00 </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">attorney's fees, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants </span><span style="">appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that the claim of Fulton Insurance Company <span style="">has
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">is </span>pointed
out that the goods in question were discharged from the carrying vessel on
August 25, 1961, while the com­plaint (Case No. 53457) was filed on March 20,
1963, or one year and seven months later; and since under Section 15 of the
Management Contract, it is provided<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“<span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in any event the CONTRACTOR (appellants herein) shall be
relieved and released of any and all responsibility or liability for loss,
damage, <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> and/or non-delivery of goods,
unless suit in the <u>court of proper jurisdiction</u> is brought within a pe<span style="">riod of one(1) year from the date of the
discharge of the goods", the action has become time-barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appel­lee</span> meets the
argument by maintaining that it actually complied with the requirement in the
said contract by filing Civil Case No. 51017 in the Court of First Instance of
Manila on July 23, 1962; that although the case was dismissed </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">against herein appellants, it subsequently filed Civil Case No. 53457
in the same court before the dismissal became final; and since the cases were
tried jointly, Civil Case No. 53457 should be considered </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">continuation of Civil Case No. 51017 and both cases deemed filed within
the required period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither contention is correct.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The Court of First Instance of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
is the court of proper jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may <span style="">not </span>be seriously debated
that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was right in suing herein appell­ants
and the American President Lines as alternative defendants under alternative
causes of action in the first case (No. 51017).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such procedure is expressly sanctioned by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prevailing rule is that a consignee, when
uncertain of the place and time of the loss or damage to its goods, may in one
case seek re­lief alternatively, against the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operators un­der <span style="">a </span>contract of deposit and the steamship company under <span style="">a </span>contract
of carriage by sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action calls for
the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction, which muni­cipal courts do not have,
and is within the original exclusive jurisdiction of courts of first instance;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and since Sec. 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court permits the <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of causes of action in the alternative, it follows that even if one of the
causes of action were within the exclusive jurisdiction of <span style="">a </span>lower
court by<span style=""> <span style="">reason </span>of the amount of the demand involved,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Court of First Instance of Manila has
jurisdiction <span style="">over </span>both.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of First Instance of <span style="">Manila is
the </span>court of proper jurisdiction contemplated in the Management Contract
aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, therefore,
should not have dismissed the case as against herein appellants although the
amount of the claim against them was less than P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The second case <span style="">(No.
53457) filed against herein appellants was </span>not time-barred, although it
may not legally be considered as a <span style="">continuation
of Civil Case No. </span>51017.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule
that the subsequent abandonment or dismissal of an action other than on the
merits, takes no time out of the period of <span style="">pres</span><span style="">cription,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is not applicable
to the case at bar by reason of the provisions of Article 1155 of the new </span><span style="">Civil Code which expressly provides that the <span style="">prescription of actions is interrupted when
they are filed be­fore the court.</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such interruption took place in </span>this
case when the first action was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila
which, <span style="">as </span>previously
pointed out above, was the court of <span style="">proper jurisdic­</span>tion contemplated in the Ma<span style="">nagement Contact,
taking </span>into consideration the allegations of the complaint filed in that
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That interruption lasted during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
until the order of <span style="">dis</span>missal for alleged lack of jurisdiction became final.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the discharge of the goods on August 25,
1961 to the filing of the complaint, Civil Case No. 51017, on July 23, 1962, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellee</span></span><span style=""> </span>then had
one (1) month and two (2) days left of the one-year prescriptive period
provided for in the Management Contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That <span style="">case </span><span style="">was dismiss­</span>ed as against herein appellants
on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1963</st1:date>; and on
<st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of
<span style="">dismissal
which</span> was de­nied on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="3">March 4,
 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record fails to
show when the plaintiff received notice of the order of denial of the
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, nonetheless,
that the plaintiff received notice thereof on the same date, that is, on <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1963</st1:date>, it had eight (8) days
left within which to perfect an appeal; but as no <span style="">appeal was </span>taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
the order of dismissal became final on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That date,
therefore, was the starting time when the period of prescription commenced to
run again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, from <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1963</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1963" day="20" month="3"><span style="">March 20, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, when </span>the
complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 63457 was filed, only eight days of the
more than one month left of the prescriptive period had again elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, therefore, the second action was not
time?<span style="">barred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are two <span class="GramE">school</span> of thoughts as to
the legal effect of the cessation of the interruption by an in­tervening action
upon the period of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is </span>the view expressed and perhaps,
not without reasons, <u>that the </u><u><span style="">full
period </span>of prescription should start </u><u><span style="">to </span>run anew</u>, reckoned from the date of the cessa­tion of the
interruption.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contrary view is, that the cessation of
the interruption merely <u>tolls the running</u><u><span style=""> of the </span></u><u><span style="">rema</span>ining
period of prescription</u>, <span style="">deducting </span>from
the full period thereof, the time that has already elapsed prior to the filing
of the <span style="">intervening
action.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Nevertheless,
all discussion on this point is academic; considered in the light of either
view, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the second action is not barred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellants maintain that the court be­low, acted without
jurisdiction in issuing the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="12">December
 1, 1964</st1:date>, amending the decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">It is </span>pointed out that
the plaintiff received notice of the decision on October 7, 1964, and, there­fore,
the period of appeal would expire on November 6, <span style="">1964; </span>that while it is true the plaintiff filed a mo­<span style="">tion </span>for reconsideration of the
decision of October 12, <span style="">1964, </span><span style="">however, as it did not contain a notice of
the date and place of hearing thereof, the motion for reconsideration did not
suspend the running of the period for </span><span style="">appeal; and when said motion was implemented by a "mo­tion to set”
dated November 11, 1964, setting it for hearing on November 14, 1964, the
period for appeal had already elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the court had no more <span class="GramE">jurisdic­tion</span> to </span><span style="">entertain the motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the </span>position
taken by the appellants on this particular point to be meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present provision of section 2 of Rule 37
construed in relation to sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court
provides that a written notice of a motion for new trial<span style=""> shall be served by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> on the adverse
party stating the time and place of the hearing thereof, and the court shall
not act upon the motion without proof of such notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said provision repealed the provision of
section 146 of the old Code of Civil Procedure and the rulings founded thereon,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to the effect that the notice must be served
by the court on the adverse party.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
notice therein required is now mandatory, and the failure of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to give notice of the time and place of hearing of
the motion it filed in the court below, was indeed fatal to its cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the case of Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity
Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Batu</span> Cons­</span><span style="">truction Co., et </span><span style="">al.,
L-16636, June 24, 1965, where appellants also failed to give notice of the time
and place of hearing of their motion for reconsideration in the trial court and
were practically in the very same position that herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is now situated, this </span><span style="">Court, speaking thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
resolved the </span><span style="">same points now
raised in this appeal as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appellants maintain that the motion was in reality one for
new trial under Rule 37, section 1, paragraph (c), and that pursuant to section
2 of the same Rule, they specifically pointed out the findings of the court
which they honestly believed to be contrary to law, making express reference to
the pertinent documentary evidence and legal provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sug­gestion is that when the motion is
upon that ground, the court may act upon it even if the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">mo­vant</span></span><span style=""> has not</span> set the same for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Rules, however, are quite clear on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of Rule 37, regarding <span style="">motion for new trial, requires that a written
notice thereof be served </span>by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> on the
ad­verse party, and this require­ment applies whichever of the grounds allowed
for such motion be relied upon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The written notice referred to evidently is that prescribed
for motions in general <span style="">by </span>Rule
15, Sections 4 and 5 (formerly Rule 26), which provide that such notice shall
state the time and place of hearing and shall be served upon all the parties
con­cerned at least three days in advance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And according to section 6 of the same Rule, no motion shall be acted
upon <span style="">by the court without </span>proof
of such notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed it has been held
that in such a case, the motion <span style="">is
nothing but </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">useless piece </span>of paper (Philip­pine National Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Donasco</span>, L­18638, February 28, 1963, citing <span class="SpellE">Manakil</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>, 42 Phil. 81;
Roman Catholic Bishop of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Unisan</span>, 44 Phil. 866; and Director of Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Sanz</span>, 45 Phil. 117).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason is <span style="">obvious: unless
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> sets the time </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">place of hearing, the court would have no way
to determine whether that party agrees to or objects to the motion, and if he
objects, to </span>hear him on his objection, since <span style="">the Rules themselves do not fix </span>any period within which he may
file his reply or opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are not impressed by the argument that the ‘supplement’
filed by the appellants on May 30 should be deemed retroactive as of the date
the motion for re­consideration was filed and therefore cured the defect
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To so consider it would be to
put a premium on negligence and subject <span style="">the
finality of judgments to the forgetfulness or whims of parties?</span>litigant
and their lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This of course would
be intolerable in a well-ordered judicial system."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And in the same manner that the
"supplement" to the mo­tion for reconsideration in the above-cited
case failed to cure the defect of said motion for reconsideration, We <span style="">also </span>cannot
subscribe to the contention of herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that
the failure to give notice of the time and place of hearing of its motion for
reconsideration was cured when it subsequently filed a motion to set it for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration
that failed to give the requisite notice of hearing, did not toll the running
of the period for appeal, and the said <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period naturally elapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision
of <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1964</st1:date>
therein sought to be reconsidered, had then become final when the subsequent
motion to set the same for hearing was filed on <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">We </span>have to declare,
therefore, that the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="12">December

Phil. 719, where We made the following observations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The statute of limitations contained in
the Code of Civil Procedure (Act 190) contains no specific or express provision
<span style="">on the suspension or interruption of
the </span>running of <span style="">the period of
prescription by the institution of an action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a firmly established rule in many American states that the
commencement of </span><span style="">the suit prior
to the expiration of the applicable limitation period interrupts the running of
the statute as </span><span style="">to </span>all <span style="">parties to the action (43 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., sec. 247, pp. </span>202- <span style="">203).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule is similar to
that contained in Art. <span class="GramE">1155 of the New Civil Code.</span>
This principle, however, </span>does <span style="">not
appear in Act No. 190, our old statute of </span>li<span style="">mitations</span><span style="">, x</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"; </span>See
also II Reyes &amp; <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, An <span style="">Out</span>line of Phil. Civil Law (1967), pp. 257-258, where this <span style="">comment appears: "<span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>
and Tribunal Supreme of </span><span style="">Spain </span><span style="">hold that the </span>filing of <span style="">the </span>action <span style="">interrupts the </span><span style="">pres</span>cription
of actions regardless of the results of the action (TS 4 Jan. 1901; 1<span style="">7 Dec. </span>1927; 8 Nov. 1948)."</p>
