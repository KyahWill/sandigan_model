an incompetent person, deprived of reason, and suffering from severe mental

<span class="SpellE">Malo­les</span>, a woman deprived of reason, against her

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused entered a plea of "not
guilty".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he stood
trial, at the close of which the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judgment

reaches the age of majority, to pay the costs and to suffer all the accessories
of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> has appealed from the
said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Six witnesses appear to have testified during the trial in the
court below in support of the People's cause, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, Adriano Villegas
and <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the prosecution tented to
show that sometime in the month of October, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> went to the farm owned by his grandfather (<span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pano</span>) in Barrio San Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, to cut
grass for his cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the middle of
that farm is the small hut of <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pano</span>, walled on four sides with bam­boo slats (bamboo split
into halves) set perpendicular to the ground, and roofed with galvanized iron
sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scarcely had <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> started cutting grass some distance from the
hut, when he heard the voice of a woman calling out for help which attracted
his attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> approached the
hut, leaving his scythe behind on the grass.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He looked into the hut through the holes in the southern walls, and saw
Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> on top of <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, in the act of coi­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diego's pants was-rolled down his knees,
while <span class="SpellE">Leonida's</span> dress was raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, however, was struggling, trying
to avoid the attack upon her honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
noticing <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno's</span>
presence, Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> stood and raised his pants,
then came out of the open door of the hut and approached <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Levelling</span> a gun at <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> warned and
threatened the former not to tell anybody what he saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> promised
not to tell to anybody about the mat­ter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he did not reveal to anybody the incident he saw until at the
preliminary investigation of the case, and when he was asked why he did not
report the matter to the father of the girl, he said that it was due to fear
that <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> might harm him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some five months later, on or about the 26th day of March, 1965,
Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> approached Adriano, Ville­gas, a tractor
operator, while the latter was plowing the farm of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> in Barrio San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, with a tractor, and inquired how
much it would cost him to have his land plowed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having been told that it would cost P20.00, <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>
pointed to the land to be plowed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Villegas plowed the land with his tractor at an agreed price of
P20.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing, however, that the land
belongs to his co-brother-in-law (<span class="SpellE">bilas</span>), <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, Adriano
Villegas became inquisitive, and asked Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>
why he had asked him to plow the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To his inquiry, Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> answered in the
following wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Alam</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">Ader</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">iyong</span> <span class="SpellE">isang</span> <span class="SpellE">anak</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span>
<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">sira-sira</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
bait ay <span class="SpellE">nidisgracia</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>, ay <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">balita</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>
<span class="SpellE">ngayon</span> ay <span class="SpellE">buntis</span>."
Adriano Villegas did not have the courage to inform the father of the victim
about the matter confided to him by Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>,
be­cause he feared that <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>
might take the law into his own hands, and also because he did not like to be
involved in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later,
however, he decided to reveal the confession of Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>
to his brother-in-law, Modesto <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, who was the
Barrio Captain of the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
then immediately went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> with Adriano Villegas and informed <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> about the outrage to his child; and thereafter,
the crime was reported to the local authorities of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1965</st1:date>, the
statement of Adriano Villegas was taken in the Of­fice of the Chief of Police
of the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later, <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> caused the
medical examination of his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>, Munici­pal
Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
who, on <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1965</st1:date>,
issued the following Medico-Legal Certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

the statements of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
and Adriano Villegas were taken during the first stage of the Preliminary
Investigation of the Complaint, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="4">April
 8, 1965</st1:date>, filed by <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, father of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due time, the case was elevated to the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, and the
Provincial Fiscal filed the corresponding Information, quoted in the opening
paragraph of this opinion, on May 25, 1965.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that at about the same time that the pro­ceedings in
the Office of the Chief of Police and the Muni­cipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> were being
had, <span class="SpellE">Venan­cio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> also

  Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <span class="SpellE">Man­daluyong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1965</st1:date>, Dr. Roberta S. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, a psychiatry specialist in the said hospital,
issued the following Medical Certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A):</p>

<blockquote>"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is to certify that Miss LEONIDA MALOLES, 17 years old, single,
a resident of San Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, had undergone psychiatric examination at the
Out-Patient Service of this hospital since <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Diagnosis: - Mental deficiency, severe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Remarks:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Her intellectual level is more or less
equivalent to that of a 2-4 years old child.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This certificate is issued at the request of Mrs. Martina <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, mother of the patient, for legal purposes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was established further that the victim, <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, may be classified as an idiot or partly
imbecile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could hardly give answers
to easy questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At her age of 17
then, she showed intelligence equivalent to that of a child 2-4 years old (<span class="SpellE">walang</span> <span class="SpellE">muang</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That mental condition had been since
childhood.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, the victim
of the dishonor complained of, gave birth to a baby girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was brought to court together with the child
which was ob­served by the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the witness stand, <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> confirmed the
fact that the child is hers, and that the father of her baby is Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his defense, Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> denied
all the de­clarations of the witnesses for the prosecution regarding his
alleged revelation to Adriano Villegas of the wrong he had committed upon the
honor of <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>,
and his supposed employment of force and intimidation upon her by pointing his
gun at her head in order to gain sex­ual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he knew the hut in the farm
of <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pano</span> referred to
by one of the witnesses for the prosecution, because he used to pass by that
place on his way going to his own hut in his "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>";
he denied ever having been in that hut (of <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pano</span>) much less with <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> although, by his own calculation, that hut is only
about 25 meters from the path he used to take in going to his farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted, however, that he and <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> were once seen
alone, but it was in his own hut in his "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>"
and not in the hut of <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pano</span>
which is far from his land; and it was the father of <span class="SpellE">Leo­nida</span>
who saw them and not <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>;
that, that incident took place in the month of March, 1965, and not in October,
1964, as testified to by <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>; on that particu­lar
occasion, he did not do anything wrong on <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Ma­loles</span> who had merely come to his own hut in his "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>" to ask for a glass of drinking water, and
barely two minutes after her arrival, her father came and found <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> there; <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> was then
seated inside the hut while he was busy cooking rice for lunch, and he was
really surprised why <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>
should make anything out of the inci­dent and get mad at him after that,
considering that the have been good farm neighbors long before by reason of the
fact that their "<span class="SpellE">kaingins</span>" adjoin each
other; on that occasion, <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> did not make any
outcry for help, and he did not poke any gun at the father when he came, much
less did he level any gun at <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> who was not there at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted, nevertheless, that <span class="SpellE">Venan­cio</span> did inquire from him why <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span>
was there inside his hut, and from his attitude then, he noticed that he (<span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>) was mad at him; that his (Diego's) own wife was
also there in his "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>", although, she
was then work­ing some 20 meters distant from the but.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span> also
revealed that he owns property worth about P45,000.00 in the locality.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful analysis of the evidence thus set forth, We are
convinced that the trial court did not err in convicting herein appellant of
the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the facts
relied upon in appellant's brief, We find that the issue hinges on the main
proposition - that the court below erred in giving faith and credence to the
testimonies of witnesses for the prosecution, and in dis­regarding the
testimonies of witnesses for the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">First and foremost, appellant assails the credibility of the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>,
the only witness for the prosecution who claimed to have seen herein appellant
actually commit the crime of rape of which he now stands convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant has pointed out the various
contradictions and inconsistencies in his testimony and now insists with
vehemence that his testimony should be disre­garded altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while We find the contradictions and
inconsistencies referred to in various portions of the testimony of this
witness, We cannot but be slow in accept­ing the theory of herein appellant not
only for the reason that We find his testimony on material points to be cre­dible,
but also because of the observations of the trial court relative to the
credibility of this witness which We are legally bound to respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the decision
appealed from reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The defense attacked the credi­bility of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, there are contradictions and
inconsistencies in his answer to the questions of the Court and the de­fense
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are also exagge­rations
but those exaggerations and contradictions are with respect to the nature of
how the accused committed the imputation, but there is no denial that whether
there was force or there was none the Court could believe the said witness that
he saw the accused enjoyed sexual intercourse with the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In a word, the lower court disregarded
portions of the testimony of this witness, but gave credence to the portions
thereof which it believed were consistent with the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And We find this to be legally sound, for our
own examina­tion of the testimony of this witness revealed that while he
appears to have made exaggerations and contradictions in portions of his
testimony, he stuck fast in and never wavered from his declaration that he saw
herein appellant with pants rolled down to his knees, on top of the victim who
was lying on her back with her dress raised to her waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this facts <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> testified with un­flinching consistency,
notwithstanding that the trial court appears to have flogged him with
derogatory remarks when­ever the court noticed any inconsistency in his
statements, even threatening him with imprisonment, at one instance, if he
would not tell the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
perfectly reasonable to believe the testimony of a witness with respect to some
facts and disbelieve it with respect to other facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
And it has been aptly said that even when witnesses are found to have
deliberately falsified in some material particulars, it is not required that
the whole of their uncor­roborated testimony be rejected, but such portions
thereof deemed worthy of belief may be credited.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Suffice it to say, in this connection, that a trial court, by reason of its
proximate contact with witnesses, are in a more compe­tent position to
discriminate between the true and the false,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and We really find no cogent reason to disturb the above-quoted conclusion of
the court below in the de­cision appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">But assuming, for the moment, that We should place the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> wholly
out of considera­tion, still We find enough evidence of record to sustain the
conviction of herein appellant as We shall hereinafter show.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other evidence tends to show, as testified to by Adriano Villegas
and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, that
the prosecu­tion of the case against herein appellant was commenced soon after
the commission of the crime was revealed to Villegas by herein appellant
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villegas testified that he
plowed the farm of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>
at the ins­tance of herein appellant, and this point appears to be <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> in the record, after which herein appel­lant
confided to said witness that he caused the said land to be plowed as an act of
gratitude or to appease <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>,
one of whose daughters he had ravished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such revelation, in point of time, is confirmed by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, that upon the
information of Villegas, he reported the matter to the authorities of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above all these, the stubborn fact stands out
in the record that the victim himself, <span class="SpellE">tho</span>
intellectually deficient, had positively and repeatedly pointed to herein
appellant during the trial of the case, as the father of her child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the con­clusion of the trial court in
this regard truly enlightening:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence submitted, there is no dispute that <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> had carnal
knowledge with somebody and out of that she be­came pregnant and ultimately
gave birth to a normal child on, <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="7">July
 4, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the trial,
she was noticed to be an idiot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
Roberta <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, resident physi­cian and
undisputedly a <span class="SpellE">phsychiatrist</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Mental Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> supporting that
observation of the Court testified and certified as shown in Exhibit
"A" that Miss <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>
during her examination of her mental condi­tion from <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1965</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1965</st1:date> was suffering a severe mental
deficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her intellect­ual level is
more or less equivalent to <st1:time minute="58" hour="15">two to four</st1:time>
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also testified that the
mental de­ficiency of <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>
was with her since birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Court, at
her first appearance, <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>
was then with her child and was observed to be looking up and down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her child was or­dered by the Court to
be held by her mother, she sat down and continued to look up and down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when the Court or the lawyers asked her
questions, she used to give sharp looks and made no answers except those that
could be answered by either yes or no through the nod of her head and similar
to a small child, she would point somebody if the question called for her to in­dicate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Majority of the questions propounded were not
answered by her and it took difficulties for her to make one but not through
her lips but through her finger and head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some of the queries are the follow­ing:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Question by the Court - Is that your child?" She answered in
the affirmative through the nod of her head and when the Court also asked her,
who was the father of said child, she pointed to the ac­cused <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
Court again asked her to approach the man whom she claimed to be the father of
her child, she went nearer the accused and indicated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Such revelation of the commission of the
crime by herein appellant, and his positive identification by the victim as the
father of her child are, to our mind, sufficient to convict herein appellant,
independently of the testi­mony of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, also assails the credibility of the testimony
of Adriano Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>,
father of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points to the
fact that the testimonies of these witnesses are, likewise, not free from
contradictions and inconsistencies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, such inconsistencies exist, but from our own examination of the
evidence, We found that they refer merely to minor details which do not detract
any substance from the value of their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such discrepancies - referring to trivial
facts as to whether it was Villegas or <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>
(Barrio Captain) who personally gave the information to the victim's father
about the dishonoring of his child by herein appellant; whether Villegas was
alone or was with the Barrio Captain when the said information was transmitted
to <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>;
whether or not the mother of the victim was present in the house when the
informa­tion referred to was given; whether the information was revealed to the
father of the victim sometime on March 29 or 30, 1965, or early in April of the
same year; whether it was at noon or in the afternoon when Villegas and/or the
Barrio Captain came to the house of the victim to give the information; whether
it was the father of the victim or the Barrio Captain who initiated the move to
report the commission of the crime to the local authori­ties of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>; whether <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> alone reported
the matter to the police of the place and had Villegas fetched afterwards, or <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span>, Villegas and the Barrio Captain went to town
altogether to make the report and whether the respective statements of said
witness­es were then and there taken by the police, or sometime thereafter -
may be overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is but natural
that different witnesses will vary in detail in their testi­monies about a
single past occurrence, unless they are first rehearsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than being indicia of falsehoods, such
inconsistencies reveal clear signs that the said witnesses had neither been
tutored nor trained, which may be taken as evidence of their good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor do We find any merit in the claim of
herein appellant, that because these witnesses are related to the victim, their
testimo­nies deserve no credence because they are necessarily biased, partial,
prejudiced and interested witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­lationship
to the victim alone does not impair the positive and clear testimony of
witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant decries further the reliance made by the court below
upon the identification of herein appellant by the victim as the father of her
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He capitalizes on an answer made by
the victim to a leading question of the defense counsel during the
cross-examination of said witness:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ATTY. ENDAYA:</p>

<blockquote>"P -
You pointed to the accused as the father of your child simply because somebody
has instructed you to point him as the father, am I right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"R -
Yes, sir." (Tan, Lunar, p.13)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Apparently, however, the victim, whose
intelligence has been conclusively proven to be equal to that of a 2 - 4 years
old child, did not understand the question; for in her second appearance in
court, having been present­ed later as a defense witness, she testified as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ENDAYA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. - When you revealed after having been called by
the Court and in answer to my question you stated that you were pointing to the
accused as the author of your pregnancy only because you had been so
instructed, my question is who instructed you to do so?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

else and not the accused, am I right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. -<span style=""> </span>So you were not telling the truth previously

<blockquote>That is all." (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leynes</span>,
pp. 28-30)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By and large, therefore, We find that the evidence for the
prosecution has convincingly shown herein appellant's guilt which, it would certainly
not be trite to add here, was never overcome by the evidence for the de­fense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, We find the answers of
here­in appellants to questions touching upon the acts im­puted to him
unresponsive and equivocal, if not evasive.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Finally, We are convinced of the correctness of the observation
of the trial court that monetary considera­tion, as a motive that might have
impelled the parents of the victim to charge herein appellant, must be ruled
out, for it has been convincingly shown that both appellant and the father of <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> own property of
substan­tial value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
significant to note that, any way, appellant had admitted that at one time, he
and <span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> were
found alone in the hut in his "<span class="SpellE">Kaingin</span>" by
the father of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maloles</span> was then five
months pregnant, and We are more inclined to believe that the victim must have
gone there for some purposes other than to secure drinking water as claimed by
Diego <span class="SpellE">Malillos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Added to this is the fact, also admitted by appel­lant, that there is no
known plausible reason why the witnesses for the prosecution should impute to
him the commission of such a heinous crime, from which the con­clusion may be
drawn that the charge must be true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sequently,
We find the decision of the lower court in accordance with the law and the
evidence, and the same must be upheld.</p>
