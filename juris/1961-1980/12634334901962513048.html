heirs of Juanito Mala­sarte, et al., obtained a favorable decision, dated Sep­tember
16, 1974, which, when appealed to the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del
Norte and later to the Court of Appeals, was sustained and affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the decision of the Court of Appeals
was elevated to this Court on <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, because of failure of
the petitioners to pay the required fees on time, the petition was
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the decision of the
Court of Appeals became final and exe­cutory, the Court of First Instance of
Zamboanga del Norte, Branch I, Dipolog City, upon application, issued a writ of
execution, dated March 4, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Writ

Librado Yebes to explain within seventy-two (72) hours (1) why he had not
served the writ of execution in the case or if he had served it, why no return
had been made; and (2) why it was necessary for him to get P200.00 from
complainant Leonarda Vda. de Malasarte and to ex­plain what he did with the
