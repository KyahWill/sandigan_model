R. No. 31169-R, the PHHC Board Resolution No. 550 was declared void and of no effect and the PHHC was enjoined to respect the said Conditional Contract to Sell and to eject any squatters on Lot No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> On June 6, 1964, the trial court granted the motion of the intervenors that they be allowed to adopt the affirma­tive defenses raised in the answer of respondent PHHC.&nbsp; Thereafter, a preliminary hearing on the said affirmative defenses was conducted as if a motion to dismiss had been filed, after which all the parties agreed to submit the in­cident for resolution of the court on the basis of the pleadings filed therein.&nbsp; </p><p> On the same date, June 6, 1964, the trial court issued an Order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, in the following tenor:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "Going over the records of the case, it appears that the lot in dispute in this case had been awarded to the in­tervenors and a deed of conditional contract to sell had been executed in their favor by the defendant.&nbsp; Plaintiff asks that the same lot be awarded to her basing her claim under Resolution No. 550 of the PHHC dated May 16, 1961.&nbsp; It also appears that a decision involving, more or less, the award of the parties to this case, was promulgated by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 31169-R, dated August 31, 1963, affirming the decision of the Court in Civil Case No. Q-5866 declaring null and void said Resolution No. 550 and which gave full force and effect to the award of the lot in favor of the intervenors.&nbsp; </p><p> "Resolving the issue raised, the Court believes that the complaint of the plaintiff states no cause of action.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals in the case of De Leon v.

No. 34870-R, affirming <em>en toto</em> the appealed Order of the trial court, thus:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> "* * *after taking up the ground 'That the complaint states no cause of action' dismissed the case on the said ground based on the following decision of this Court in CA-G.R.

No. 370 and to res­pect the award previously made in favor of De Leon and, pursuant thereto, passed and approved Resolution No. 430 which authorized the award of the lot in dispute to plaintiff De Leon.&nbsp; Making good its commitment, the PHHC on March 27, 1961, executed a conditional contract to sell the property to plaintiff Irene de Leon who, on the basis of that pre-trial agreement and the contract to sell thus executed in her favor by the PHHC, moved to dismiss Civil Case No. Q-5411 without prejudice, and fulfilled partly her obligation under the contract by paying several installments more.&nbsp; Without ob­jection on the part of either of the defendants therein, the case, as prayed for, was ordered dismissed without prejudice.&nbsp; </p><p> 'Shortly after the dismissal of Civil Case No. Q-5411, or on May 16, 1961, the Board again passed and approved Resolution No. 550 reconsidering altogether its commitments to plaintiff De Leon, totally disregarding the conditional contract to sell previously execu­ted, and re-awarding the subject property to Macabingkil.&nbsp; </p><p> 'Plaintiff Irene de Leon, assisted by her husband Vicente Llanes, instituted the present complaint for injunction with damages against the PHHC seeking, among others, to enjoin the latter, its officers, representatives, agents or persons acting for and in its behalf from implementing PHHC Board Resolution No. 550 dat­ed May 16, 1961, or from awarding or selling the lot in question to Concepcion Macabingkil or any other person or persons.&nbsp; </p><p> 'As its main defense, the PHHC contends, among others, that plaintiff De Leon was not qualified for nor entitled to the award, and that the conditional contract to sell was void.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

by declaring the PHHC Board Reso­lution No. 550 dated May 16, 1961, void and of no effect, enjoining the defendant corporation to respect the Conditional Contract to Sell it executed in favor of plaintiff Irene de Leon involving Lot 27, Block No. E-148 on March 27, 1961, and to eject any and all squatters on the said lot in question; by ordering the defend­ant to pay to plaintiffs the sum of P500.00 by way of moral and exemplary damages aside from the sum of P300.00 by way of attorney's fees; and for the def­endant to pay the costs.&nbsp; For lack of evidence, the court cannot grant the plaintiffs the amount of P10,000.00 which they claim as actual damages.'&nbsp; </p></blockquote></blockquote><p> A subsequent motion for reconsideration filed by defendant was denied.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> 'The case is now before us on appeal in­terposed by defendant PHHC on the bases of the following assignments of error:&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> 'But we are more concerned with the valid­ity of the evidence which the defendant intend­ed to present if its motion for postponement was granted.&nbsp; For, indeed, if the evidence sought to be presented is of such a character and nature and of sufficient weight and value as to probably alter the findings and conclu­sions of the trial court, we might not hesitate to sacrifice legal or technical inconvenience for substance by resending the case to the low­er court for the reception of the defendant's evidence, our findings and conclusions of the propriety of denial of defendant's action notwithstanding.&nbsp; The only evidence – it seems –­ which defendant PHHC seeks to present and upon which it bases its main defense, as can be ga­thered from their pleadings, arguments and af­fidavits attached to defendant's Rejoinder dat­ed March 30, 1962, tends to prove that the spouses plaintiffs De Leon and Llanes, had previously been awarded PHHC lots and that these lots were sold to others.&nbsp; From these, defend­ant would draw the conclusion that plaintiffs are engaged in speculative activities and, therefore, are disqualified from acquiring a lot from the PHHC.&nbsp; </p><p> 'These are matters already made and ap­pearing of record, both testimonial and documentary.&nbsp; That the plaintiffs had previously ac­quired PHHC lots and that some of which had been sold to others were admitted by Llanes, the lone witness.&nbsp; In fact, these transactions were shown by PHHC records and documents submitted in evidence the genuineness of which were admitted by defendant.&nbsp; It was likewise shown from the PHHC records, not denied by def­endant, that the PHHC itself had approved the previous awards and/or sales in favor of Llanes and De Leon and their subsequent transfers to other parties.&nbsp; But do these transactions, by themselves, necessarily show speculative acti­vities on the part of the spouses?&nbsp; We do not think so.&nbsp; But even if they do, we believe that upon them can not be predicated any right for the PHHC to rescind the consummated and partly fulfilled conditional contract to sell in favor of De Leon.&nbsp; While that ground may have been a valid and legitimate one for purposes of deny­ing approval of an application for award, it ceases to be so after the merits of the appli­cation had been duly passed upon and approved, the formal contract duly executed, and the par­ties, pursuant thereto, had partly fulfilled the obligation under it, by paying several ins­tallments as in this case, unless valid grounds exist to vitiate the contract.&nbsp; Contrary to defendant's contention, there was no misrepre­sentation or pretense made by the plaintiff De Leon in her application for an award because her own application bears the admission that her husband Llanes was a holder of a PHHC lot.&nbsp; From the moment of perfection of the contract there accrued in favor of DeLeon certain rights of which she can only be denied and deprived in accordance with and on the grounds provided for by law.&nbsp; </p><p> 'The defendant also contends that the award of the lot in question to plaintiff De Leon was in violation of the policy of the law creating the PHHC which enunciates that the homes should be for the homeless.&nbsp; Arguing, de­fense counsel says that the violation was against a public policy and therefore the con­ditional contract to sell was void.&nbsp; We do not agree that there was any violation of public policy.&nbsp; If anything has been violated at all the same is merely a rule or regulation of the PHHC which does not affect the obligation of a contract.&nbsp; But while the award in her favor may appear to be contrary to certain rules and reg­ulations of the PHHC for the reason that at the time she applied for the lot in question plain­tiffs have had previous awards of acquisitions of PHHC lots, it does not square with reason to prejudice the latter for the defendant's own acts in approving her application as well as the previous ones.&nbsp; It perforce will appear, that it was the PHHC that had caused, if not the doer of, the violation.&nbsp; </p><p> 'Furthermore, it is our understanding of the law that once a contract has been perfected, and more so if the same had already been partly complied with, the authority to annul it does not rest exclusively upon one of the parties.&nbsp; The matter must have to be submitted to the courts for adjudication.&nbsp; </p><p> 'There is another point to consider.&nbsp; From the PHHC records submitted in evidence, not denied by the parties, we find that another PHHC Lot 15, Block E-121 was previously offered, if not actually awarded to Macabingkil, which lot the latter wanted to have it exchanged with the disputed Lot 27, Block E-148 on which she was squatting.&nbsp; The refusal of De Leon to accept the exchange after her application was approved, had motivated the PHHC to propose a compromise solution whereby to De Leon would be awarded Lot No. 15 and to Macabingkil Lot No. 27, but the former had refused.&nbsp; (pp. 53-54, Rec.).&nbsp; If this is true, as the defendant corporation wishes us to believe, then the defendant's theory that De Leon was disqualified to an award of another PHHC lot becomes untenable.&nbsp; If she was disqualified, why was the offer of ano­ther lot made to her as a means of settling the tug-of-war over the disputed Lot No. 27 by and between De Leon and Macabingkil?&nbsp; We find as rather inconsistent the position taken by the defendant's counsel.&nbsp; </p><p> 'Again, defendant claims that when the PHHC awarded the lot in question to De Leon and subsequently executed the contract to sell in her favor, it was not aware of the speculative activities of De Leon.&nbsp; This claim does vio­lence to what appears in the record and to def­endant's own arguments in the brief.&nbsp; The evid­ence discloses that long before the conditional contract to sell was executed, the PHHC had already made investigations of the status and qualifications of De Leon to acquire a lot from the PHHC, because of the complaint or protest filed by Macabingkil with it and with the Office of Economic Coordination (OEC).&nbsp; It will thus appear that the PHHC was not without know­ledge of the disqualifications, if any, of plaintiffs to acquire the lot in question, and yet it proceeded to execute the conditional contract to sell.&nbsp; </p><p> 'We rule, therefore, in favor of the con­ditional contract to sell which must be given full force and effect.&nbsp; </p><p> 'Assigned Error No. 4 need not be dis­cussed in view of our findings and conclusions.&nbsp; </p><p> 'The attorney's fees awarded by the court <em>a quo</em> should be increased to P500.00.&nbsp; </p><p> 'WHEREFORE, except as modified with respect to attorney's fees, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed in all respects.'&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p align="center"> * * *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Gat­maitan in the Resolution of the Court of Appeals of August 14, 1968, thus:&nbsp; "on the back of page 59 rollo, it is seen that counsel for plaintiff (Macabingkil) received copy of the decision on 8 March 1968, therefore, his last day to file motion for reconsideration was 23 March, but as it was filed on March 25, page 77, therefore it was too late, and judgment had already become final",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; and this fact of receipt on March 8, 1968 by Macabingkil's counsel was also confirmed by the certification dated October 12, 1968 of the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, Jose A. Aguiling,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and by the Registry Return Receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; These provisions of the Rules of Court prescribing the time within which cer­tain acts must be done, or certain proceedings taken, are considered absolutely indispensable to the prevention of needless delays and to the orderly and speedy discharge of judicial businesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The time can be extended only if a motion for extension is filed within the time or period provided therefor.&nbsp; In the case at bar, no motion for ex­tension was ever filed by petitioner Macabingkil before March 23, 1968, and, as such, the said decision of March 1, 1968 has already become final and executory.&nbsp; To reiterate, perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is not only mandatory but jurisdictional, and failure to perfect an appeal as required by the Rules has the effect of rendering the judgment final and executory.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><strong> II</strong>&nbsp; </p><p> Viewing, however, the present petition as a special civil action for <em>certiorari</em>&nbsp; under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, in which case petitioner need not comply with the provisions of Rule 45 of the Rules, nevertheless, petitioner must comply with the requirements called for by such special civil action.&nbsp; It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that the Court of Appeals, in promulgating the de­cision in question, acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; For the of­fice of the writ of <em>certiorari</em> has been reduced to the cor­rection of defects in jurisdiction solely and cannot legally be used for any other purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; It is not intended to correct errors of procedure or mistakes in the judge's findings or conclusions.&nbsp; The only issue that confronts Us for determination, therefore, is – whether or not the Court of Appeals acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Concededly, the Appellate Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the act­ion.&nbsp; The only question, therefore, is – whether the Appel­late Court gravely abused its discretion in affirming the trial court's Order of dismissal of petitioner's action "for failure of complaint to state a cause of action".&nbsp; </p><p> There is no question that in the afore-mentioned Civil Case No. Q-5866, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on August 31, 1963 in CA-G. R. No. 31169-R, the Appellate Court found as fully established by the evidence that Irene de Leon, not Concepcion Macabingkil, is the rightful awardee from the PHHC of Lot No. 27, Block E-148, East Avenue Sub­division, Quezon City.&nbsp; Said Court found that De Leon's application to purchase said lot was duly processed and ap­proved by the PHHC after it had determined that the afore­mentioned applicant was qualified to purchase the said pro­perty under the existing law.&nbsp; As a consequence, a contract of sale was duly executed on March 27, 1961 by the PHHC in favor of Irene de Leon and, pursuant thereto, the latter, complying with her obligations as vendee under said con­tract, paid to the PHHC the required installments.&nbsp; </p><p> It is also undisputed that PHHC Board Resolution No. 550, which is the basis of petitioner's cause of action in the case at bar, was declared by the Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. No. 31169-R as void and of no legal effect because it was proven that there was no misrepresentation in the application of Irene de Leon.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the PHHC conducted an investigation on the status and qualifications of Irene de Leon to acquire the lot in question because of the protest filed by Macabingkil with the PHHC and with the Office of the Economic Coordination.&nbsp; On the basis of its factual findings, the Appellate Court concluded that the purported factual basis of Resolution No. 550, which can­celled the contract of sale in favor of Irene de Leon, did not exist.&nbsp; It was also found by said Court as undisputed in the record that "another PHHC Lot No. 15, Block E-121 was previously offered, if not actually awarded, to Macabingkil, which lot the latter wanted to have it exchanged with the disputed Lot No. 27, E-148, on which she was squat­ting." The refusal of De Leon to accept the exchange after her application was approved, had motivated the PHHC to pro­pose a compromise solution awarding to De Leon Lot No. 15 and to Macabingkil Lot No. 27, which the former had re­fused.&nbsp; </p><p> The decision dated August 31, 1963 of the Court of Ap­peals in CA-G. R. No. 31169-R, which affirmed the decision dated February 21, 1962 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City Branch V, in Civil Case No. Q-5866, "dec­laring the PHHC Board Resolution No. 550 dated May 16, 1961, void and of no effect", and "enjoining the defendant corpo­ration to respect the Conditional Contract to Sell it exec­uted in favor of plaintiff Irene de Leon involving Lot 27, Block E-148 on March 27, 1961, and to eject any and all squatters on the said lot in question", had already become final and executory before petitioner Concepcion Macabing­kil filed the case at bar, Civil Case No. Q-7832, on Feb­ruary 21, 1964, with the same Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City Branch V.&nbsp; The rule is well-settled that once a court renders a final judgment, all the issues bet­ween or among the parties before it are deemed resolved and its judicial functions as regards only matter related to the controversy litigated comes to an end,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and the same cannot be relitigated on its merits in the lower court as well as in the appellate courts.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "When an appellate court has once declared the law in a case, such declaration continues to be the law of that case even on a subsequent appeal.&nbsp; Such a rule is necessary to enable an appellate court to perform its duties satis­factorily and efficiently, and as a matter of policy in or­der to end litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> "Public policy and sound practice demand that, at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final at some definite date fixed by law.&nbsp; The very object for which courts were instituted was to put an end to con­troversies.&nbsp; To fulfill this purpose and to do so speedily, certain time limits, more or less arbitrary, have to be set up to spur on the slothful."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p></blockquote>Petitioner, however, insists that since she was not a party in CA-G. R. No. 31169-R, the judgment thereon, which affirmed that of the trial court in Civil Case No. Q-5866, is not final and binding as to her.&nbsp; This point has been answered by Associate Justice Magno S. Gatmaitan in his concurring opinion in the Resolution of the Court of Appeals of August 14, 1968, denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration in CA-G.R. No. 34870-R.&nbsp; While it is true that the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-5866 could not be enforced against Macabingkil, she not being a party therein, it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-5866 was "without any value at all" for the said judgment was binding upon the PHHC which was a party therein and its privies.&nbsp; It must be noted that the subject matter of that case was the same land that appel­lant now claims, and since the judgment therein declared void and of no effect PHHC Board Resolution No. 550, dated May 16, 1961, which is the basis of the claim of Macabing­kil, and compelled PHHC to abide by its commitment to sell said lot to De Leon that judgment consequently disabled PHHC from disposing again the same property in favor of pe­titioner.&nbsp; The only recourse of Macabingkil was, therefore, to have secured a declaration of nullity of the afore-men­tioned judgment, not in a collateral manner, as she attempts to do in the present proceedings, but by a direct action to annul the same.&nbsp; <blockquote><p> "Under our rules of procedure, the validity of a judgment or order of the court, which has become final and executory, may be attacked only by a direct action or pro­ceeding to annul the same, or by motion in another case if, in the latter case, the court had no jurisdiction to enter the order or pronounce the judgment (section 44, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court).&nbsp; The first proceeding is a direct at­tack against the order or judgment, because it is not inci­dental to, but is the main object of, the proceeding.&nbsp; The other one is the collateral attack, in which the purpose of the proceedings is to obtain some relief, other than the vacation or setting aside of the judgment, and the attack is only an incident.&nbsp; (I Freeman on Judgments, sec. 306, pages 607-608.) A third manner is by a petition for relief from the judgment or order as authorized by the statutes or by the rules, such as those expressly provided in Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, but in this case it is to be noted that the relief is granted by express statutory authority in the same action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was entered.&nbsp; * * *"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; </p></blockquote>Under existing rules, there are three (3) ways by which a final and executory judgment may be set aside.&nbsp; The first is by petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court, when judgment has been taken against the party through fraud, accident, mistake or excu­sable negligence, in which case the petition must be filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, but not more than six (6) months after such judgment was entered.&nbsp; The second is by direct action to annul and enjoin the enforcement of the judgment.&nbsp; This remedy presupposes that the challenged judgment is not void upon its face, but is entirely regular in form, and the alleged defect is one which is not apparent upon its face or from the recitals contained in the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> As explained in <em>Banco Español-Filipino v. Palanca,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; "under accepted principles of law and practice, long recognized in American courts, the proper remedy in such case, after the time for appeal or review has passed, is for the aggrieved party to bring an action enjoining the judgment, if not already car­ried into effect; or if the property has already been dis­posed of, he may institute suit to recover it." The third is either a direct action, as <em>certiorari</em>, or by a collate­ral attack against the challenged judgment or order.&nbsp; This remedy presupposes that the challenged judgment is void upon its face, or that the nullity of the judgment is apparent by virtue of its own recitals.&nbsp; As aptly explained by Justice Malcolm in his dissent in <em>Banco Español-Filipino v. Palanca</em>, <em>supra</em>, "A judgment which is void upon its face, and which requires only an inspection of the judgment roll to demonstrate its want of vitality is a dead limb upon the judicial tree, which should be lopped off, if the power so to do exists." &nbsp; <p> Since the afore-mentioned decision in Civil Case No. Q-5866 is not void upon its face, it may only be annulled by direct action on the ground of fraud.&nbsp; </p><p> It is only <em>extrinsic</em> or <em>collateral</em> fraud, as disting­uished from intrinsic fraud, however, that can serve as a basis for the annulment of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Fraud has been regarded as extrinsic or collateral, within the meaning of the rule, "where it is one the effect of which prevents a party from having a trial, or real contest, or from presenting all of his case to the court, or where it operates upon matters pertaining, not to the judgment itself, but to the manner in which it was procured so that there is not a fair submission of the controversy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, extrin­sic fraud refers to any fraudulent act of the prevailing party in the litigation which is committed outside of the trial of the case, whereby the defeated party has been pre­vented from exhibiting fully his side of the case, by fraud or deception practiced on him by his opponent.&nbsp; This was explained by Justice Miller, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "But there is an admitted exception to this general rule, in cases where, by reason of something done by the successful party to a suit, there was, in fact, no adversary trial or decision of the issue in the case.&nbsp; Where the unsuccessful party has been prevented from exhibiting fully his case, by fraud or deception practiced on him by his op­ponent, as by keeping him away from court, a false promise of a compromise; or where the defendant never had knowledge of the suit, being kept in ignorance by the acts of the plaintiff; or where an attorney fraudulently or without authority assumes to represent a party and connives at his defeat; or where the attorney regularly employed corruptly sells out his client's interest to the other side – these, and similar cases which show that there has never been a real contest in the trial or hearing of the case, are rea­sons for which a new suit may be sustained to set aside and annul the former judgment or decree, and open the case for a new and a fair hearing.&nbsp; See, Wells, Res Adjudicata, sec. 499; Pearce v. Olney, 20 Conn., 544; Wierich v. De Zoya, 7 Ill., (2 Gilm.) 385; Kent v. Ricards, 3 Md. Ch., 396; Smith v. Lowry, 1 Johns. Ch., 320; De Louis v. Meek, 2 Green (Iowa), 55.&nbsp; </p><p> "In all these cases and many others which have been examined, relief has been granted on the ground that, by some fraud practiced directly upon the party seeking relief against the judgment or decree, that party has been preven­ted from presenting all of his case to the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; </p></blockquote>Petitioner does not pretend, however, that she had been prevented from exhibiting fully her case in Civil Case No. Q-5866, by means of fraud or deception practiced on her by her opponent.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is worthwhile to note that, as a matter of fact, she had all the opportunity to present fully her side of the case.&nbsp; Thus, in her "Motion for Leave to Intervene", dated September 2, 1961 and filed in said Civil Case No. Q-5866, petitioner Macabingkil prayed therein that she "be allowed to intervene in the above-entitled case, by joining with the defendant (PHHC) in ans­wering the complaint and against the latter through a cross complaint", thereby implying that petitioner had a common defense with PHHC.&nbsp; Petitioner's motion for intervention was, however, denied on September 9, 1961 by the trial court after hearing for the case had "already been partially tried and was not anymore within the pleading period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Although petitioner appeared to have a direct interest in the subject matter of the litigation, said party did not seek a reconsideration of said order, much less did she question on appeal the validity of said order.&nbsp; On the basis of the foregoing, it is evident that even if we were to consider the present appeal as a petition for <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, still the said petition could not be granted. &nbsp; <p align="center"><strong> III</strong>&nbsp; </p><p> Even on equitable grounds, the contention of petitioner cannot be sustained.&nbsp; It should be recalled that in Civil Case No. Q-5411,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; which was filed by Irene de Leon against the PHHC and Concepcion Macabingkil and others, to compel the PHHC to execute the contract of sale of Lot No. 27 in her favor and to enjoin the PHHC from selling said lot to Macabingkil, several pre-trial conferences were held by the parties in order to reach an amicable settlement.&nbsp; It should be noted that Macabingkil, in her answer in the case, claimed the right to be awarded Lot No. 27 because of Resolution No. 370.&nbsp; As a result of such conferences, the members of the Board of Directors of the PHHC agreed to rescind Resolution No. 370, dated December 18, 1959, which annulled the original award of Lot No. 27 to Irene de Leon in 1957, and to re-award Lot No. 27 to Concepcion Macabingkil and Lot No. 15 to Irene de Leon.&nbsp; On March 21, 1961, the PHHC Board passed Resolution No. 430, reconsidering the aforesaid Resolution No. 370 and maintained the original award of Lot No. 27 in favor of Irene de Leon and Lot No. 15 in favor of Concepcion Macabingkil, and ordered Maca­bingkil to transfer whatever improvements she may presently have on Lot No. 27 to Lot No. 15.&nbsp; On March 27, 1961, the PHHC executed a "Conditional Contract to Sell" Lot No. 27 in favor of Irene de Leon.&nbsp; Pursuant to this contract, Irene de Leon paid to the PHHC her monthly installments corresponding to the months of April through and including August, 1961.&nbsp; On the basis of the foregoing compromise agreement, Irene de Leon filed, on April 22, 1961, a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-5411.&nbsp; Copies of this motion were furnished to all the parties, including the counsel of Concepcion Macabingkil.&nbsp; At the hearing of the motion on April 25, 1961, the counsel of Macabingkil was granted five (5) days, or until April 28, 1961, to file his opposition, if any, to the motion.&nbsp; On May 10, 1961, the trial court, upon finding that "no opposition was filed by the defendants, notwithstanding the fact that they were given time to do so", dismissed Civil Case No. Q-5411, with prejudice.&nbsp; It is evident that petitioner Macabingkil must have ac­quiesced in this compromise, since she did not question therein this settlement of the case by the re-awarding of Lot No. 27 to Irene de Leon and the execution of the sales agreement of said lot by the PHHC on March 27, 1961, but on the con­trary accepted the re-award to her of Lot No. 15, Block E­121, and continued with her purchase agreement with the PHHC over said property.&nbsp; A party cannot, in law and in good conscience, be allowed to reap the fruits of a compromise and repudiate what does not suit her.&nbsp; </p><p><strong> WHEREFORE</strong> , the present appeal should be, as it is here­by, <strong>DISMISSED</strong>, with costs against plaintiff-appellant Concepcion Macabingkil.&nbsp;
