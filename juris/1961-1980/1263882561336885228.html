of Unit Chief and Referee Felicito D.

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a workmen's compensation claim (p. 98, WCC rec.) against
respondent Victorias Milling Company, Inc., with the Department of Labor,
Sub-Regional Office No. VII, <st1:place><st1:placename>Bacolod</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1975</st1:date>,
the sub-regional office decided in favor of petitioner (Annex "A",
pp. <span style="">15-16, </span>rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent Victorias Milling Company, Inc. filed a motion for reconsideration
and/or petition for review, which was denied on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1975</st1:date> by the Unit Chief and Referee who elevated
the case to the Workmen's Compensation Commission (p. 9, WCC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 26, 1975, respondent Workmen's Compensation
Commission reversed the decision of the Unit Chief and Referee, absolving
respondent Victorias Milling Company, Inc. from any liability under the
Workmen's Compensation Act (Annex "B" of Petition, pp. 18-19, rollo),
anchoring its action on the observation and opinion of the Department of Labor
Compensation Rating Medical Officer who stated that "gout is an inborn error
of metabolism, and the duodenal ulcer was induced by the anti-gout medication
taken by the claimant and wherefore nature of employment has no
service-connection."</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission should be
set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Victorias Milling Company, Inc. admits that claimant
rose from the ranks since he joined the company on <st1:date year="1947" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From a mere remelter centrifugal in the Boiling House Department, <span style="">he rose to the position of evaporator tender,
pan man, evaporator capataz, relief foreman, regular foreman, until he became
boiling house technician on November 1, 1968 up to the time of his retirement
on December 31, 1973, due to intractable propyloric ulcer and gouty arthritis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In awarding his claim for compensation benefits in the amount of
Six Thousand (P6,000.00) Pesos and the reimbursement of medical expenses
amounting to Fourteen thousand nine hundred eight and 71/100 Pesos
(P14,908.71), the Unit Chief and Referee found that the "gouty arthritis
and duodenal ulcer" suffered by claimant while in the employ of respondent
Victorias Milling Company, Inc. is compensable, stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
extraordinary exertion in the performance of his work would naturally result in
the disease which he suffered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stress of work and the position that he ultimately occupied as foreman of such
a big company in the <span style="">boiling house
where the manufacture of </span>sugar is done would ultimately lead not only to
the gouty arthritis but also to the attack of ulcer which, according to the
doctors, was brought about by the drugs that he was taking to counteract the
arthritis, but if I may add it may also be due to the stress of the work and
the position he occupied as foreman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
all the treatment of the claimant, he spent a total of P14,908.71.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the first operation was
performed <span style="">at the respondent's hospital
but the expenses were charged to him and were deducted from his salary and
later on the expenses for his operation in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> were deducted from his retirement
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above amount was supported
by receipts which are attached to the records of this case"(pp. 15-16,
rollo).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that respondent Victorias Milling Company, Inc.
never controverted claimant's allegations that after liberation, the employees
were subjected to medical examination by the company every year; that he was
found well until 1966 when, due to the nature of his work and the conditions of
the working place in the boiling house where the temperature is quite <span style="">warm, he began to suffer gouty arthritis
which attacked his right shoulder, and later affected also his left shoulder;
that he had to exert physical effort while actually operating the old
centrifugal basket; that sometimes he could not eat his meals on time; that in
1966 he was operated on for ulcer because of the reaction of the arthritis
drugs that he was taking; that after the operation, he went back to work as
boiling house technician but still in the same place where the working
condition is so injurious to his health that his gouty arthritis continued
until he had to retire ultimately in 1973 because of physical disability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that claimant-petitioner was instructed to
submit to medical examination by Dr. Antonio M. Habana, Compensation Rating
Medical Officer of the Department of Labor, Sub-Regional Office No. VII,
Bacolod City, who found him with rheumatoid arthritis of the right shoulder
joint, affecting the right extremity; that there was a recurrence of duodenal
ulcer secondary to anti-gout drug; that the blood pressure was high and did not
go down to normal level even at rest and after a long period of treatment; that
his illness had greatly affected his ordinary physical activity that rendered
him unfit for service; and that his disability evaluation was 50% N.S.D.
(Section 18) [p<span style="">. </span>90, WCC rec.].</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, petitioner's claim is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has in no uncertain terms
pronounced in the many cases brought before It that there is a statutory
presumption of compensability so that the burden is on the employer to
establish by substantial evidence that the illness was not in fact aggravated
by the nature of the job (National Shipyards &amp; Steel Corp. vs. WCC, <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="1">Jan. 31, 1967</st1:date>, No. L-22628; National

Milling Company has proven by substantial evidence that the illness of the
petitioner could have arisen out of factors other than the nature of his
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the yearly
examination of its employees conducted by respondent company evinces that
petitioner was physically and mentally agile to perform the duties of his
position until he was operated on for ulcer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even after the operation he went back to work as boiling house
technician but still working in the same place where the working condition was
deleterious to health as his gouty arthritis continued until he ultimately
retired in 1973 at the early age of fifty-five (55) when a man normally is
still in the prime of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the
stance taken by respondent must perforce fail considering that it only relied
on the opinion of the Compensation Rating Medical Officer who even then was not
categorical in her findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
well-settled that once it is shown that the illness supervened during the
employment, as in this case, there is the legal presumption that the illness
arose out of or was aggravated by the employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, having failed to rebut the
presumption of compensability, should satisfy petitioner's claim.</p>
