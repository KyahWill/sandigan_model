				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the complaint in original case G. R. No.
L-28202, entitled "F. E. F. <span class="SpellE">Remotigue</span>, et al. v.
Hon. Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr.," and of the answer
filed by the defendant therein, as well as the arguments adduced by the parties
at the hearing held on <st1:date year="1957" day="6" month="11">November 6<span class="GramE">,1957</span></st1:date>, and the memorandum filed by the plain­tiffs,
and it appearing:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. That the main issue raised by the pleadings is the
qualification of defendant Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr. to be a
candidate for the office of City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City
in the general elections to be held on November 14, 1967;</p>

<p class="BODY">2. That it is the stand of the plaintiffs that de­fendant Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr. is not qualified to run for the office of City
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City because he filed his certificate
of candidacy for the office of City Mayor without first having resigned from
his office as Senator, in violation of Section 9 of the Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9 - GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS OF ELECTIVE OFFICIALS - In
addition to any special qualifications prescribed by this Charter, all elective
officers of the City shall be qualified and registered voter of the City, and
shall hold no other public office except that of notary public or membership in
the armed forces reserve, nor any other employment with the city or with the
National Government or any pro­vince or municipality.";</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">3. That the plaintiffs claim that the candidacy of defendant
Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr. is prejudicial to their interests
and to the interests of the persons they represent;</p>

<p class="BODY">4. That in the complaint - which is captioned as "For
Injunction and Declaratory Relief" - the plaintiffs pray this Court to
declare defendant Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr. disqualified to
run for the office of City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and to
declare his certificate of candidacy ille­gal, null and void and without force
and effect, and al­so to restrain him from running as City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and from resigning from his office as Senator;</p>

<p class="BODY">5. That the determination, in this case, of the issue thus raised
by the plaintiffs would amount to a declaratory judgment and a judgment in an
original act­ion for injunction, which are matters that are not with­in the
original exclusive jurisdiction of this Court;</p>

<p class="BODY">6. That neither would the allegations in the complaint warrant
the treatment of the action brought here­in as one for a petition for
certiorari or prohibition, or any other action that is within the original and
ex­clusive jurisdiction of this Court;</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court RESOLVED that the herein complaint of plaintiffs be, as
it is hereby, DISMISSED, with costs against the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
