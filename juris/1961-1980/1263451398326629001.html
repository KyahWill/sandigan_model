- to whom the amount aforesaid was paid - was not and could not be considered
as a non-resident alien <u>not</u> engaged in trade or business in the
Philippines within the purview of the tax code; thirdly, in finding that when
the payments in question were made to, and accepted by Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
the latter, as Vice-President of the Jai Alai, was but an extension of the
latter's personality, and finally, in not holding that the right to recover
said withholding tax from the Jai Alai had already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the Court of Tax Appeals dismissed, as against the now
deceased Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, the two causes of action alleged
in the complaint filed by the Republic, it appears from the errors assigned in
the latter’s brief in G.R. No. L-17462 that it questions only that portion of
the appealed decision which disposes of the second cause of action where it
seeks to hold <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> and the Jai Alai jointly and
severally liable as withholding agents for the withholding tax due on the
income received by <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> for the years 1947 and
1948.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal, therefore, does not
cover that portion of the aforesaid decision dismissing the first cause of action
which was for the recovery from Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> alone of
the amount of P73<span class="GramE">,522.62</span> representing <span class="SpellE">Assadourian’s</span> alleged income tax liability for the year
1946, computed as of <st1:date year="1951" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1951</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated further that the Republic sued <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> in relation to both causes of action either as
guarantor of <span class="SpellE">Assadourian’s</span> tax liability, or as the
latter's attorney-in-fact with the obligation to file his income tax returns
and pay or compromise the tax due on his income, or - inferentially at least -
in his personal capacity as he became personally liable because of his failure
to withhold the tax due on the income of <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having thus limited and clarified the true issue before Us, We
now proceed to consider the claim of Jai Alai (and also of <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>
was not and could not be considered as a non-resident alien <u>not engaged</u>
in trade or business in the Philippines within the purview of Section 53(b) of
the National Internal Revenue Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(b) Nonresident aliens.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- All persons, corporations and general
co-partnerships (<span class="SpellE">companias</span> <span class="SpellE">colectivas</span>),
in whatever capacity acting, including lessees or mortgagors of real property,
trustees acting in any trust capacity, executors, administrators, receivers,
conservators, fiduciaries, employers, and all officers and employees of the
Government of the Philippines having the control, receipt, custody, disposal,
or payment of interest, dividends, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities,
compensation, remunerations, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable annual
or periodical gains, profits, and income of any nonresident alien individual,
not engaged in trade or business within the Philippines therein, shall (except
in the cases provided for in subsection (a) of this section) deduct and
withhold from such annual or periodical gains, profits, and income a tax equal
to twenty per centum thereof:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided,
That no such deduction or withholding shall be required in the case of
dividends paid by a foreign corporation unless (1) such corporation is engaged
in trade or business within the Philippines and (2) more than eighty-five per
centum of the gross income of such corporation for the three-year period ending
with the close of its taxable year preceding the declaration of such dividends
(or for such part of such period as the corporation has been in existence) was
derived from sources within the Philippines as determined under the provisions
of section thirty-seven:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, Further,
That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may authorize such tax to be deducted
and withheld from the interest upon any securities the owner of which are not
known to the withholding agent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As is obvious, the above contention is decisive upon <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> and Jai Alai's liability as withholding agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it true that <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>
was not and could not be considered as a nonresident alien not engaged in trade
or business in the Philippines, there could be no case for the application of
the legal provision concerning withholding agents, with the result that the
Republic would have no case against the Jai Alai and <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question, however, is one no longer <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
because it is one of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of
Tax Appeals having definitely found and declared as a fact that <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> was a nonresident alien <u>not engaged</u> in
trade or business in the Philippines, We must necessarily follow the settled
rule in this jurisdiction that findings of fact of the Court of Tax Appeals are
not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by Us, as long as they are supported
by substantial evidence which, in our opinion, is precisely the case in the one
now before Us (Gutierrez etc. vs. Court of Tax Appeals et al., 54 O.G. 2912;
Section 2, Rule 44, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Jai Alai's next contention is that the total amount of
P200,000.00 paid to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> in the years 1947 and
1948 was not payment of "interest, dividends, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> compensation, remunerations, emoluments, or other
fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income"
within the purview of Section 53(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code, but
was, instead, the consideration for the sale of an inchoate or contingent
interest belonging to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> to which said legal
provision does not apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">When and how, on several occasions, the amount aforesaid was paid
to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> is shown by the record as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the year 1947, the amount of P40,000.00 was paid directly by
the Jai Alai on September 2 by telegraphic transfer (through the Bank of the
Philippine Islands) sent to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> at 277 South
Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, California, U.S.A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 7, November 20, December 17, and
December 24, all of the same year 1947, four different amounts of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each were paid, the first two by the Jai Alai and
the remaining two by Madrigal &amp; Company, Inc. to Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
for and on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 11, March 11, April 10 and June
2, all of the year 1948, four separate amounts of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
each were paid by Madrigal and Company, Inc. to Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter remitted all said amounts to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> at the address already referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the evidence, <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>,
an Egyptian citizen, was admitted to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date month="9" day="13" year="1940">September 13, 1940</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From October of that year to January 1945, he
was the general manager of the Jai Alai Corporation, a duly organized entity
under the laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
engaged during all that time, under the name of Jai Alai Stadium, in a form of
legalized gambling, in which corporation <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>
and <span class="GramE">his wife owned 200 shares of stock</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 5, 1946, after he had appointed Jose
<span class="SpellE">Razon</span> as his attorney in-fact or agent "for the
purpose of filing my (his) tax returns and paying and compromising the taxes
which may be assessed against me (him) during my (his) absence" and after
securing a tax clearance upon the guaranty of one Jack George, <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> left the Philippines for the United
States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then he had been residing
in the City of Los Angeles, California, His re-entry permit expired, in fact,
on <st1:date month="10" day="14" year="1947">October 14, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 5, 1947 and in said city, the Jai
Alai, represented by its Vice-President Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
entered into a contract with <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>, whereby the
latter, in consideration of the sum of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
acknowledged full payment of all his claims for <u>percentages</u> earned by
the Jai Alai Sta­dium for the years 1940 to 1945, and to be earned during the
years 1946 to 1950 (Exhibit K).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contract expressly terminated the management contracts executed between the
same parties on <st1:date month="7" day="30" year="1939">July 30, 1939</st1:date>
and <st1:date month="11" day="18" year="1940">November 18, 1940</st1:date>,
pursuant to which <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>, as manager of the Jai
Alai Stadium located in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
was to receive a certain percentage of the receipts of the business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These "percentages earned, accrued, and
uncollected for the years 1940 to 1945, both inclusive;" and
"percentages to be earned or accrued during the years 1946 to 1950, both
inclusive" (Exhibit K) were the ones which <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>
considered fully paid with the afore­said sum of P200,000.00 which he
subsequently received.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bare facts stated above are, in our opinion, sufficient to
show the lack of merit of Jai Alai's contention that the aforesaid sum was the
purchase price of certain inchoate or contingent interests belonging to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
contrary, the undisputed facts of the case show beyond cavil that said amount was
in payment of <u>percentages</u> or <u>income</u> earned by <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>
during the years aforesaid out of the profits realized by the Jai Alai
stadium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being so, it was taxable, and
the corresponding withholding tax should have been withheld by "such
persons, corporations, and general co-partnerships <span class="GramE">who</span>
had the control, receipt, custody, disposal, or payment thereof to the person
entitled to it".</p>

<p class="BODY">But both the Jai Alai and <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> claim
not to fall under the provisions of Section 53(b) of the National In­ternal
Revenue Code precisely because they did not have the control, receipt, custody,
or disposal of the alleged taxable amount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again we find this to be without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> sent or
paid by the Jai Alai itself by telegraphic transfer to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>
on <st1:date year="1947" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1947</st1:date>, its
liability is beyond question.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the two different amounts of P20,000.00, each
paid to Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> on November 7 and November 20 of
the year 1947, it is also clear that it was the Jai Alai, through its then Vice-President
Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, who had custody and had disposed of and
paid said amounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection it
must be borne in mind that, in connection with these two pay­ments and the
later payments made in the years 1947 and 1948, <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
had a dual personality:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he acted as the
Vice-President and, therefore, the representative of the Jai Alai, and at the
same time as the attorney-in-fact of <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibit C (BIR record p. 468) he clearly
admitted that he was such attorney-in-fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he received the amounts from the Jai Alai to effect the payment to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>, he at the same time accepted the payment as
attorney-in-fact of the latter with the obligation of remitting them to him -
as, in fact, he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, not
only the Jai Alai but <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> also must be deemed to be
withholding agents within the purview of Section 53(b) of the National Internal
Revenue Code, and it was their duty, before actually paying the amounts to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>, to deduct the corresponding income tax due
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In relation to the different amounts of P20,000.00 each paid to
Jose <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> under similar circumstances on December 17
and December 24, 1947, and on February 11, March 11, April 10 and June 2, of
the year 1948, it is claimed that they were not payments made by the Jai Alai
but by Madrigal &amp; Company, Inc., and that inasmuch as the former did not
have the control over said amounts and did not dispose of or pay them to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> or his representative, the legal provision
already referred to does not apply to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This could be true, indeed, if the record did not sufficiently disclose
that Vicente Madrigal was the controlling stockholder of the Madrigal &amp;
Company, Inc. and of the Jai Alai Corporation up to the time of the trial below
(transcript, p. 207).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
payments of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each made in the name of
Madrigal &amp; Company, Inc. were charged to the personal account of Vicente
Madrigal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, piercing the veil
of corporate fiction, it can be said that said payments, albeit made in the
name of Madrigal &amp; Company, Inc., and later charged to the personal account
of Vicente Madrigal, were really payments made by the Jai Alai.</p>

<p class="BODY">What has been said heretofore leads us inexorably to the
conclusion that the Jai Alai was a withholding agent, and as such should have
withheld the corresponding tax from the total amount of P200,000.00, pursuant
to Section 53, subparagraphs (b) and (c) of the Revised Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Razon</span> or his Intestate Estate, however,
may be held liable in the same capacity only as regards the total amount of
P160<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which he had received and disposed of
simultaneously as Vice-President of the Jai Alai and as attorney-in-fact of <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>, because he had no part in the payment of the
first amount of P40,000.00 by the Jai Alai through telegraphic transfer sent
directly to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span> in the City of Los Angeles,
California.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the above, We consider as sufficiently disposed of the
first, third and fourth assignments of error made by the Republic in its brief
as appellant, as well as the first, second and third assignments of error made
in the Jai Alai's brief in the same capacity.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result, the decision appealed from is modified by sentencing
the Jai Alai to pay the Republic the corres­ponding withholding tax on the
total of the amounts paid to <span class="SpellE">Assadourian</span>, as follows:</p>
