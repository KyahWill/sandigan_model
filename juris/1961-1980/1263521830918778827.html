prayer for preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Sugay</span> and Fernando
R. <span class="SpellE">Manalastas</span>, executive and technical adviser to the
mayor and city public service of­ficer, respectively, of the City of Manila,
together with two other city officials, namely <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Pastolero</span>, chief, transportation division of the
Manila Police Department, and <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> San Pedro,
buyer in charge and member of the city committee on bids, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Montañes</span>, a trader, and two former city officials were
charged in three <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed against them by
the city <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office on July 22, 1971 for alleged
violations of sections 3 (g) and 4 (b) of Republic Act No. 3019<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in connection with the purchase of certain equipment for the City of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
were filed with the Circuit Criminal Court of Manila, presided by respondent
judge, and were docketed therein as Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-VI-664, 665 and
667.</p>

<p class="BODY">In substance, the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> charged
that the accused city officials, "conspiring and confederating together
and helping one another” entered in 1966 into three contracts, in behalf of the
City of Manila for the purchase and delivery of certain equipments at the
prices specified in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which equipments were actually delivered to and paid for by the city
government, and that said contracts were "manifestly and grossly
disadvantageous to the city government of Manila, to the damage and prejudice
of the latter." The <span class="SpellE">informations</span> also charged
that the private supplier of the equipment "knowingly induced or caused
the above-mentioned public officials and officers to enter into" the
questioned contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the arraignment on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="7">July
 28, 1971</st1:date>, at which petitioners and three of their co-accused were
arraigned and entered a not guilty plea, the trial of the cases was set by
respondent court for August 4, and 11, 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1971</st1:date>,
the prosecution filed an urgent motion for sus­pension from office, <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">lite</span></u>, of
the accused public officials, in­voking the mandatory provisions of section 13
of Republic Act No. 3019<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
for the suspension from office of public officers facing "criminal pro­secution
under a valid information under this Act."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed separate oppositions to the prosecution's move,
challenging the validity of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> on the
ground that the facts charged do not constitute an offense since no facts are
averred to justify the bare conclusion that the contracts were "manifestly
and grossly disadvantageous to the city government." Petitioners moved for
the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
and alternatively, that they be granted a pre-suspension hearing for a fair and
adequate opportunity to challenge the validity of the criminal proceedings
against them, which this Court has held to be an indispensable requirement for
suspension of public officers indicted under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court scheduled and heard the incident on August 4,
1971 and having considered it submitted upon filing of written opposition
thereto on the same day, issued its order of August 5, 1971 on the next
following day ordering the immediate suspension from office of petitioners as
well as their two other co-accused city officials, San Pedro and <span class="SpellE">Pas­tolero</span>, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court sustained
the prosecution's stand that "as to what is grossly and manifestly
disadvantageous, is a matter of evidence" which need not be alleged in the
information, adding that "had the accused been really serious in attacking
the validity of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, they would have
done so when they en­tered a plea of not guilty and not only when their
suspension was prayed for after their plea."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petitions to set aside respondent court's sus­pension
order and to annul as "insufficient and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span></u> the <span class="SpellE">informa­tions</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court issued upon the filing of the petitions, as prayed for,
its temporary restraining order of <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="8">August
 9, 1971</st1:date> enjoining, until further orders, enforcement of the
suspension order and further proceedings in the cases below.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Pastolero</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Cudiamat</span> (retired city treasurer)
subsequently moved for and were granted leave by the Court to intervene and
filed their separate petitions-in-intervention, joining the original
petitioners in seeking the relief sought in the cases at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, on behalf of respondents, instead of
filing their answer to the petition,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on August 18, 1971 a manifestation and motion "to allow judgment to
be rendered quashing the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in question and
ordering the city fiscal of Manila to file new <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
that will allege in clear, simple, and positive language all the essential
ingredients of the offense with which petitioners are charged," as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the petitioners seek to have this court
quash the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in question (Annexes A, A-1
&amp; A-2, of the amended petition) for being null and void and to permanently
enjoin respondent judge from enforcing his order of suspension dated <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1971</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the amended petition containing a prayer
to quash on file herein is tantamount to a withdrawal of petitioners' plea of
not guilty entered in respondent court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in order to abbreviate these proceedings,
respondent judge manifests his willingness, with the permission of this
honorable court, to lift said order of suspension, and respondents further
offer to allow judgment to be rendered quashing the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>,
as prayed for by petitioners, and ordering the City Fiscal of Manila to file
new <span class="SpellE">informations</span> that will allege in clear, simple,
and positive language all the essential ingredients of the offense with which
petitioners are charged, with such definiteness and reasonable certainty as
fully to apprise them of the nature and cause of the accusation against them
and enable them to prepare for trial, whereupon petitioners will be provided
all the opportunity to show cause why they should not be suspended thereupon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondents offer to allow judgment to be rendered
quashing the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in question and ordering
the City Fiscal of Manila to file new <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
that will allege in clear, simple, and positive language all the essential
ingredients of the offense with which petitioners are charged, with such
definiteness and reasonable certainty as fully to apprise them of the nature
and cause of the accusation against them and enable them to prepare for
trial."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the scheduled hearing of <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1971</st1:date>, the Court therefore required the
petitioners' written comment on the respondents' above-quoted manifestation and
motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both principal petitioners have filed their respective comments,
expressing no objection to the commendable non-contest plea entered herein by
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the challenged <span class="SpellE">informations</span> do not state the essential facts and
ingredients that would with sufficient definiteness and clarity fully apprise
the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against them - and violates
their right to be informed of "the acts or omissions complained of as
constituting the offense,"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
as would warrant the bare conclusion therein that they executed
"manifestly and grossly disadvantageous" contracts of purchase on
behalf of the city government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both petitioners, however, take exception to the Solicitor
General's manifestation, quoted above, that "the amended petition
containing a prayer to quash on file herein is tantamount to a withdrawal of
petitioners' plea of not guilty entered in respondent court," which was
obviously made to make clear the State's position that the challenged <span class="SpellE">informations</span> now to be quashed <u>for insufficiency</u> has
not placed the accused in jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Manalastas</span> best expresses the
exception, stating that he "affirms that he has not withdrawn his plea of
not guilty to the inform­ation, contrary to the allegations of the Solicitor
General; his said plea may have far reaching consequences in the subsequent
proceedings which might be taken against him and he does not want to waive any
right to which he may be entitled in preparing for his defense."</p>

<p class="BODY">In line with the State's abbreviation of the proceedings with
their no contest plea, and to avoid needless protracted argument, the Court
expressly holds that the quashing of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
<u>for insufficiency</u>, as prayed for by the petitioners-accused themselves,
can in no way be used by them to plead that they have already been placed in
jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but in line with the
Court's jurisprudence<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 117, sections 7 and 8.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> prayed for is
hereby granted and the respondent court's suspen­sion order of <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1971</st1:date> is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
filed against petitioners-accused in the cases below are likewise annulled and
declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the
provisions of Rule 117, section 7 and respondents' manifestation and motion of
August 18, 1971, respondent court is directed to order the city fiscal of
Manila to file new or amend­ed <span class="SpellE">informations</span> that will
allege in clear, simple and positive language all the essential ingredients of
the offense with which petitioners-accused are charged, with such definiteness
and reasonable certainty as to fully apprise them of the nature and cause of
the accusation against them and enable them to prepare for trial, and
thereafter in due course to grant them a pre-suspension hearing with fair and
adequate opportunity to challenge the validity of the new or amended <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed against them prior to issuing any order
of suspension from office as pro­vided in section 13 of Republic Act No.
