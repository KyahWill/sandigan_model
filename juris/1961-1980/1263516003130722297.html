				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for the review of the decision of the Court of
Appeals in its case CA-G.R. No. 24228-R was docketed as case G.R. No. L-22667
in this Supreme Court on April 8, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">By Resolution of May 6, 1964, the Court ordered that the Petition
be given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, in conformity with section 3 of Revised Rule 56, on
June 15, 1964, the Clerk of this Court notified and required the counsel for
petitioners, by registered mail, to file his printed brief within thirty (30)
days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite notice from the Postmaster sent on July 1, 1964, the
attorney for the appellant did not collect nor claim the notice of the Clerk of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice, therefore, became
effective five (5) days thereafter, on July 6, 1964 and the period to file the brief
on August 5, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No brief was filed
nor did petitioners ask for any extension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents were then required on August 24, 1964 to file their
brief; but they also failed to do so, despite receipt of the requirement on
August 25, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the last mentioned date, no pleadings or motions have been
filed by either party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of interest
is most evident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is ordered
dismissed for lack of prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">So ordered.</p>
