				<H3>VICTOR DE LOS REYES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PIO PASTORFIDE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a complaint filed on August 15, 1950, with the Court of First Instance of 
Basilan, Victor de los Reyes, registered owner of Lot No. 52 (Zamboanga de 
Basilan Cad. No. 74) situated in Lamitan, Basilan City, charged Pio Pastorfide 
with having illegally occupied a portion of his (Reyes) aforementioned lot, with 
an area of 1 hectare more or less, since August, 1945, continuing such Unlawful 
occupation notwithstanding his demand for the return thereof, and that defendant 
Pastorfide, appropriated for himself the fruits of the coconut trees planted 
thereon, at the rate of 1,000 nuts per quarter, with a total value of P1,200.00. 
It was, therefore, prayed that defendant be ordered to vacate the property and 
possession be restored to plaintiff; to pay a monthly rental of P5.00, for the 
use of the land, from August, 1945 to May, 1950 or a total of P290.00; to 
deliver the sum of Pl,200.00 realized from the sale of the nuts, with legal 
interest thereon from the filing of the complaint to the date of actual payment; 
to pay attorney's fees in the sum of P300.00 and costs.
<p>Defendant, in his answer, claimed ownership of the land in question, alleging 
that he acquired the same through purchase from the government; that he had been 
in open, public and continuous possession thereof since 1927, in the concept of 
an owner and without interruption from anybody; and that all existing 
improvements on the land were introduced by him.</p>
<p>On October 10, 1957, the court, finding that the lot in question (a portion 
of Lot No. 52, Zamboanga de Basilan Cad. No. 74) was covered by a torrens title 
in the name of plaintiff, rendered judgment for the latter, ordering defendant 
to vacate the same, pay plaintiff the sum of P1,470.00 as back rentals for the 
occupation and use of the land for the period from August, 1945, to October, 
1957, and a monthly rental of P10.00 until he vacates the same, reimburse, the 
sum of P220.00 spent for the re-survey of the property, and pay attorney's fees 
in the sum of P300.00, and costs. From this decision, defendant has directly 
appealed to us.</p>
<p>It has been duly established that the track of land occupied by 
defendant-appellant actually forms part of Lot No. 52, originally covered by OCT 
No. 330, issued in the name of Mora Amsia pursuant to a homestead patent granted 
to her in 1922, and currently covered by TCT No. 38-(T-1459) in the name of 
plaintiff-appellee, successor-in-interest of the original patentee (Exhs. A, B, 
and X). However, it also appears that notwithstanding such previous grant, the 
Bureau of Lands in 1935, acting upon the sales applicaion of the 
defendant-appellant, sold after public bidding, the same lot to the latter who, 
accordingly, paid the required charges. This awarding of the land to appellant 
in 1935, however, conferred unto him no right, because said property, having 
been previously adjudicated to a patentee, who obtained a corresponding 
certificate of title therefor, had thus already become private property, was 
released from the control and supervision of the Director of Lands,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> and could no longer be the subject of another 
adjudication. In fact, defendant's Sales Application No. 18589 (E-3540) by 
virtue of which the lot was sold to him, was later ordered cancelled by the 
Director of Lands for being within the private property of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Neither could appellant's alleged adverse and continuous occupation of the 
property be the basis of the claim of ownership. The land having been brought 
under the operation of the torrens system, the same cannot be acquired by 
prescription or adverse possession. (Sec. 46, Act 496, as amended).</p>
<p>Defendant-appellant questions the decision of the lower court awarding back 
rentals for the occupancy of the lot. It having been established that plaintiff 
had been deprived of the use thereof, the trial court did not err in awarding a 
reasonable rent for the occupancy and utilization of the land in question. But 
defendant claims that he had introduced improvements consisting of 60 
fruit-bearing coconut trees, and, therefore, is entitled to retain possession of 
the land until he is reimbursed for the value thereof. But this contention 
involves a question of fact and we can not go over the evidence to verify the 
truth of the claim of defendant that he really introduced these improvements. 
Indeed, the conclusion (although not categoric) of the trial judge is that 
defendant had made no improvement and that the coconuts were the plaintiff's. 
Said the court <em>a quo</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is to be noted, however, that although the defendant in open court 
declared that he bought the portion of Lot 52 from Imam Jahal with the 
improvements sometime in July, 1927 and that title was given to him after the 
same was fully investigated, no such title, nor deed or transfer was exhibited 
by the defendant; that the certificate of title for Lot 52 was issued on 
November 13, 1922; that the sales application of the defendant is dated October 
24, 1935; that the Bureau of Lands required defendant to file a sales 
application on July 1, 1935, the first payment made on May 27,1935, the yearly 
installment payments were all in arrears; that Tax Declaration No. 1515 (in the 
name of defendant covering the lot in question) is only for P100.00 without 
indications of either the 60 coconut trees nor of the ricefield and neither the 
tax payments for 1949, 1950 and 1951 likewise indicated any additional 
improvements of coconuts and ricefield; and that the Tax Declaration No. 2468 
showed ricefield unirrigated of 1.50 hectares assessed at P380.00 with no 
indication of other improvements and referred to therein that the same was 
reassessed from the anterior tax declaration."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendant-appellant also assails the correctness of the decision ordering him 
to pay the plaintiff the re-survey fee of P220.00, and attorney's fees. We agree 
with appellant on this point.</p>
<p>With respect to the re-survey fee, it may be gathered that the services of 
the surveyor were contracted by plaintiff for the purpose of determining the 
exact boundaries of his property (Lot No. 52). It is thus unfair that this 
expenditure, which was not even included in the complaint, be charged to 
another.</p>
<p>Similarly, attorney's fees can not be awarded to appellee simply because he 
established his ownership over the property in litigation. There being no proof 
to the contrary, it may be presumed that appellant's refusal to accede to 
appellee's demand, which led to the institution of the present case, was 
motivated by no other than an honest conviction or belief that he (defendant) 
had a valid cause under the law.</p>
<p>With the above modifications, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, 
without costs. So ordered.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion,
