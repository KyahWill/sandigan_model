<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time hour="10" minute="0">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
on the night of <st1:date month="9" day="28" year="1969">September 28, 1969</st1:date>,
Bernardo Molina was clubbed to death by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
in the presence of appellant Josefina Molina inside Molina's house at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lipcan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Abra</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The body of the victim was subsequently
carried by the two appellants to the ground and left at the foot of the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
then went to his house, changed his clothes and threw his bloodstained sweater,
undershirt and underwear, including the piece of wood he used in clubbing the
deceased, inside their toilet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After­wards,
he went to the municipal building and report­ed to the police authorities that
Bernardo had died <span style="">in an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police authorities, together with the
Municipal Health Officer, the Municipal Judge and a photographer went to <span class="SpellE">Lipcan</span> to conduct the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found the body of the deceased Bernardo
Molina sprawled at the foot of the bamboo ladder (Exhibit "I").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Blood had oozed </span>from the mouth, nose
and ears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were blood­stains on the
floor of the bedroom of the house, on the mat, as well as on the beddings of
the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bloodstains led to the
bamboo ladder where some of the stains could be found on the steps of the
ladder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When questioned by the police,
Josefina revealed that the assailant of her husband was Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon her
request, she was brought to the Office of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, where at about 2:00 o'clock in the morning of Sep­tember
29, 1969, she gave a written statement narrating the circumstances surrounding
the incident in question and pointing to appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
as the assailant of her husband (Exhibits "K" and
"9").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that extra-judicial
statement, she stated that immediately after 10:00 o'clock in the evening of
September 28, 1969, appellant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> went to
their house in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lipcan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, en­tered the room where she was sleeping with
her hus­band, Bernardo Molina, woke her up and had carnal knowledge of her;
that when Bernardo Molina woke up and attempted to rise from the floor, that
was the moment when <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> clubbed Bernardo, hitting
him on the head several times; that afterwards, she heard the sound of a body
being dragged downstairs and the voice of <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
saying that he was leaving and warning her not to say anything about the inci­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked out of the door and saw her hus­band
already lying prostrate at the foot of the <span style="">stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement was sworn
to by her before Municipal Judge Francisco T. <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At about </span><st1:time hour="16" minute="0"><span style="">4:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> that same morning, appel­lant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> was picked up by the police and brought to the
municipal building, and there he also executed a written statement (Exhibit
"L") admitting that he clubbed the victim several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in his extra-judicial confession of </span><st1:date month="9" day="29" year="1969"><span style="">September
 29, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
following statements appear:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"6. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span>
You stated that you killed Bernardo <span style="">Molina
</span><span style="">inside his house, will (you)
relate the true events or what happened when you killed him?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Last
night at the stated hour in Bar­rio <span class="SpellE">Lipcan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, inside the house
of Bernardo Molina I went and when I was under their house that was the time
when I pricked with a bamboo twig just under the place where Josephina Molina,
wife of Bernardo Molina was lying down, and I noticed that she was awake, <span style="">and not long afterwards she came down and
came </span>to <span style="">my place, and that was
the time when we did everything that wanted </span>both of us <span style="">to do, but before that in the night, Josephina
Molina told me </span><span style="">"THAT HER
HUSBAND WAS PLANNING TO KILL ME" </span>and <span style="">just after we were through what both of us did, Josephina went upstairs
inside (the) house, and because I can­not withstand anymore the plan of her
husband to kill me that was why I went upstairs and I went direct inside their
room and I saw Bernardo Molina lying down sleeping, and that was the time when
I clubbed him three times at the nape, and when he did not move anymore that
was the time when we both with Josephina Molina throw him downstairs of their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that I went home.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>7. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> What is the
weapon that you used in club­bing Bernardo Molina?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> A wooden club which is rounded and about two palms in
length, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> You stated that
while you were under the house of Bernardo Molina and you pricked with bamboo
twig in awakening Josephina Molina and not long afterwards she came down and
went to you, what is your rel<span style="">ationship
with Josephina Molina the wife of Bernardo Molina?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> Josephina Molina is my paramour.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> How long have
you been in that relation­ship with Josephina Molina?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> What I know is that it is already about 10 years,
Sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because her
daughter who is already 12 <span style="">years </span>old
was still small.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>10. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> With this
relationship that you have with Josephina Molina did not her hus­band Bernardo
Molina notice, so that Josephina told you that her husband was planning to kill
you? </blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> Probably he had already, Sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because that is what his
wife told me.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>11. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> Who witnessed
when you killed Bernardo Molina that you know?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> It was only Josephina the wife of Ber­nardo Molina, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> What did
Josephina say when you delivered club blows at her husband?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> 'That is enough he is dead, let us bring him down' , that
is what she said, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>13. Q:-Therefore, you want to say that you and
Josephina Molina the wife of Bernardo helped each other in this killing?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> I told her when she was going up, 'I'LL <span style="">GO AHEAD OF HIM' </span>and what she answered
to me <span style="">'IT IS UP TO YOU' , </span>Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>14. Q: And where was Josephina while you were
clubbing Bernardo, if you remember?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A:
She was there lying down, and when Ber­nardo did not move she said that is <span style="">enough.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>15. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> What was your
clothing when you went to club Bernardo Molina and also your trou­sers that you
used?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> Sweater with long sleeves colored light gray and white
shorts, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>16. <span style="">Q:-<span class="GramE">,Where</span> are these sweater </span>and <span style="">shorts?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> I dropped it inside our toilet, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>17. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> And where is
that club that you said you used in clubbing Bernardo Molina?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> I also dropped it
inside our toilet, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>18. Q: Is it not correct that you kill Bernardo
Molina because he surprised you while <span style="">you
were beside his wife inside their room that night?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> No, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>19. Q: - So that in this where you clubbed to
death Bernardo Molina you admit as your guilt?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> Yes, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>20. Q: Do you have something more to add to this
statement of yours?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span class="GramE">:-</span> No more,
Sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Unless there are
more questions to me.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>21. Q<span class="GramE">:-</span> Were you
forced, intimidated, instructed or you were mauled in this where you made your
statement?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After executing his aforesaid written statement, he was brought
to the residence of Judge Francisco T. <span class="SpellE">Valera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> sent
the policemen out of his house, apprised <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> of
his constitutional rights, <span class="GramE">then</span> read to him the
contents of his aforementioned extra-judicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After satisfy­ing himself that the statement
was given voluntarily, he administered the oath to said appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appel­lant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
then guided the police authorities to his house where, in their presence, he
retrieved from the toilet his bloodstained clothes, as well as the piece of
wood which he used in clubbing the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dr. Luis F. <span class="SpellE">Briñgas</span>, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, who conducted the autopsy, testi­fied that the
deceased died instantaneously as a result </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">cardio-respiratory
failure caused by </span><span style="">"cere­</span><span style="">bral compressions and hemorrhages".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased sustained the following wounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

extremities, the deeper tissues unevenly divided with tags <span style="">of tissues showing in the wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The edges and surrounding parts bruised and

No. I, plated horizontally form mid point of the Lace­rated Wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">characteristics of the

other wounds above, but extending opposite Lacerated Wound No. <span class="GramE">I only from the right side."</span> <span class="GramE">(Exhibit
"A").</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">He
also declared that </span>on the basis of the location and direction of the
wounds, <span style="">the assailant must have been
behind the </span>victim <span style="">and said </span>wounds
were inflict<span style="">ed while the victim was
lying in prone position, face downwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both appellants <span style="">admit
that it was </span>appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> who inflicted
the fatal blows on the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Verzola</span></span><span class="GramE">,
however, after impugning the veracity of the facts contained in his
extra-judicial confess­ion (Exhibit "L"), claims that he did so in
self-defense.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> testified that while he was feeding his two cows in
front of his house at about <st1:time hour="10" minute="0">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
on the night of <st1:date month="9" day="28" year="1969">September 28, 1969</st1:date>,
he heard cries for help coming from the direction of the house of Bernardo
Molina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon recognizing it to be the
voice of the wife of Bernardo, he proceeded to the couple's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the yard of said house, he
heard the loud voice of a man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
thinking that some intruder had entered the <span class="SpellE">Molinas</span>'
residence, he decided to arm himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the threshold of the ladder, he picked up a part of a plow (Exhibit
"B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the door of the room,
he heard the man say: <span style="">"Vulva </span>of
your mother, I will kill you." As he entered the small room, he saw his
co-appellant Josefina Molina crouching in a corner, being maltreated by
Bernardo Molina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Bernardo noticed
his presence, he <span style="">said: "Vulva </span>of
your mother, I will kill all of you." At that <span style="">juncture, Bernardo stooped to pick up a bolo from the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Bernardo was still bending towards the floor,
<span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> struck him twice with the piece of wood,
hitting the head of the victim, causing him to fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he had fallen, he tried to revive the
victim by placing the head of the latter on his lap and shaking it, saying: "Hoy,
Hoy, <span class="GramE">Hoy</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">He explained that this
was the reason why there were bloodstains on his clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Josefina asked him </span><span style="">what </span><span style="">happened, he replied that Bernardo met an
acci­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At his suggestion, they both
carried the body of the victim down the stairs because according to him they
wanted to bring the body to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the hospital was too far and it was too dark, they left the body on
the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After instructing Josefina
to go and summon persons to help the victim, he went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After changing his clothes and throwing his
bloodstained clothing inside their toilet, he went to the municipal building in
<span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, and reported
to the guard that there was a person who met an accident in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lipcan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">His co-appellant, Josefina Molina, also testi­fied that during the
first week of September, <span style="">1969 </span>she
had a quarrel with her husband because of Bernardo's jealousy of three men,
namely, <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocarile</span>,
Santos <span class="SpellE">Beloy</span> and appellant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>; that on the night in question, she and her husband
had another quarrel and in the course thereof, she was boxed and strangled by
her husband, causing her to shout for help; that after a while, as she was
crouching in a corner of the house, with her face covered, she heard a
thud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she looked up, <span style="">she noticed that <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
was already inside their room, squatting on the floor and holding on his lap
the head of her husband; that while <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> was
shaking the head of the deceased, he was saying: "Hoy, Hoy, <span class="GramE">Hoy</span>." She claimed that out of fear, she assisted <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> in carrying the body of Bernardo at the foot of the
stairs where <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> left her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After looking at the wounds of her husband,
she be­came afraid and went up the house where her children were sleeping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both appellants claimed that they were not aware of the contents
of their extra-judicial con­fessions <span style="">as
</span>they were made to sign them by the police authorities without being able
to read their contents.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that once an accused has admitted the
killing of a human being, the bur­den is on him to establish the existence of
any circumstance which may justify the killing or at least attenuate the
offense committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish his
exculpation, or the justification for the act, he must prove such affirmative
allegation by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of
that for the prosecution, for even if that were weak, it could not be
disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">It is evident that no such proof was
adduced by appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, the conduct of appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span>
immediately after he committed the crime is incom­patible with the reaction of
one who killed another <span style="">in legitimate
self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he claims that he
brought the victim down the stairs in order to bring him to the hospital, yet
when he was able to get a jeep he did not utilize it for that purpose but
instead used it in going to town.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, although appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> was
present at the scene of the crime when the police authorities were
investigating the case, he kept quiet about the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only from Josefina Molina that the
police learned for the first time that <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> was
the assailant of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
then, Josefina had to request the police authorities to bring her to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> so that she could talk more freely about the
killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For his part, <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> attempted to conceal his participation in the crime
by hiding inside his toilet his bloodstained clothes and the weapon that he
used in clubbing the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
actuations of appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> reveal a <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> which is incompatible with the reaction of one
who acted in legitimate self-defense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">More
signifi­cant, however, are the undisputed physical facts of the case, such as
the nature, character and location of the wounds sustained by the deceased and
the presence of the bloodstains on the beddings of the vic­tim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts and circumstances belie the claim
of the appellant that he clubbed the victim in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they sufficiently indi­cate
that the fatal injuries were inflicted upon the victim when the latter was
lying defenseless on the floor, as he was either sleeping or was just begin­ning
to wake up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although appellant Josefina Molina admitted in her extra-judicial
statement (Exhibits "K", "K-1" to "K-9") that she
was the paramour of her co-appel­lant for over <span style="">a </span>year, there is no proof that she had knowledge of the criminal
design of her co-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has
she cooperated with him by previous or simultaneous acts, much less is there
any showing that she supplied the principal with <span style="">material or moral aid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her only
participation was in assisting her co-appellant in bringing the body of the
deceased to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question,
therefore, is whether or not by said overt act she could be held criminally
responsible as an accessory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An accessory does not participate in the crim­inal design, nor
cooperate in the commission of the felony, but, with knowledge of the
commission of the <span style="">crime, he
subsequently takes part in three (3) ways: (a) by profiting from the effects of
the crime; (b) by concealing the body, effects or instruments of </span>the
crime in order to prevent its discovery; and (c) by assisting in the escape or
concealment of the principal of the crime, provided he acts with abuse of his
public functions or the principal is guilty of treason, parricide, murder, or
an attempt to take the life of the Chief Executive, or is known to be
habitually guilty of some other crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The main difference separating accessories after the fact from principal
and accomplice lies in the fact that the responsibility of the accessories is
subsequent to the consummation of the crime and subordinate to that of the
principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the trial court, "the bringing down of the body
of the victim * * * was to destroy the body of the crime, or its effect, that
is, to make it appear that the death of the victim was caused by an
accident." We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
iota of proof that Josefina Molina ever attempted "to destroy the body of
the crime" or to make it appear that death of the victim was
accidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
Josefina testified that she helped her co-appellant bring the body of the de­ceased

she assisted her co-appellant without duress, simply assisting <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> in bringing the body down the house to the foot of
the stairs and leaving said body for anyone to see, cannot be classified as an
attempt to conceal or destroy the body of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The concealing or destroying of the body of
the crime, the effects or instruments thereof, must be done to prevent the
discovery of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the body was left at the foot of the stairs at a place where it was easily
visible to the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such
circumstances, there could not have been any attempt on the part of Josefina to
conceal or destroy the body of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the judgment, insofar
as appellant <span class="SpellE">Verzola</span> is concerned, is hereby
AFFIRMED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment against Josefina
