injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1962</st1:date>
an amended complaint for robbery in band was filed by the Philippine
Constabulary authorities against the petitioners Jaime <span class="SpellE">Bandiala</span>
and Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> (and two other persons) with the
justice of the peace (now municipal) court of <span class="SpellE">Sapangdalaga</span>
in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 23rd day of February 1962, more or less
4:20 o'clock in the afternoon, at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bitibot</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sapangdalaga</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, Philippines and within the preliminary
jurisdiction of this Honor­able Court, the above-named accused with delibe­rate
intent to gain and with force or intimidation, conspiring and confederating
together, wearing uniform in the guise of PC to afford impunity armed with
assorted firearms, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
hold-up Lim Bing San at gunpoint, hogtied him together with one passenger <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Co while riding on a car driven by the other
co-accused Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>, and robbed the said Lim
Bing San of cash paper bills amounting to P60,000.00 ... all belonging to Lim
Bing San in the name of Lee Gee &amp; Com­pany, to the damage and prejudice of
the said Lim Bing San of Lee Gee Co. of the aforementioned amount."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The requisite preliminary investigation, second stage, was
thereafter conducted by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners, assisted by counsel, asked for and were given copies of the
affidavits submit­ted to support the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of these affidavits was that of Lim Bing San, one of the alleged
offended parties, which contains a recital that he was carried, with his hands
tied, from <span class="SpellE">Sapang­dalaga</span> to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(a distance of about 90 kilometers) at which latter place he was released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Other documentary proof adduced shows that
only two of the alleged offenders were armed).</p>

<p class="BODY">Only <span class="SpellE">Bandiala</span> went through the second
stage of preliminary investigation, as <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> waived
the same, and the two other ac­cused were then still at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the investigation, <span class="SpellE">Bandiala</span>
presented one witness, a PC sergeant, who testified on the circumstances
leading to his arrest, and on his alleged confession of criminal
participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This supposed confession,
which appears to have been subscribed and sworn to before Judge Joaquin T. <span class="SpellE">Maabong</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, re­cites explicitly that one
of the victims was hogtied and carried in­side his car from <span class="SpellE">Sapangdalaga</span>
to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bandiala's</span> re­quest
for a copy of this written confession, made during the inves­tigation, was
refused by the respondent fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1963</st1:date>
the presiding judge of the municipal court, finding a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case against the petitioners (accused therein), forthwith remanded the case to
the respondent Court of First Instance for trial on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the court's decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court, after a serious study of the records of this
case, and taking further into con­sideration the circumstances attendant during
the preliminary investigation of this case, FINDS that there is a PRIMA-FACIE
case against the accused herein.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the respondent Fiscal filed with the respondent CFI
an information dated <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1963</st1:date>
charging the petitioners with "Robbery with Kidnapping." This
information reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned accuses Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>
and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Bandiala</span> of the crime of Robbery with
Kidnapping, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 23rd day of February 1962, in barrio <span class="SpellE">Bitibot</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Da­laga</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the said accused, conspiring and confederating together in their common intent
of gain with Francis­co <span class="SpellE">Lacaya</span> and John Doe alias
Tony who are still at large, and simulating public authority as Constabulary
soldiers with uniform, patches and guns, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully, feloniously and by means of violence and intimidation of persons,
stop the automobile of the complainant at the uninhabited section of the
national highway at said barrio, and then hogtied the passengers at gun-point,
after which, the said accused ransacked the car and took posses­sion of the
money therein amounting to Sixty Thou­sand Pesos (P60,000.00) which they
carried away in escaping to <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City in the same
car, to the damage and prejudice of Lee Gee &amp; Co., the owner, in the said
sum of P60,000.00; and then, while thus running away with the rich booty, the
said accused likewise willfully, unlawfully and feloniously took along with
them, kidnapped or deprived of his liber­ty, one Lim Bing San whom they
detained inside the car from <span class="SpellE">Bitibot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalaga</span> to <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City whereat he was released.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to par. 4, Art. 294 in connection with Art. 295 and
par. 2, Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code, with the aggravating circumstances
of (1) disguise and (2) use of motor vehicle; and abuse of confidence as
against Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> only."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1965</st1:date>,
upon arraignment, the petitioners dis­covered, to borrow their language,
"for the first time and to their great dismay," that the respondent
Fiscal had filed an information for "Robbery with Kidnapping" instead
of "Robbery in Band." They therefore moved, in open court, to quash
the said information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After giving both
parties the opportunity to expound in writing their respective positions, the
respondent CFI issued the order here in dispute, dated <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1965</st1:date>, denying the petitioners' motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fundamentally, the petitioners' theory is that the respon­dent
Fiscal altered the substance of the crime of which they were accused before the
municipal court by charging them with the "far more serious and complex
offense of robbery with kidnapping," without conducting any preliminary
investigation with respect thereto, in violation of section 1687 of the Revised
Administrative Code, as amended by Republic Acts 732 and 1799.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the respondent Fiscal maintains that the
preliminary investigation conducted by the municipal court in­cluded the charge
of kidnapping and that, therefore, no further preliminary investigation on this
point was necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the said
respondent Fiscal, while previously vacillating on this aspect of the case, now
admits that "the kidnapping was merely incidental to the principal
criminal purpose which was robbery," and "is absorbed by the robbery
of which it formed a part."</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the respondent Fiscal that at the prelimi­nary
investigation by the municipal court the petitioners were adequately informed
that one of the offended parties was hogtied inside his car in <span class="SpellE">Sapangdalaga</span> and thereafter carried to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
whereat he was released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not,
however, accord merit to his argument before the lower court that the
transporting of the victim in this case is, by itself, sufficient to establish
the "complex crime of robbery with kidnapping." Indeed, taking the
recitals of the parties before us as our frame of reference, it would appear
that the alleged temporary detention of the offended Chinese merchant was used
merely as a ploy to give the offenders sufficient time to reach a planned
destination and thereby prevent an early alarm to the police authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Fiscal himself, who is in a
better position at this stage of the proceed­ings to appreciate the legal
implications of all the evidence avail­able to him, in effect concedes this
point of view.</p>

<p class="BODY">A preliminary investigation, it must be borne in mind, is a
practical device created by statute and by mandate of our Rules of Court, principally
for the purpose of preventing hasty, mali­cious and ill-advised prosecutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The position taken by the Fiscal that because section 13 of Rule
110 of the Rules of Court authorizes him to amend the infor­mation in substance
without leave of court at any time before the defendant pleads, he may
therefore change the nature of the of­fense charged in the amended complaint,
which was the subject of a formal preliminary investigation by the municipal
court, by raising the category of the crime to a higher one, based on the
evidence in his possession, loses sight of the fact that section 13 of Rule 110
was not intended to give a prosecuting official an un­due advantage over the
accused in the sense that he may withhold evidence at the preliminary
investigation conducted by the municipal court only to uncover and reveal it
later for the purpose of raising the category of the offense to be charged by
him in the in­formation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court on the matter of preliminary investi­gation,
construed in their integrated entirety, direct that, in the circumstances here
obtaining, the Fiscal, if he believes that he should raise the category of the
offense, must conduct a prelimi­nary investigation anew as to the entire
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fundamental prin­ciples of fair
play dictate this course of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Fiscal is not allowed by the Rules of Court to wait in ambush; the role of a
Fis­cal is not mainly to prosecute, but essentially to do justice to every man
and to assist the courts in dispensing that justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it will be noted that the information filed by
the respondent Fiscal recites that the malefactors "hogtied the passengers
at gun-point, after which" they committed the robbery, and then fled to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
taking with them the offended party Lim Bing San.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise noteworthy is the fact that while
the in­formation charges that the four accused simulated "public autho­rity
as Constabulary soldiers, with uniform, patches and guns," from which it
would appear that the crime of robbery was commit­ted by a band, nothing in the
entirety of the evidence adduced at the formal preliminary investigation
conducted by the justice of the peace of <span class="SpellE">Sapangdalaga</span>
supports the inference that all the four accused were armed; upon the contrary,
the said evidence unmis­takably indicates that only two of the four
perpetrators were armed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing, it is apparent that unless the
respondent Fiscal has new evidence to the contrary, the crime al­legedly
committed is merely that of robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the respondent Fiscal has new evidence which, added to the
proof which, was already in his hands when the motion to quash was filed with
the respondent court, would justify his charging the petitioners with the crime
of "robbery with kidnapping" (assuming that such complex crime does
exist within the pale of our penal law), he may file what he deems to be the
proper information, al­ways with the injunction that the accused be given ample
opportu­nity at a full-blown preliminary investigation to demonstrate that what
the Fiscal regards as "kidnapping" in the legal sense was merely an
incident of, and is therefore absorbed in, the crime of robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the disputed order is modified in the sense
that the respondent Fiscal shall grant the petitioners a new preli­minary
investigation; the respondent Court is hereby directed to hold the case below
in abeyance until after the outcome of the said preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <u>officio</u>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the main opinion of Justice Castro insofar as it
holds that since the petitioners-accused were charged by res­pondent fiscal in
the information filed by him with respondent court with the more serious crime of
kidnapping under Article 267, para­graph 2 of the Revised Penal Code (committed
with simulation of public authority and punishable by reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> to death) <span class="SpellE">complexed</span> with
and in addition to the crime of robbery in band for which they were originally
charged in and investigated by the municipal court, respondent fiscal
"must conduct a preliminary investigation anew as to the entire
charge."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, following the established rule that failure to hold
preliminary investigation cannot be made the basis of a motion to quash, and
that should such a motion be filed, the court should not dismiss the case but
conduct its own preliminary investigation or require the fiscal to grant
petitioners the right to a new preliminary investigation, since lack of preliminary
investigation does not affect the court's jurisdiction to try the case,
although prohibition would lie to prevent trial until the accused shall have
been granted the right of a preliminary investigation, if seasonably invoked as
in this case - I do not believe that the petitioners' motion to quash,
correctly denied by respondent court, should be ordered sustained in the
present ori­ginal action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather,
respondent court's omission in not having or­dered such preliminary
investigation to be conducted should be herein remedied and petitioners' right
thereto therefore granted herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further proceedings in the case below should await the results of
such preliminary investigation to be conducted by respondent fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I respectfully submit that it is premature at
this stage and on the mere basis of the record of the summary preliminary
investigation conducted by the municipal court in accordance with Rule 112,
section 10 (wherein petitioner-accused <span class="SpellE">Bandiala</span>
presented one sole witness and his co-petitioner <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>
waived the second stage of preliminary investigation) and of the recitals of
the parties herein, to anticipate the weight and value that should be given to
the evidence - which properly pertains in the first instance to the fiscal at
the investigation stage and to the trial court at the trial of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">For instance, it appears to me that respondent <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> sub­mittal that "the kidnapping was merely
incidental to the principal criminal purpose which was robbery" and
"is absorbed by the robbery of which it formed a part"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
is based on an erroneous equation and compounding of criminal acts with the
criminal's purpose, and should not serve as warrant for an advance opinion of
the court at this pre­trial stage that the evidence in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
possession is "not sufficient to establish the complex crime of robbery
with kidnapping".<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Based on the recitals of the parties and on the text of the information which
are used as the frame of reference in the main opinion, it could not be cor­rectly
stated that the more serious crime of kidnapping was absorbed by the robbery,
which concededly was the first criminal purpose of the accused; the more
appropriate conclusion would be that two separate offenses of robbery <u>and</u>
kidnapping are charged in the information, whatever may have been the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> criminal purpose in kidnapping, <u>after</u> the
robbery, one of the car's passengers, whether it was to facilitate their escape
and prevent an early alarm (in furtherance of the same purpose of robbery) or
to hold the passenger as a hostage (in furtherance, yet, of another purpose).</p>
