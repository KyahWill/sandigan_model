				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case originated in a shipment from <st1:place><st1:city>Hamburg</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place> of 288 bundles of
axle shafts for trucks, consigned to Yu Brothers Trading Company <span style="">in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent­ly, these were discharged from the
<span style="">vessel MV </span>"<st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
and delivered to the Bureau of Customs as the then <span class="SpellE"><span style="">arrastre</span></span><span style=""> </span>operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of these, the
Bureau of Customs delivered only 227 bundles of which <span style="">6 </span>bundles were empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the loss, the consignee claimed a total of P1<span class="GramE">,543.58</span>
from the Bureau of Customs and the Insurance Company of <st1:place>North
 America</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the said
insurer paid the consignee, it filed suit as <span class="SpellE">sub­rogee</span>,
against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Bu­reau of Customs, and was granted recovery of P1<span class="GramE">,543.58</span>
by the City Court of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal was
made to the Court of First Instance of Manila where the Insurance Company of <st1:place>North
 America</st1:place> in its amended complaint dated <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="7">July <span style="">3, </span>1964</st1:date>
sought recovery of P<span style="">1<span class="GramE">,543.58</span>
</span>against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the defendants answered, during the pre-trial conference,
the parties, coming to a partial stipulation of facts, limited the issues to
defendants' immunity from suit and the court's jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="6">June <span style="">7, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the Court of First Instance
dismissed the case on the ground that the Bureau of Customs being an agency of
the national government, the suit against it is a suit against the Republic
which is immune from suit without its consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court did not err.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>Mobil Philippines Exploration v. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service &amp; Bureau of Customs</u>, <span style="">L-23139,
</span>Dec. 17, 1966, We held that the Bureau of <span style="">Customs, </span>acting as part of the machinery of the <span style="">national </span>government in the operation
of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, as a necessary incident of
its prime governmental <span style="">function, </span>is
immune from suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">This point renders it unnecessary to pass upon the remaining
issues of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, without
costs.</p>
