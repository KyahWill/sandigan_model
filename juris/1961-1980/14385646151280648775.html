Its workers were being supplied by UWFA. On November 11, 1955, the company terminated the services of the petitioners in G.R. No. L-37693 who are members of UWFA. A complaint for unfair labor practice was consequently instituted against the Company and, in due course, the Court of Industrial Relations found the Company guilty of unfair labor practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On appeal, this Court in No. L-21696 affirmed on February 25, I967<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> said decision of the Court of Industrial Relations.<br><br>After this Court's decision had become final and executory, the Court of Industrial Relations directed the Chief Examiner to compute the back wages due each of the 13 8 UWFA members. In his initial report, the Chief Examiner informed the court of his inability to make an intelligent and fair computation and asked for guidance as to the proper basis of computation. In an order dated February 24, 1969, the Court of Industrial Relations adopted the suggested basis of computation in the Company's motion dated May 10, 1968 in view of the conformity thereto of UWFA embodied in their motion dated June 29, 1968, stating that the same was "fair enough to determine the earnings of every complainant every season, basing the same from the individual earnings of those who were not discharged and which is also in consonance with the rules laid down by the Court in other cases similarly situated."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The pertinent portion of the Company's motion which the Court of Industrial Relations adopted reads:<br><blockquote>"2. That, inasmuch as the payrolls for the six (6) vessels stevedored at Hinigaran, Negros Occidental are still available (Report, p. 2) and it can <i>be ascertained therefrom the percentage of the amounts actually paid to the complainants in relation to the payrolls prior to the stoppage of their work, it is respectfully submitted that the same percentage be used in ascertaining the amounts they could have earned had they participated in the stevedoring of the vessels that docked at Hinigaran from November 12, 195 5 to June 27, 1961,</i> the payrolls for said period being available for examination;</blockquote>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That respondents are hereby submitting a schedule showing the tonnage handled for each of the vessels during the period from November 2, 1955 to June 27, 1961, including the corresponding gang hours, to supplement Appendix "1" of the Report and which schedule is made an integral part hereof as schedule "A".<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That the foregoing is the most reasonable method of computing the amounts due the several complainants, taking into consideration the nature of their work and the irregularity of their schedule." (Italics supplied.)<br><br>Complying with the order dated February 24, 1969, the Chief Examiner submitted his report dated August 20, 1969, wherein his computation was summarized as follows:<br><blockquote>'"10. That the computed backwages of the 183 complainants in this case — covering the period <i>from November 12, 1955 (date of lay¬off) until July 31, 1969 (they have not as yet been reinstated as of this date) — will amount to P78,468.48 (See Appendix "I" for details).</i><br><br>&nbsp;11. The computed backwages of the 138 complainants in the case — covering the period from November 12, 1955 (date of lay-off)<i> until June 27, 1961 (there was no more operation or stevedoring work dose from this date up to the present)</i> it will amount to P32,906.59 (See Appendix "1" for details)." (Italics supplied) </blockquote>Both UWFA and the Company filed their oppositions to the Chief Examiner's report of August 20, 1969. In the course of the hearing of their oppositions UWFA and the Company agreed that the Chief Examiner should prepare another computation report, which would only be "for the personal use of the counsels" in reaching a common ground for agreement. The report, dated December 15, 1969, did not, however, serve its purpose and the Chief Examiner was again required to prepare another supplementary report, which he submitted on October 10, 1970.<br><br>The October 10, 1970 supplementary report computed the back wages due the dismissed UWFA members on the basis of the total milling days of the two sugar centrals which employ the Company's stevedoring services. This report summarizes the computation as follows:<br><blockquote>"1. Based from the total milling days of 2,605 (operating days) followed by the Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company Inc. and multiplied by daily basic rates of the complainants at the time of their dismissal on November 12, 1955, the total computed backwages of the complainants from November 12, 1955 (date of dismissal) up to November 30, 1967 (complainants had not been reinstated as at the close of office hours on this date) — before deducting whatever amounts, if any, the complainants might have been able to receive from other employers or other establishments during this period covered by the back wages — is PI ,634,711.10 (See Appendix ' 1' for details).<br><br>2. Based from the total milling days of 2,347 (operating days) followed by the La Carlota Sugar Central and multiplied by the basic daily rates of the complainants at the time of their dismissal on November 12, 1955, the total computed back wages of the complainants from November 12, 1955 (date of dismissal) up to November 30, 1967 (complainants had not been reinstated as at the close of office hours on this date) —¦ before deducting whatever amounts, if any, the complainants might have been able to receive from other employers or other establishments during this period covered by the back wages, is pi ,473,427.60 (see Appendix ' I' for details)."</blockquote>After several hearings, the court issued its order dated October 30, 1972 approving the report dated August 20, 1969, directing the company to deposit with the court the amount of F78,468.48 representing the back wages of complainants from November 12, 1955 up to July 31, 1969, and directing the Chief Examiner to compute the back wages due the complainants from August 1, 1969 up to the date they are actually reinstated for submission to the court for further disposition.<br><br>Both UWFA and the Company filed their motions for reconsideration of the order dated February 24, 1969 but the court sitting <i>en banc</i> denied their motions in its Resolution dated September 26, 1973. Hence these petitions.<br><br>UWFA, the intervenors and the Company separately questioned the computation of back wages approved by the court on October 30, 1972. UWFA claims that the award of back wages amounting to P78,468.48 for the period covering thirteen (13) years, eight (8) months and nineteen (19) days is unfair, without foundation in tact and in law, and constitutes an abuse of discretion on the part of the court. The intervenors contend that the basis of computation approved was one-sided, adopted strictly from the suggestions of the Company, and thus, the back wages are unconsciously too meager to be fair, just and equitable. The Company, on the other hand, contends that since the 138 dismissed employees are not entitled to back wages after the cessation of operations at the Company's Hinigaran branch on June 27, 1961, the computation of back wages should not extend beyond that date.<br><br>UWFA and the intervenors never questioned the correctness of the actual computations in the report of the Chief Examiner dated August 20, 1969 in so far as it strictly conforms to the basis and mode of computation indicated in the order of the court dated February 24, 1969. What UWFA and the intervenors now seek is the adoption of a different computation which is based on the total milling days of the two sugar centrals as reported by the Chief Examiner on October 10, 1970.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the brief filed for the complainants-petitioners by Atty. Eliseo P. Legaspi, <i>Rollo</i>, (L-37693), p. 598, it is averred that the correct computation of the back wages is:<br><blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoings it is most respectfully prayed that the correct computation should he P4.60 x 138 claimants x 30 days 8 months x 19 years as of November 12, 1974, this year equals P-2,894,688.00 back wages for 138 claimants-petitioners."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>The employer company, petitioner in G.R. Mo. L-37650, contends that no back wages should be paid to the complainants-laborers after the company had ceased to operate in Hinigaran, Occidental Negros, on June 27, 1961.<br><br>Anent the claim of the complainants-workers that the back wages as of November 12, 1974 had a total of P2,894,688.00,<br>the employer company states:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>"Petitioners submit that 'the correct computation should be P4.60 x 138 claimants x 30 days x 8 months x 19 years as of November 12, 1974, this year equals P2,894,688.00 back wages for 138 claimants-petitioner.' As we have illustrated earlier in this refutation, such a computation in this refutation, such a computation overlooks the peculiar circumstances attending the stevedoring operations at Hinigaran. This computation ignores the fact that petitioners herein represented only a small faction of the total work force called upon to participate in the stevedoring operations at Hinigaran, and that because labor supply far exceeded the demand for it, it became necessary to institute the so-called 'rotation system.' where several groups or 'gangs" took turns. Apparently, this computation is also premised on the wrong assumption that petitioners worked everyday during the milling season and overlooks the more important consideration that there was stevedoring operation only whenever a foreign vessel was in Hinigaran. Furthermore, the amount of P2,894.688.00 being prayed by the petitioners overwhelmingly surpassed the total payroll of P628.347.06 found by the Court Examiner baaed on the actual operations of the respondent between November 12, 1955 and June 27, 1961, the date when the SS 'Patriakos' — the last foreign vessel to call at Hinigaran — left port.<br><br>In the light of the foregoing, it is therefore most respectfully submitted that the alternative computation being suggested by the petitioners this late hour in the day is not only fantastic and unrealistic, but also irrational and unjust."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The employer company insists that the correct amount to be paid as back wages is P78,468.48 as found by the Court of Industrial Relations.<br><br>It is thus seen that there is a wide divergence between the amounts fixed by the employer company and the workers.<br><br>The records of both cases disclose that there is no accurate basis for computing the back wages. Attached to the record of case No. L-37693 as Annex "T"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> is the following computation submitted by the Chief Examiner on December 12, 1969:<br><br><div
