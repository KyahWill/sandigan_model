				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Justice of the Peace Court of Wright, Samar , Juan E. Reas filed an 
action styled unlawful detainer against Pedro Gabani, Eustaquio Orabiles, 
Alejandro Obina and Claro Obidos (Civil Case No. 11). A motion for dismissal was 
presented by defendants therein, on the ground that the court lacked 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case. The motion having been denied, the 
defendants answered. After due hearing, the inferior court, on October 14, 1957, 
ordered each of the defendants to give as rentals, 3 sacks of palay and 3 sacks 
of corn for the year 1955 and 1956 or P39.00 for each of them or a total of 
P156.00; to pay interest; to vacate the land and restore possession thereof to 
the plaintiff, to pay P200.00 as damages and P300.00 for attorney's fees. On 
December 26, 1957, plaintiff therein moved for the execution of the judgment 
which was issued on March 24, 1958 The defendants could not furnish the bond of 
P500.00 fixed by the inferior court, to stay the execution of the judgment. On 
May 21, 1958, a notice of attachment of the property was filed by the Sheriff 
with the Register of Deeds.
<p>On September 20, 1958, a special civil action for <em>certiorari</em> was 
presented by the same Gabani, Orabiles, Obina and Obidos, petitioners, against 
Juan E. Reas and Luis F. Muñoz, as Justice of the Peace of Wright, respondents, 
in the CFI of Samar (Civ. Case No. 4631), reciting the proceedings in civil case 
No. 11 of the Justice of the Peace of Wright and alleging that the inferior 
court had exceeded its jurisdiction and gravely abused its discretion in 
condemning the petitioners to pay the respondents (1) damages in the sum of 
P200.00 plus rentals for P156.00; (2) P300.00 as attorney's fees; and in 
ordering the execution of the judgment, for their failure to put up the P500.00 
bond; that they have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary 
course of law to stop the execution of the decision handed down by the 
respondent court, other than the petition for certiorari, and that the complaint 
for illegal detainer was malicious, unfounded and fraudulent, thereby causing 
upon them mental anguish, painful anxiety, and fear of losing their rights and 
had compelled them to employ the services of a lawyer. They prayed, therefore, 
that (a) the decision of the Justice of the Peace court in civil case No. 11, be 
declared null and void; (b) that respondent Reas be condemned to pay petitioners 
the sum of P1,000.00 as moral damages, P300.00 as attorney's fees and costs. On 
November 30, 1957, respondents filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the 
following grounds;</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>That the petition stated no cause of action. 
</li><li>That respondent Justice of the Peace Court was vested with jurisdiction to 
take cognizance of Civil Case No. 11. 
</li><li>That the petitioners had the right of appeal in said civil case No. 11. 
</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>The motion to dismiss having been denied, respondents answered; alleged as 
their affirmative defenses, the same grounds contained in their motion to 
dismiss the petition, and set up a counterclaim. After due hearing, the CFI of 
Samar handed down a decision, the dispositive portion of which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, the Court renders judgment declaring the decision 
Exhibit F, rendered by the respondent Justice of the Peace in Civil Case No. 11, 
null and void; and condemning the respondent Juan E. Reas to pay to the 
petitioners damages of three hundred pesos and another three hundred pesos for 
attorney's fees, and the costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondents appealed to this Court and in their brief, submitted four errors 
alleged to have been committed by the trial court, but which may be reduced to 
one dominant proposition, to wit: Whether the trial court acted correctly in 
annulling the decision of the Justice of the Peace of Wright in civil case No. 
11, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The complaint in the justice of the peace court (Case No. 11) among others, 
alleges:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. That in May, 1956, defendants contracted with the plaintiff to plant rice 
and corn on the above properties, under the conditions of paying a yearly rental 
of 1½ sacks of palay and corn, valued P8.00 per sack of palay and P5.00 per sack 
of corn, and defendants forthwith began planting the said products and have been 
harvesting the same up to the present time, but without paying the agreed 
rentals, despite repeated demands.</p>
<p>4. That for such failure and refusal of the defendants as above stated or to 
vacate the land, the plaintiff has been forced to institute the present action 
incurring damages of more than P200.00 and attorney's fees of P300.00.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, it is hereby respectfully prayed that this Honorable Court may 
order the defendants to pay for each of these rentals in palay of 3 sacks and 3 
sacks also of corn for 1955 and 1956 valued in all P39.00 or P156.00 for all the 
four defendants, plus interest of 6% from the filing of this complaint, with 
costs against them; order them to vacate the land, and to pay damages of more 
than P200.00 and attorney's fees of P300.00; and extending to the plaintiff such 
other remedies fair and equitable in the premises" (Exhs. "9" and 
"A-1").</p></blockquote>
<p>Judging from the above averment, one may readily see that the case falls 
under the provisions of the Agricultural Tenancy Act No. 1199, approved on Aug. 
30, 1954, as amended by Act No. 1267, approved on June 14, 1954; the pertinent 
portions of which recite:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 4. <em>Systems of Agricultural Tenancy; Their 
definitions</em>—Agricultural Tenancy is classified into leasehold tenancy and 
share tenancy.</p>
<p><em>Share tenancy</em> * * *,</p>
<p><em>Leasehold Tenancy</em> , exists when a person who, either personally or 
with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, 
undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation 
by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household 
(belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a price 
certain or ascertainable to be paid by the person cultivating the land either in 
percentage of the production or in a fixed amount in money, or both.</p>
<p>SEC. 21. <em>Ejectment; Violation; Jurisdiction</em>.—All cases involving the 
dispossession of a tenant by the landholder or by a third party and/or the 
settlement and disposition of disputes arising from the relationship of 
landholder and tenant, as well as the violation of any of the provisions of this 
Act, shall be under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of such court as may 
now or hereinafter be authorized by law to take cognizance of tenancy relations 
and disputes". (Act No. 1199).</p>
<p>SEC. 7. <em>Jurisdiction of the Court</em>.—The Court shall have <em>original 
and exclusive jurisdiction</em> over the entire Philippines, to consider, 
investigate, decide, and settle <em>all</em> questions, matters, controversies, 
or disputes involving all those relationships established by law which determine 
the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land 
where one of the parties works the land, and shall have <em>concurrent 
jurisdiction</em> with the Court of First Instance over the employer and farm 
employees or labor under the Republic Act numbered Six Hundred Two (Minimum Wage 
Law), and over landlord and tenant involving violations of the Usury Law (Act No 
2655) as amended, and of inflicting the penalties provided therefor" (Act No. 
1267).</p></blockquote>
<p>The causes of action in the complaint describes a leasehold Tenancy; it is a 
case of dispossession or ejectment of a tenant by the landlord, of an 
agricultural land where the tenant cultivates or works the land, in 
consideration of a price certain paid by the one cultivating the land, 
consisting of so many sacks of rice and corn, for rentals. The above cited laws 
are clear and definite as to what court should take cognizance of disputes 
arising from such relationship. Section 21 aforequoted, says "all cases" 
involving the dispossession of tenant by the landholder "shall be under the 
original and exclusive jurisdiction of such court" as may be authorized by law 
to take cognizance of Tenancy relations and disputes; and such court, by virtue 
of sec. 7 aforequoted, which again provides that <em>all questions, matters, 
controversies or disputes</em> involving all the relationships established by 
law which determines the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use of 
agricultural land where one of the parties works the land, is the Court of 
Agrarian Relations (Santos, et al., <em>vs</em>. Vivas, et al., 96 Phil., 538; 
51 Off. Gaz., 690; Mendoza <em>vs</em>. Manguiat, 96 Phil., 309; 51 Off. Gaz., 
137; also Valencia , et al <em>vs</em>. Hon. J. T. Surtida, <em>sapra</em>, p. 
513).</p>
<p>Having reached the above conclusion, it would seem unnecessary to pass upon 
other minor issues raised by the respondents-appellants.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from is, therefore, affirmed, with costs against 
respondents-appellants.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Dizon, De Leon,</em> and <em>Natividad, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
