of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in R04-WC Case No.

seeking to recover disability compensation benefits against his employer, the

the nature of his work as driver physically disabling him for further work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To support his claim for compensation,
petitioner attached the Physician's Report of Sickness or Accident<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
accomplished by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Manuel of the Philippine
Tuberculosis Society at <span class="SpellE">Tayuman</span>, Manila, stating
therein that claimant Pedro Leonardo is definitely suffering from a moderately
advanced Pulmonary Tuberculosis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date month="8" day="5" year="1974"><span style="">August 5,
 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, private
respondent Luzon Brokerage Corporation <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
petitioner's claim, contending that claimant's illness is not compensable as it
did not arise out of the performance of his duties and not in the ordinary
course of his employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issues having been joined, the case was set by the Acting
Referee for conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant
submitted an affidavit to constitute as his evidence in chief while respondent
submitted its Motion to Dismiss, and thereupon, the Acting Referee rendered
decision on February 24, 1975 awarding the claimant the sum of P6,000.00 as
disability compensation benefits as well as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against this adverse decision, private respondent Luzon Brokerage
Corporation on <st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1975">March 18, 1975</st1:date>
filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission a Petition for Review of the

<span class="SpellE">Castelo</span> on <st1:date month="11" day="25" year="1975">November
 25, 1975</st1:date> reversed the Acting Referee's decision on the ground that
it found "practically nothing to satisfactorily show that he (Pedro
Leonardo) was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis in 1964."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Luzon Brokerage Corporation in its memorandum
submitted to this Court, anchors its opposition to the grant of compensation
benefits on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
petitioner's claim has prescribed; (2) there is no conclusive evidence that
petitioner (claimant) was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis in 1964 when he
ceased working, or that he contracted the said ailment in the course of his
employment with respondent; and (3) the law furnishes equal protection to both
petitioner and private respondent without distinction between the strong and
the weak.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apropos the first contention, private respondent maintains that
Sec. 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, explicitly prescribes
that claims for compensation benefits should be filed within two months from
the date of injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent says:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, it appears from the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Celestina</span> Leonardo, wife of the claimant Pedro Leonardo,
dated January 7, 1975, submitted in support of the instant claim, that Pedro
Leonardo was aware that he was suffering from tuberculosis when he had himself
examined sometime in 1958 (see par. 6 of the affidavit).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner herein filed his claim for
disability benefits for the said ailment which he discovered in 1958, only on <st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1974">May 27, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From 1958 to 1974 is a period of 16 long
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (T<span class="GramE">)here</span> is no question that
petitioner's claim for disability compensation benefits had long
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly <span class="SpellE">laches</span> had set in <span class="SpellE">controverting</span>
petitioner's cause into one of a stale demand.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Petitioner's claim may be
viewed at </span>another angle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
letter to the Chief Referee and Chief of Section of Regional <span style="">Office No. 4 of the Workmen's Compensation
Section dated August 1, 1964, addressed </span>to the respondent Luzon
Brokerage Corporation, it was reported by the said Chief Referee that the
claimant Pedro Leonardo (petitioner herein) contracted illness sometime in
June, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, <span style="">from June, 1964, when claimant contracted
illness to </span><st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1974"><span style="">May 27, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> when claimant filed his claim for disability
compensation benefits is roughly 10 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The claim has, therefore, prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Memorandum for Respondent Luzon Brokerage
Corporation, <span style="">pp. 79-80).</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent's
stance that petitioner's claim has prescribed is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Romero v. Workmen's Compensation and
Republic of the </u></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="">Philippines</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u><span style=""> (Bureau of Public Schools</span></u><span style="">), No. L-42617, June 30, 1977, 77 SCRA 482, </span>487,
<span style="">We ruled as without merit the Solicitor
General's contention that the filing by claimant of notice for compensation
beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of two months as
provided by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, was fatal
to the success of the claim; that said defense is not jurisdictional; and that
the statutory right </span>to <span style="">compensation
prescribes in ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing the
<u>Romero</u> case, <span class="GramE">We</span> reiterated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cañonero</u></span><u> v. Workmen's Compensation Commission and
Republic </u></span><u>of the </u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Philippines</u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u>
</u><u><span style="">(Bureau of Public Schools</span></u><span style="">), No. L-43880, February 28, 1978, 81 SCRA
713, 720, that the contention of respondent employer that the filing of the
claim for compensation only after the lapse of more than seven (7) years from
the time of disability or illness in violation of Section 24 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended was fatal to its </span>success <span style="">is, likewise, without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be underscored that pursuant to
Article 1144 (2) of the Civil Code, the compensation under the Workmen's
Compensation Act is a liability vested by statute which prescribes in 10 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When does the 10-year statutory period to file a <span style="">compensation claim under the Workmen's
Compensation Act commence?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question
was resolve in <u>Superior Concrete </u></span><u>Products, Inc. v. WCC and <span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Benoza</span></u>, No.
L-42020, March 31, 1978, 82 SCRA 270, 278, wherein We ruled that the ten-year
prescriptive period for compensation cases commences from the time the employee
is disabled to pursue his occupation by reason of illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="GramE">We</span> enunciated:</p>

<blockquote>"The claim for compensation benefits filed by private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Benoza</span> has not prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner asserts that inasmuch as the
claimant alleges that he became sick with pulmonary tuberculosis in February of
1963, the claim for compensation has long prescribed and the employee is guilty
of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> since the latter filed the claim for the
first time only in April of 1971.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although the herein claimant became ill in February of 1963,
however, it was only in March of 1967 when he became disabled from work, and
inasmuch as it is the employee's disability to pursue his occupation by reason
of illness which entitles him to compensation, <span class="SpellE">Benoza's</span>
cause of action accrued only in March of 1967, consequently, the filing of his
claim in April of 1971 was well within the ten-year prescriptive period for
compensation cases of this nature."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the Acting Referee correctly ruled in his
decision that Pedro Leonardo's claim for compensation benefits has not yet
prescribed for "the records show that the claimant's disability started on
<st1:date month="7" day="15" year="1964">July 15, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the claim on <st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1974">May 27, 1974</st1:date> is still within the 10-year
prescriptive period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Workmen's
Compensation is a substantial right created by statute, hence, the period of
prescription shall be 10 years in accordance with the provisions of the New
Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the claimant's
delay in the filing of the Notice and Claim is non-jurisdictional provided,
however, the respondent did not suffer by such delay or failure or when the
employer, his agent or representative had knowledge of the illness or
accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the
respondent cannot deny knowledge of claimant's disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the matter was allegedly
reported to the Luzon Brokerage Corporation especially when the claimant filed
an application for benefits with the SSS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's second argument that there is no conclusive
evidence that petitioner (claimant) was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis
in 1964 when he ceased working or that he contracted the said ailment in the
course of his employment with respondent is, likewise, unmeritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of this case indubitably reveal
that petitioner Pedro Leonardo had been in the employ of the Luzon Brokerage
Corporation as driver for more than thirty (30) years from 1930 to 1964 before
the disease of pulmonary tuberculosis caught up with him and rendered him
incapacitated and disabled for further work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was barely thirty years of age when he started working for respondent
Corporation, a well-established and successful brokerage firm under able
management, which had under its employ about 750 employees who must have
undergone medical and physical examination previous to their employment and an
annual check-up thereafter, including the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the services of
petitioner had been interrupted during his employment with the respondent
Corporation for over three decades.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is evidence that as far back as 1958, when Leonardo was still
working as driver of respondent Corporation, he began complaining about his
condition of missing his regular meals on time, getting hungry because of it,
the dust he inhaled while driving which caused him to cough, the intense heat
of the sun at noontime and the cold biting wind during rainy season especially
when he got wet, and after having himself examined by a doctor, he was found to
be suffering from TB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medical
evidence given by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> B. Manuel of the
Philippine Tuberculosis Society in his Physician's Report clearly and
positively stated that claimant Pedro Leonardo was definitely suffering from a
moderately advanced pulmonary tuberculosis and that his illness could be
aggravated by his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's assertion that compensability does not lie
as there was no showing that claimant was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis
when he was separated from the service is flimsy and weak when We consider that
tuberculosis is not an instantaneous disease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is an imperceptible disease that is breathed in and feeds on the
lungs and taken with food; its presence in the body cannot easily be discerned;
its incipient stage may not be readily discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is medically accepted that exposure to
dust and dirt is a predisposing cause of tuberculosis and tends to produce
fibrosis of the lungs which weakens the resistance to any latent tuberculosis
infection and reactivates that infection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company v. Perez
and WCC, L-19522, August 31, 1964, 11 SCRA 797 and Lorenzo v. WCC and
Philippine Glass Manufacturing Co., Inc., L-42631, January 31, 1978, 81 SCRA
430, 440).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The causal connection between
his ailment and the nature of his employment as driver is thus easily
discernible, from which can be concluded that his illness supervened in the
course of such employment and was directly caused or either aggravated by or
was the result of such employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find substantial evidence to this effect from the Physician's Report signed by
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Manuel and the Medical Report of the
Social Security System.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, where there
exists some doubt as to whether claimant's illness, pulmonary tuberculosis,
arose out of or was aggravated by his employment, such doubt for the purpose of
carrying out the <span class="SpellE">beneficient</span> intentions of the
Workmen's Compensation <span class="GramE">Act,</span> should be resolved in
favor of the claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must once
again emphasize the principle that in testing the evidence on the relation
between the injury or disease and the employment, probability and not certainty
is the touchtone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And well-established
is the rule articulated by this Court numerous Workmen's Compensation cases
decided by Us that under the presumption of compensability established by the
Act, the burden of proving non-compensability of the employee's illness rests
on the employer, which in the </span>case<span style="">
at bar, respondent </span>Corporation <span style="">has
utterly failed to do by substantial evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the decision of
the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission contrary to the evidence and
to the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <span class="GramE">We</span> set aside the
decision of the respondent Commission and affirm the Acting Referee's Award
with modification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private
