				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier appeals on points of law
from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Antique, in election contest
Case No. 3-63 of said Court, declaring the deceased Felix <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span>
as having received a plurality of votes for the office of Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique, as against <span class="SpellE">contestee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier, and declaring the Vice-Mayor elect,
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span>, entitled
to assume the office in view of the death of the protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May </span>17, 1966,
the Municipal Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique,
certified that in the general elections held on November 12, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier had received 1,203 votes, the plurality of
the votes cast for Municipal Mayor according to the election returns, and
thereby proclaimed him Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felix <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span>, having obtained the second place with 1,150
votes, on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1966</st1:date>,
protested against the election of <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his motion of protest, <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span>
impugned the result of the election in Precinct No. 4, <span class="SpellE">CuIasi</span>,
Antique, alleging as grounds the commission of errors or irregularities by the
Board of Election Inspectors; erroneous appreciation of ballots, and improper
adjudication of votes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span style="">Javier </span>in due time filed his answer and counter-­protest,
wherein he impugned the result of the election in <span style="">Pre­</span>cincts Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 24,
25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35 and 36, alleging as ground the commis­sion of
errors or irregularities by the Board of Election Inspec­tors; erroneous
appreciation of ballots, and improper adjudica­tion of votes in the counter-protested
precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise alleged that
the ballots in the counter-protested precincts, ex­cept the ballots in the
ballot box of Precinct No. 4, were burned pursuant to Section 157 of the
Revised Election Code, when the ballot boxes were used in the elections of
November, 1965; and that he would present evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>
to prove the allegations in the counter-protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly before the case was first set for hearing on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1966</st1:date>, and before any
evidence could be adduced in the hearing of the protest, the <span style="">protestant </span><span style="">met an untimely death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, through counsel, moved to dismiss the protest on
<st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 1, 1966, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span> who was elected
Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique, filed a motion to
intervene and/or for substitution, alleging that he would be entitled to the
office in the event the protestant would prevail over the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
in ac­cordance with Section 7 of Republic Act 2264.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
opposed this motion to intervene and/or for substitution, alleg­ing that
Vice-mayor Pablo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span>
has no right to intervene under the provisions of Section 176(g) of the Revised
Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1966</st1:date>, the trial court denied <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> motion to dismiss the protest and allowed
Vice-mayor Paolo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span>
to intervene in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1966</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> filed a motion for reconsideration of the Order
denying his motion to dismiss and allowing the vice-mayor to intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion for reconsideration was denied on
<st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On order of the trial court, the commissioner opened the ballot
box of Precinct No. 4 on <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="10">October 11,
 1966</st1:date>, and rendered its report.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears from the report of the commissioners that 83 ballots were
claimed by Felix <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span>, and 17 ballots were
claimed by <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> Javier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the 83 ballots claimed by <span class="SpellE">Lonug­dang</span>, 46 were admitted and 37 were objected to by the
<span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> withdrew his
objections to 3 ballots, leaving 34 ballots objected to by the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">protestee</span></span><span class="GramE">, which
were</span> marked as Exhibits J-1 to J-34.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of the 17 ballots claimed by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
none was objected to by the protestant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 24, 1966, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
Vice-Mayor Pablo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span>
moved for the dismissal of the counter protest, on the ground that all the
ballots in the counter protested precincts, except those in Precinct No. 4,
have been burned pursuant to Section 157 of the Revised Election Code, and that
evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> is not admissible to prove
the allegations in the counter protest, since the burning of the ballots was
done without the intervention or fault of either party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
opposed the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> motion to dismiss the
counter protest, for the reason that in said counter-protest, he impugned the
correctness of the certificate of canvass and the correctness of the election
returns in twenty-two (22) precincts; and that the ballots in the counter
protested precincts, except those in Precinct No. 4, having been burned in
accordance with law, he is entitled to prove by tes­timony of the individual
voters that they have voted for the <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span>, in
numbers exceeding those returned by the inspectors as having cast their votes
for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> in the counter pro­tested
precincts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of November 14, 1966, the trial court deferred <span style="">resolution on </span>the
motion to dismiss the counter protest, and re­scheduled the hearing of the
protest and counter-protest for Nov­ember 22, 1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 22, 1966, the court ordered the
election returns marked (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. L-1 to L-18), and
commissioned the Clerk of Court to receive them, after which the Court would
resolve whether or not to allow the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to
introduce evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> consisting of the
testimony of the voters, and should the Court resolve to deny said motion, then
the whole case would be deemed submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 15, 1966, the trial Court denied
the petition of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to present evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> in connection with the precincts involved in
the counter protest, and considered the case submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of January 26, 1967, the Court declared the
protestant, Felix <span class="SpellE">Lomugdang</span>, the duly elected
Municipal Mayor <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Culasi</span></span><span style="">, </span>Antique in
the elections of November 12, 1963, with a plurality of seven (7) votes over
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
Javier, and held Vice-Mayor Pablo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span> entitled to the office.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> appealed to the Court of
Appeals, from that decision the lower court of January 26, 1967; the order of
December 15, 1966; dismissing the counter-protest, the order of January 6,
1967, denying the motion for reconsideration of that order of December 15, and
from the order of January 20, 1967, not giv­ing due course to the appeal from
the orders of December 15, 1966 and January 6, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, however, cer­tified the
case to this Court, the issues involved there a being purely of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant filed his
brief, in August, 1967, but all parties prayed this Court to decide the case as
early as possible, thereby submitting the case for decision without the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Javier in his brief assigns the following alleged
errors:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.8in; text-indent: -0.5in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">I.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The trial court erred in not dismissing the
protest upon the death of the protestant before the hearing of the protest,
there having been no show­ing as yet that the election of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> is void or that the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
had not obtained <span style="">the </span>majority of
votes in the elections held on November 12, 1963.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.8in; text-indent: -0.5in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">II.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The trial court erred in not allowing the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to offer evidence <span class="SpellE">aliunde</span>
to prove the allegations in his counter-protest -- the ballots in the twenty-two
counter-protested precincts, except the ballots of Precinct No. 4, having been
burned pursuant to Section 157, Revised Election Code -- and, in effect,
dismissed the counter-­protest.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.8in; text-indent: -0.5in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">III.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The trial court erred in allowing Vice-Mayor
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span> to
intervene in the case.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The trial court erred in declaring the pro­testant
elected Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Culasi</span>, Antique, in the
elections held on <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first and third assignments refer to the same issue and can
be discussed together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Determination of
what candidate has been in fact elected is a matter clothed with public
interest, <span class="GramE">wherefore,</span> public policy demands that an
election contest, duly commenced, be not abated by the death of the
contestant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have squarely so ruled <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Sibulo</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">De</span> <span style="">Mesa </span><span style="">vs. </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span></u>, G. R. No.
L-24583, October 29, 1966, in the same spirit that led this Court to hold that
the <span style="">ineligibility of the protestant is </span>not
a defense (Caesar vs. <span class="SpellE">Garrido</span>, 53 Phil. 97), and that
the <span class="SpellE">protestee's</span> cessation in office is not a ground
for the dismissal of the contest nor detract the Court's jurisdic­tion to
decide the case (Angeles vs. Rodriguez, 46 Phil. 595; <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
<span style="">vs. </span>Hernandez, 62 Phil. 584).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same <span class="SpellE"><u>Sibulo</u></span> case, already
cited, this Court likewise ruled that by virtue of Section 7 of Republic Act
2264, the vice-mayor elect has the status of a real party in interest in the
con­tinuation of the proceedings and is entitled to intervene therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if the protest succeeds and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> is unseated, the vice-mayor succeeds to the
office of mayor that becomes vacant if the one duly elected can not assume the
post.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, no error was committed by the Court below in allow­ing
Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Alolod</span> to intervene in the protest at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appel­lant's first and third
assignments of error must be and are over­ruled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue is whether the Court below should have per­mitted
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant's offer of evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> (consisting of the testimony of the voters
themselves) to support the counter-protest against the official returns in some
22 precincts, because the ballots cast therein were burned after three months,
conformably to section 157 of the Revised Election Code (R. A. No. 180, as
amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
rejected this offer for the reason that to allow the voters in said precincts
(some 4,000 in all) to reveal the names of the candidates for whom they voted
would amount to holding another election.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no error <span style="">in </span>the resolution of the trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of previous incidents in this case
that had to be resolved by this Court (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-22248, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 30, 1965</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; G. R. No.</span> L?<span style="">24747,
</span>February 28, 1966) hearings on the merits of the protest did not start
until October 1966, and it is easy to see that the presentation of the 4,000
witnesses in support of the counter­-protest would have brought the hearings to
unmanageable pro­portions and prolonged the trial even beyond the end of 1967,
when the term for which the <span style="">candidates </span>were
to hold office would expire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, had the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>-appellant acted
with due diligence and notified the municipal treasurer in due time of his
intended counter-protest, the destruction of the ballots of the affected
precincts would have been avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> could have done so, for only he was in
a position to know what precincts would be the subject of his counter <span class="GramE">protest.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">All in all, we perceive here an obvious
design of appellant for protracted delay that could not and should not receive
either en­couragement or sanction from the Courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant relies on <span class="SpellE"><u>Salvani</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Garduno</span></u>,
52 Phil. 673, 679, </span>as authority for the admissibility of the testimony
of the electors for the purpose of impeaching the returns when the ballots are
shown to have been destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <span class="SpellE"><u>Salvani</u></span> case involved only one precinct, while in
the present case, appellant wished to introduce the testimony of the electors
in practically all the precincts of the municipality, a procedure that for the
reasons previously <span class="GramE">given,</span> is improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly remarked by the Court below, it
would amount to holding practically a new election, without the secrecy that
public policy considers as essential to the electors' freedom of choice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the decision
appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the proximity of the next elections, this decision shall
become final within five (5) days from notice to the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellant.</span></p>
