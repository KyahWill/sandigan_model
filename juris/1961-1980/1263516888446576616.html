being held in extended celebration of All Saints' Day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">cockfighting and a "<span class="SpellE">hantak</span>" game
was being played.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the players in
the said game was the late <span class="SpellE">Laureto</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Laurito</span>) <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witness for the prosecution, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on, who was about two (2) meters away from where the
"<span class="SpellE">hantak</span>" game was being played (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., page 31), saw accused <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> at both sides of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness narrated what happened moments
later, as follows:</p>

<span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span>, do you know what he was doing at that time?</blockquote>

there?</blockquote>

in the "<span class="SpellE">hantak</span>" game I saw him stood up and
counted his money; and, it was at that time that this Lim <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>
slapped him with the back of his palm at his face and with his left hand
delivered a thrust to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Laurito</span> was
hit (witness was pointing to the left side of his body his hand up; next he
made a motion jerking up) and then <span class="SpellE">Peoley</span> stabbed him
at the right side of the body (witness pointing to the right side of his body
below the armpit).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Peoley</span> stabbed him, Lim stabbed him by the left hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> You said that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After he was stabbed, <span class="SpellE">Laurito</span> <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span> ran away, with <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> in
pursuit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span>
collapsed after running a distance of ten meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> kicked him
in the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on, who was a friend of <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>,
entreated the latter to stop kicking <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span> as he
was already dead, but <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> tried to stab <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on instead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> saw that <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span>
was dead, accused left the place and went home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The people scampered away
even as <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> brandished his bloody bolo and
challenged everyone to a fight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Policeman <span class="SpellE">Hospecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pausal</span>
happened to be in the marketplace at the time, serving <u>subpoena</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was attracted by the commotion and, seeing
<span class="SpellE">Olimpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> carrying a
bolo covered with blood, fired a shot in the air and commanded <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> to put down his weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> did as
commanded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pausal</span>
brought him to the municipal building and turned him over to the guard on duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Policeman <span class="SpellE">Pausal</span> inspected the body of <span class="SpellE">Laurito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span> and found at the left side a sharp-pointed
bolo, with the blade partly drawn from its scabbard about two (2) inches, and
an Indian slingshot in the right pocket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The municipal health
officer of <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span>, Dr. Henry Y. <span class="SpellE">Dullin</span>, performed a post-mortem examination of the cadaver
of <span class="SpellE">Laureto</span> <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span> at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="8"><span style="">eight o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> that evening and found the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the nipple about 4 inches in length, deep penetrating which injured the heart,
lung and great blood vessels around the heart and lungs;</blockquote>

eminence;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>abrasion over the forehead, bridge of the
nose and left cheek." (Exhibit "A")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As this appeal pertains only to <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span>, we shall limit this review to his case,
skipping the version of his co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Olimpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant’s defense is <u>alibi</u>, claiming that at the
time of the com­mission of the crime, in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11">14 November 1963</st1:date>, he was not at <span class="SpellE">Mobod</span> but at <st1:place>Upper <span class="SpellE">Lamak</span></st1:place>,
about one and a half to two kilometers away, to gather tuba from 17 coconut
trees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that the testimony of prosecution witness
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on is unreliable because while he recognized
the weapon used by <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> the witness was not clear
on the weapon used by appellant <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This uncertainty as to the kind of weapon
used does not necessarily impair his reliability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a wound just below the left nipple
of the deceased, while two wounds existed at the right side of his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These wounds tally with <span class="SpellE">Bati-on's</span>
testimony that <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> inflicted one wound at the
left and the knife came out at the right side, and that the second wound at the
right side of the victim was inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bati-on's</span>
non-recognition of the weapon used by <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> does
not alter the fact that the latter did use a weapon to produce the wound
described.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do we find that this eyewitness acted through improper
motives, the charge of personal enmity by the accused not being adequately
supported.</p>

<p class="BODY">A defense witness, <span class="SpellE">AnseImo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahawan</span>, testified that, as a member of the police force at
the time of the stabbing, he was designated to look for witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the scene of the crime, saw the
mother of the deceased crying over her son, and asked her about the companion
of her son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother pointed to
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Mahawan</span> inquired from <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>­-on
what he knew about the incident, <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on denied
knowledge of anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony of
defense witness <span class="SpellE">Mahawan</span> was <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>;
but while the fact that <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on denied any knowledge
about the crime soon after its commission before the investigating policeman
reduces the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Bati</span>-on, such diminution
is not substantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not unusual
for witnesses at first refusing to be involved in a criminal proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witness disclosed what he knew about the
incident shortly thereafter, on <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="11">16
 November 1963</st1:date>, when he signed a statement taken from him by the
police at the municipal building; gave additional answers to interrogations by
the municipal Judge; and swore to the truth thereof on <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="11">17 November 1963</st1:date> (CFI Criminal Case Rec.
Wrapper, page 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sworn statement
was not offered in evidence, but it forms part of the record of the preliminary
investigation conducted by the municipal judge and can be taken judicial notice
of by both the trial court and the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Bautista, 60 Phil. 1026)</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be resorted to by
an accused (People vs. De la Cruz, 76 Phil. 701).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish it, the accused must show that
he was at some other place for such a period of time that it was impossible for
him to have been at the place where the crime was committed at the time of its
commission (U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Oxiles</span>, 20 Phil. 587; People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Palomos</span>, 49 Phil. 601; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Resabal</span>, 50 Phil. 780).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These requisites accused-appellant failed to establish; he did not even
show how long he stayed in <st1:place>Upper <span class="SpellE">Lamak</span></st1:place>,
which was only two kilometers away from the <span class="SpellE">Mobod</span>
market place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> props his defense of
<u>alibi</u> with the fact that prosecution witness, policeman <span class="SpellE">Hospecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pausal</span>, did not see said
appellant in the market place when he apprehended <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>
after the stabbing incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
appellant was not seen by <span class="SpellE">Pausal</span> may be explained by
the fact that appellant <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> had left the place
when he <span style="">saw that <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span>
was already dead, and the patrolman's attention was concentrated on <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> who was challenging all and sundry while
brandishing a bolo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution did not prove any motive of appellant <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span> for committing the crime, but lack of motive does
not preclude conviction of the offense when the crime and the participation of
the accused are definitely proved, as was done in this case (People v. <span class="SpellE">Tanco</span>, 58 Phil. 255; People v. <span class="SpellE">Reyno</span>,
L-19071, 30 April 1965; People v. <span class="SpellE">Villalba</span>, L-17243,
23 August 1966, 17 SCRA 948).</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is murder, qualified by treachery,
established by the sudden and unexpected attack upon the victim by the two
accused, who situated themselves on both sides of the deceased and rendered the
victim unable to defend himself (U. S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Castellon</span>,
12 Phil. 160; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Macarinfas</span>, 40 Phil.
1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abuse of superior strength also
attended the com­mission of the crime, but this circumstance is absorbed in
treachery (People v. <span class="SpellE">Limaco</span>, 88 Phil. 35; People v. <span class="SpellE">Ruzol</span>, et al., 100 Phil. 537).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General admits that the prosecution failed to prove
evident premeditation (Brief, page 10).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We agree; and we, likewise, find no mitigating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Murder is penalized by "reclusion temporal in its maximum
period to death" (Article 248, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no aggravating or mitigating
circumstance, the penalty should have been imposed in its medium period, which
is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The errors of the trial court in the imposition of the penalties,
based on its own findings, are at once noticeable; for, having declared <span class="SpellE">Olimpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>guilty of murder, with the
aggravating circumstances of recidivism and superior strength (Nos. 9 &amp; 15,
Article 14, Revised Penal Code), without any mitigating circumstance, the court
imposed the minimum penalty for murder, <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
instead of the maximum, which is death, and misapplied Article 64, paragraph 6,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the code, on the wrong assumption that the maximum penalty for murder is the
maximum period of <u>reclusion</u> <u><span style="">temporal</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
for <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span>,
the court imposed upon him a penalty one degree lower because, after stabbing
the victim, he fled from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flight may indicate guilt,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but certainly, it is not a reward for
committing a crime nor a mitigation of criminal responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the simultaneity of the
attacks and the strategy of assailing the deceased from both sides fully
establish cons­piracy and common intent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Not the least of its
errors, also on the face of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of its decision, is the trial court's imposition of compensatory damages in the
amount of P3,000.00 for the death of the victim (P1,500.00 from each of the two
accused).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision was promulgated
on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="12"><span style="">12 December 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, but the then existing jurisprudence (since 1948, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amansec</span>, 80 Phil. 424) fixed the amount of indemnification
at P6,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount was later raised
to P12,000.00 in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, L-18793, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="10"><span style="">11</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">October 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Normally, co-conspirators
of a crime are held jointly and severally liable in the amount of P12,000.00,
by way of indemnification for the death of their victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But here, the trial court condemned <span class="SpellE">Olimpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> to pay only
P1,500.00, and the decision with respect to him has become final when his
appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeals at his own request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question, therefore, arises:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>how much should the co-conspirator, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumantas</span>, the herein
remaining appellant, be made to pay?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe that, in justice to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Laurito</span> <span class="SpellE">Limpahan</span>, he should pay an indemnity of P12,000.00, but
with the right to demand contribution from his co-accused in the sum of
P1,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it may appear that this
award is to some extent Unfair to this appellant, it is a necessary consequence
of the withdrawal of Badiang's appeal, which rendered final the low indemnity
awarded by the court below (erroneous though it should be), and above all, to
the need of doing justice to the heirs of the victim, whose right to adequate
indemnification is paramount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">FOR THE FOREGOING
REASONS</span></b><span style="">, the appealed
