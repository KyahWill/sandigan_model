co-petitioner-appellant Miguel Solis who </span>had constructed therein <span style="">man-made canals </span>and fishpond dikes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">17, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Lucia <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> wrote <span style="">a </span>letter-complaint to the Secretary of
Public Works stating that several fishpond operators and/or own­ers in <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
have built dams across and closed the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabatan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span style="">a </span>public navigable stream, thereby
depriving her and the residents therein of passageway, fishing ground and water
supply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter-complaint <span style="">was </span>for­mally amended on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="6">June <span style="">9,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>wherein
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> specified appellants <span class="SpellE">Taleon</span>
and Solis, and another neighbor, one <span class="SpellE">Humberto</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>, as
those responsible for the clos­ing of the alleged <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabatan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
on the banks of which their lands abutted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="6">June <span style="">13, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Taleon</span> filed her answer denying the existence of the
alleged river and c<span style="">laiming </span>that
the dams were constructed inside her registered property and that her water
source was a man-made canal connected to the sea.</p>

<p class="BODY">An administrative hearing <span style="">was
</span>thereafter held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="7"><span style="">July 11,
 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the
Secretary of Public Works, through the department undersecretary, rendered a
decision finding that appellants were indeed obstructing the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabatan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a public navigable stream which used to pass inside their lands, with the dams
they constructed thereon, and ordering <span style="">their
demolition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants filed a motion to
reconsider <span style="">claiming </span>that the
ruling was contrary to the facts established and that the Secretary had no
jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants elevated the
case to the Office of the President on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October 11, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">After reviewing the records, <span style="">said </span>office affirmed on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="11"><span style="">November
 10, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> the decision
of </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="7"><span style="">July 11, </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Appellants filed a motion to re­consider
based on an alleged decision of Public Works Secretary Moreno rendered on
November </span><span style="">24, 1961, </span><span style="">reversing the former ruling of July 11, </span><span style="">1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On January 10, </span><span style="">1962, </span>the <span style="">Office of the
President denied the motion, on two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) An official <span style="">examination </span>of
the records of </span>the <span style="">case showed
that said decision of Secretary Moreno </span>did not form <span style="">part thereof, and (2) even if it were
genuine, </span>it <span style="">had no legal effect
since the Secretary had already </span>lost <span style="">jurisdiction when appellants filed their appeal to </span>the <span style="">President.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="2"><span style="">February </span><span style="">9, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Taleon</span></span><span style=""> was informed by the Dis­trict Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
that her dams would be demolished </span>on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="2">February <span style="">16, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>upon orders of the Executive Secretary,
<span style="">the administrative decision having
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To stop the threatened demolition, appellants
filed suit in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
against </span>the Public <span style="">Works
Secretary and the Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They </span>were able to obtain a writ of <span style="">preliminary injunction on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February
 </span><span style="">15, 1962</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="9"><span style="">September
 1, </span><span style="">1962</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">appellants filed a similar pe­tition </span>for certiorari and
prohibition with preliminary in­junction against the herein respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in the Court of First <span style="">Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the <span class="SpellE">latters</span>' respective </span>answers were filed and the case
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
was dismissed, upon appellants' <span style="">motion,
said </span><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place><span style=""> court issued </span>the writ of preliminary
injunction prayed for, <span class="SpellE">altho</span> in form a temporary
restraining order with <span style="">bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issues having been
joined, a pre-trial conference </span>was held and the Court of First Instance
of Manila allowed respondents to file a motion to dismiss the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon orders of said court, the administrative
re­cords were sent up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 11, <span style="">1965, </span>acting on the respective
memoranda submitted by the parties in support of and in opposition to the
pending motion to dismiss, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span><span style="">ruled that appellants </span>were
given a fair hearing <span style="">in </span>the
administrative case and that the decision therein was supported by the evidence
adduced and dismissed the petition, stating:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding merit in the respondents' Motion to
Dismiss, GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let this petition be,
as it is hereby, DISMISSED, with costs against petitioners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The temporary restraining order issued on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="12">17 December 1962</st1:date> is hereby dissolved
and the bond filed by petitioners, cancelled."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Taking issue with this
ruling, the petitioners instituted the present appeal, raising questions purely
of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They submit that the court <u>a</u>
<u>qu</u></span><u><span style="">o</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">erred in dismissing the
case without giving them trial, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to
prove that the alleged extension of the <span class="SpellE">Cabatan</span> River
passing across their property is but a depression and that the decision ren­dered
by Secretary Moreno on November 24, 1961, is genuine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants also reiterate that the Secretary
of Public Works has no jurisdiction over the case, since the dams and the body
of water in question were located inside registered private property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants' contentions </span><span style="">are without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, a full trial was not
needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues raised before the
court <u>a</u></span><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">all </span><span style="">purely legal and thus
could be resolved on the </span><span style="">bas</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">s </span><span style="">of the pleadings and memoranda filed and the </span><span style="">administrative </span><span style="">records sent up to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No necessity
</span><span style="">was </span><span style="">there for further reception of evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the jurisdiction of
the Secretary of Public </span><span style="">Works, </span>this
point has been squarely covered in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lovina</span></u></span><u><span style=""> v</span></u><u><span style="">. </span>Moreno</u>,
L-17821, <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="11">November 29, <span style="">1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>There We upheld the power <span style="">of </span>the Public Works Secretary under Republic
Act <span style="">2056 </span>to declare as <span style="">a </span>public <span style="">navigable </span>stream any alleged
depressions or bodies of water even inside titled properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case involved a creek, located inside <span style="">a </span>titled
land, which was alleged to be <span style="">privately
</span>owned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Public Works Secretary
declared it as part of a public stream which plaintiffs therein had blocked
with their dams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sustaining the
Secretary, We there ruled that such fact-finding power on his part was merely <u><span style="">incidental</span></u> to his duty to clear
all navigable streams of unauthorized obstructions and, hence, its grant did
not constitute an unlawful delegation of judicial power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And We remarked there that although the title
was silent as to the <span style="">exis</span>tence
of any stream inside the property, that did not confer a right to the stream,
it being of a public nature <span style="">and not </span>subject
<span style="">to private appropriation, even </span>by
prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants would offer
affidavits - which are hear say</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and testimonies </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">aliunde</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">show that the alleged </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cabatan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> inside their property is really a mere depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As also enunciated in </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lovina</span></u></span><u><span style=""> v. Moreno</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">supra, however, there
cannot be a trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> in cases of this </span>nature, since a
review of an <span style="">administrative </span>finding
is limited to the evidence already presented before the administrative body.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This rule bars presentation of evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>
and limits the trial court's functions to determining whether there is evidence
in the administrative records substantial enough to support the findings
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the records of the
administrative case were actually brought up and submitted to the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>and
it held that the administrative finding that the alleged depression <span style="">was really a </span>part
of the navigable <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabatan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> was supported by substantial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said court fully <span style="">did its </span>duty;
to have gone further would have been exceeding its power.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the alleged second decision of the Secretary, <span style="">its </span>non-existence
has been officially certified by the Chief of the Records Division of the
Department of Public Works, the official custodian.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This alone is proof enough that there is no such decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
<u><span style="">But even granting that there is
really such a decision</span></u><span style="">, </span>it
would not help appellants' cause any.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said decision would still be <span style="">wanting
</span>of legal force and effect since Secretary Moreno had already lost
jurisdiction to revoke the former ruling because of the appeal then already
taken by appellants themselves to the Office of the President, which affirmed
the former ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even conceding
jurisdiction, the second decision could still affect nothing since it was
actually revoked and reversed by the ruling of the Office of the President,
dated <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1962</st1:date>,
which denied the motion to reconsider filed by appellants wherein they invoked
said new decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, <span style="">a </span><span style="">full trial </span>to
prove the authenticity of the <st1:city><st1:place>Moreno</st1:place></st1:city>
decision would be a pointless waste of the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">quo's</span></u><span style=""> </span>time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is recognized that the trial court may dismiss a <span style="">p</span>etition for certiorari even after an
answer is filed upon a motion to dismiss, where said petition is found to be
patently without merit.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
But the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">q</span></u><u><span style="">uo</span></u><span style=""> </span>did not <u>sum</u><u><span style="">marily</span></u><span style=""> </span>dismiss the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It conducted a pre-trial conference and even
ordered the records in the administrative case to be elevated to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
authorizes the trial court to render judgment on the <span style="">p</span>leadings or a summary judgment, as justice may require, if at
the pre-trial it finds that facts exist which would warrant such judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the necessary facts being already before
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, no further trial was required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its decision rendered<span style=""> </span>at that stage was there­fore sanctioned by the Rules.</p>
