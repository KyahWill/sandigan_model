THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MUÑOZ PALMA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>, was a
Senior Librarian of respondent National Library who on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1975</st1:date>, filed a claim for compensation
with the Workmen's Compensation Commission, Department of Labor, for his
illness of pulmonary tuberculosis which caused him to stop working since <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's claim was denied by the Regional
Office No. 4 in a communication dated <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="8">August
 21, 1975</st1:date>, on the ground that the alleged illness of the claimant
was "not directly caused or either aggravated by the nature of your
employment with respondent" the National Library.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 20, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">A letter dated <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1975</st1:date>, was sent by petitioner praying that his case be reopened
and that he be given the opportunity to present his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 21, ibid.) The Assistant Chief of Section
of Regional Office No. 4 in an order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1976</st1:date>, denied the reconsideration for lack of
merit, and elevated the record of the case to the Workmen's Compensation
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1976</st1:date>, signed by Associate
Commissioners Dr. <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>-Sotto
and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagmit</span>, Jr.,
the order of dismissal of the claim of petitioner was affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 25-26, ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this Petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admitting that petitioner and respondent employer were not given the
opportunity of presenting their respective evidence at a formal hearing, the
Solicitor General in his Comment filed for and in behalf of the respondents,
recommends that this case be remanded to the Secretary of Labor who took over
the functions of the defunct Workmen's Compensation Commission, for further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, however, that on the basis of the pleadings before Us
the Court can decide on petitioner's claim and terminate the matter here and
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law being in favor of
petitioner, humane reasons aimed at promoting justice and the general welfare
of the working man justify the rendition of a decision on the merits at this
stage rather than the return of the case to the Secretary of Labor for further
proceedings as suggested by the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The niceties and refinements of technical
rules on procedure must give way to effect substantial justice to the herein
petitioner-claimant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents admit that petitioner was employed with respondent
National Library, Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and that he stopped working on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1974</st1:date>, due to pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this, We quote from respondents' Comment:</p>

<blockquote>"The records and personal file of petitioner with
respondent-employer National Library are more than sufficient to establish
petitioner's claim that he stopped working on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1974</st1:date> due to his ailment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Daily Time Record shows absence from work
at the National Library on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="7">July 30,
 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certified true copies
of petitioner's Daily Time Record are hereto attached as Annex 1 hereof; the
precise date of petitioner's absence on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1974</st1:date> having been marked as Annex 1-A." (p. 39, ibid.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the illness of petitioner cannot indeed be disputed
as it was diagnosed by Dr. Tomas C. Morales of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Institute as per Physician's Report to be <u>moderately advanced pulmonary
tuberculosis, bilateral</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 22,
ibid.) Petitioner's confinement at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Institute is likewise confirmed by the "Medicare Benefits Voucher"
dated <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1974</st1:date>,
covering petitioner's hospitalization from <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1974</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="9">September
 17, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 23, ibid.) The
Physician's Report shows that as of <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="4"><u>April
 11, 1975</u></st1:date> petitioner herein was still undergoing treatment for
his advanced pulmonary tuberculosis and was incapacitated to return to work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having knowledge of the illness of petitioner and of the fact
that the latter stopped reporting to the Office as of July 30, 1974, it was
incumbent upon respondent employer to file with the Workmen's Compensation
Commission a notice of the employee's illness (Sec. 37 of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, Act 3428 as amended) and controvert the right to compensation
either, on or before the fourteenth day of disability or within ten days after
it had knowledge of the alleged illness (Sec. 45, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to comply with the foregoing requirements
of the law, respondent employer renounced its right to controvert the claim of
petitioner, and perforce is obligated to compensate the latter for his
disabling illness.</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Grounds for compensation</u>.- When an
employee suffers personal injury from any accident arising out of and in the
course of his employment, or contracts tuberculosis or other illness directly
caused by such employment, or either aggravated by or the result of the nature
of such employment, his employer shall pay compensation in the sums and to the
persons hereinafter specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Workmen's Compensation
Act, Act No. 3428, as amended)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Compensation, how payable</u>.- x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If the employer or insurance
carrier does not controvert the injured workman's right to compensation, such
employer or insurance carrier shall, either on or before the fourteenth day
after disability or within five days after the employer first has knowledge of
the accident, begin paying compensation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ." (Act 3428, as amended)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a host of cases, among the latest of which are <span class="SpellE"><u>Arzadon</u></span><u> vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission</u>
and <u>Republic of the Philippines</u>, L-42404, December 8, 1976, and <span class="SpellE"><u>Catibog</u></span><u>, et. al. vs. Workmen's Compensation
Commission and Republic of the Philippines</u>, L-43416, December 8, 1976, this
Court held that failure to controvert results in the loss of non-jurisdictional
defenses and an ultimate admission of compensability.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent employer cannot escape liability by asserting that no
notice was given by petitioner of his claim for compensation, for failure to
give such notice assuming that there was no such notice, is not a bar to the
proceedings for compensation if <u>it is shown that the employer had knowledge of
the illness</u>, and such was the case here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 27, Workmen's Compensation Act)</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent National Library had, at the most, ten days from July
30, 1974, the date when its employee Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Justo</span>
ceased to work, within which to controvert the employee's right to
compensation; having neglected to do so, it must suffer the consequences
expressly provided for in the law and which time and again have been
emphatically stressed by this Court as indicated above.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of Regional Office No. 4, which was affirmed by
respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission, that the illness of Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> was not directly caused or aggravated by the nature
of the employment with respondent National Library runs counter to the
presumption established in Sec. 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, that in
the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, a claim comes within the
provisions of the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tuberculosis is not an instantaneous disease; it is an imperceptible
disease caused by a germ which is breathed into and feeds on the lungs or taken
with food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is medically accepted that
exposure to dust and dirt is a predisposing cause of tuberculosis and tends to
produce fibrosis of the lungs which weakens resistance to any latent
tuberculosis infection and reactivates that infection.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The pulmonary tuberculosis of petitioner occurred in the course
of his employment and was aggravated by the nature of his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a Senior Librarian in the government-owned
National Library, the biggest in the country, petitioner had to handle, sort
out, stack up volumes and volumes of books and loads of documents, old and new,
and in the daily process, he had contact with mold, mildew, and dust-polluted
air which, inhaled constantly, necessarily infected his lungs and weakened his
bodily resistance to disease more particularly to pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, petitioner's ailment is
work-connected, work-aggravated and compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the decision of respondent Workmen's
Compensation Commission is set aside and respondent National Library is hereby
ordered to pay petitioner, ANTONIO B. JUSTO, the following amounts:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Six Thousand (P6,000.00) Pesos as disability

Pesos.</blockquote>
