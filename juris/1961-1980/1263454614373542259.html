<p class="OTHERHEADING">PRESCRIPTION</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the assessment of the defi­ciency tax
was made on <st1:date year="1959" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1959</st1:date>;
but the petitio­ner claims that it never received notice of such assess­ment or
if it did, it received the notice beyond the five-year prescriptive
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To show prescription, the an­notation
on the notice (Exhibit 10 No. 52 ACR, p. 54-A of the BIR records) "No
accompanying letter 11[25]" is ad­vanced as indicative of the fact that
receipt of the no­tice was after March 24, 1959, the, last date of the
five-year period within which to assess deficiency tax, since the original
returns were filed on March 24, 1954.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the evidence is not clear on this point, We cannot
accept this interpretation of the petitioner, con­sidering the presence of
circumstances that lead Us to presume regularity in the performance of official
func­tions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of assessment
shows the assessment to have been made on <st1:date year="1959" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1959</st1:date>, well within the five-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the right side of the notice is also
stamped "<st1:date year="1959" day="26" month="2">Feb. 26, 1959</st1:date>"
- denoting the date of release, according to Bureau of Internal Revenue
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner himself in
his letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H, p. 84 of BIR records) answering
petitioner's request to lift the war­rant of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span>
and levy, asserts that notice had been sent to petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the letter of the Regional Director
forwarding the case to the Chief of the Investigation Division which the latter
received on, <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1959</st1:date>
(p. 71 of the BIR records), notice of assessment seas said to have been sent to
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the Chief of
the Investigation Division indorsed on <st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1959</st1:date> (p. 24 of the BIR records) the case to the Chief of the
Law Division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There it was alleged that
notice was alrea­dy sent to petitioner on <st1:date year="1959" day="26" month="2">February 26,1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These circumstances pointing to official performance of duty must
necessarily avail over petitioner's contrary interpre­tation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, even granting that notice had been
received by the petitioner late, as alleged, under Section 331 of the Tax Code
requiring five years within which <u>to</u> <u>assess</u> deficiency taxes, the
assessment is deemed made when notice to his effect is released, mailed or sent
by the Collector to the taxpayer and it is not required that the notice be
received by the taxpayer within the aforementioned five-year period.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

it changed the depreciable value of said assets by increasing it to conform
with the increase in cost for their replacement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, from 1950 to 1953 it deducted

</tbody></table>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon investigation and examination of
taxpayer's books and papers, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue found that the
reappraised assets depreciated in 1953 were the same ones upon which
depreciation was claimed in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
for the year 1952, the Commissioner had already de­termined, with taxpayer's
concurrence, the depreciation allowable on said assets to be P36,842.04,
computed on their acquisition cost at rates fixed by the taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Commissioner pegged the deductible
deprecia­tion for 1953 on the same old assets at P36,842.04 and disallowed the
excess thereof in the amount of P10,500.49.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question for resolution therefore is whether depreciation
shall be determined on the acquisition cost or on the reappraised value of the
assets.</p>

<p class="BODY">Depreciation is the gradual diminution in the use­ful value of
tangible property resulting from wear and tear aid normal obsolescence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term is also applied to amortization of
the value of intangible assets, the use of which in the trade or business is
definitely limi­ted in duration.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Depreciation commences with the acquisition of the property and its owner is
not bound to see his property gradually waste, without making provision out of
earnings for its replacement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
entitled to see that from earnings the value of the property invested is kept
unimpaired, so that at the end of any given terms of the years, the original
investment remains as it was in tie beginning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not only the right of a company to make such a provision, but it
is its duty to its bond and stockholder and, in the case of a public serviced
corpo­ration, at least, its plain duty to the public.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Accord­ingly, the law permits the taxpayer to recover gradually his capital
investment in wasting assets free from income tax.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Precisely, Section 30(f) (1) which states:</p>

<blockquote>(1) <u>In</u> <u>general</u>. - A reasonable allowance for
deterioration of property arising out of its use or employment in the business
or trade, or out of its not being used:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
That when the allowance authorized un­der this subsection shall equal the
capital invested by the taxpayer x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, no further allowance shall be made. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">allows a deduction from gross income for
depreciation but limits the recovery to the capital invested in the asset being
depreciated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The income tax law does not authorize the deprecia­tion of an
asset beyond its acquisition cost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, a deduction over and above such cost cannot be claimed and
allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that deductions
from gross income are privileges<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
not matters of right.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
They are not created by implication but upon clear expression in the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the recovery, free of income tax, of an amount more
than the invested capital in an asset will transgress the underlying purpose of
a depreciation al­lowance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For then what
the taxpayer would recover will be, not only the acquisition cost, but also
some profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recovery in due time thru
depreciation of investment made is the philosophy behind depreciation
allowance; the idea of profit on the investment made has never been the under­lying
reason for the allowance of a deduction for depreciation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the claim for depreciation beyond P36,842.04 or in
the amount of P10,500.49 has no justi­fication in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination, therefore, of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowing said amount, affirmed by the Court
of Tax Appeals, is sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">These were disallowed on the ground that
the nature of these expenses could not be satisfactorily explained nor could
the same be supported by appropriate papers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felix <span class="SpellE">Gulfin</span>, petitioner's accountant,
explained the P6,759.17 as actual expenses credited to the account of the
president of the corporation incurred in the interest of the corporation during
the president's trip to Manila (pp. 33-34 of TSN of Dec. 5, 1962); he stated
that the P2,300.40 was the president's <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> expenses
to and from Manila; as to the vouchers and receipts of these, he said the same
were made but got burned during the <span class="SpellE">Basi­lan</span> fire on
March 30, 1962 (p. 40 of same TSN).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner further argues that when it sent its records to Mani­la in
February, 1959 the papers in support of these mis­cellaneous and <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> expenses were not included for the reason that
by February 9, 1959, when the Bureau of Internal Revenue decided to
investigated, petitioner had no more obligation to keep the same since five
years had lapsed from the time these expenses were incurred (p. 41 of same
TSN).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this ground the petitioner may
be sus­tained for under Section 337 of the Tax Code, receipts and papers
supporting such expenses need be kept by the taxpayer for a period of five
years from the last entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time
of the investigation, said five years had lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taxpayer's stand on this issue is therefore

<blockquote>"SEC. 25. <u>Additional tax on corporation improperly
accumulating profits or surplus - (a) Imposition of tax</u>. - If any
corporation, except banks, insurance companies, or personal holding companies,
whether domestic or foreign, is formed or availed of for the purpose of
preventing, the imposition of the tax upon its shareholders or members or the
shareholders or members of another corporation, through the medium of
permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or
distributed, there is levied and assessed against such corporation, for each
taxable year, a tax equal to twenty-five <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> of the
undistributed portion of its accumulated profits or surplus which shall be in
addition to the tax imposed by section twenty-four, and shall be computed,
collected and paid in the same manner and sub­ject to the same<span style="">&nbsp; </span>provisions of law, including penalties, as
that tax."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner found that in violation of the above-quoted
section, petitioner had unreasonably accu­mulated profits as of 1953 in the
amount of P347,507.01, based on the following circumstances (Examiner's Report

no need for such increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner tried to show that in considering the surplus, the
examiner did not take into account the possible expenses for cultivation,
labor, fertilization, drainage, irrigation, repair, etc. (pp. 235-237 of TSN of
<st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">Dec. 7, 1962</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly answered by the examiner himself,
how­ever, they were already included as part of the working capital (pp.
237-238 of TSN of <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="12">Dec. 7, 1962</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the unreasonable accumulation of P347,507.01 are included
P200,000 for electrification of driers and me­chanization and P50,000 for
malaria control which were reserved way back in 1948 (p. 67 of the BIR records)
but reverted to the general fund only in 1953.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If there were any plans for these amounts to be used in further expan­sion
through projects, it did not appear in the records as was properly indicated in
1948 when such amounts were reserved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, while in 1948 it was already clear that the money was intended to
go to future projects, in 1953 upon reversion to the general fund, no such
intention was shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such reversion
therefore gave occasion for the Government to consider the same for tax
purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The P250,000 reverted to the
general fund was sought to be explained as later used elsewhere:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"part of it in the <span class="SpellE">Hilano</span>
Industries, Inc. in building the factory site and buildings to house technical
men x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> part of it was
spent in the facilities for the waterworks system and for industrialization of
the coconut industry" (p. 117 of TSN of Dec. 6, 1962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not sufficient explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Persuasive jurisprudence on the matter such
as those in the United States from where our tax law was derived,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
has it that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In order to determine
whether profits were accumulated for the reasonable needs, of the business or,
to avoid the surtax upon shareholder the controlling intention of the taxpayer
is that which is manifested at 'the time of the accumulation, not subsequently
declared intentions which are merely the products of afterthought.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The reversion here was made because the reserved amount was not enough for the
projects intended, without any in­tent to channel the same to some particular
future pro­jects in mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that since it has P560,717.44 as its expenses
for the year 1953, a surplus of P347,507.01 is not unreasonably
accumulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As rightly contended by the
Government, there is no need to have such a large amount at the beginning of
the following year because during the year, current assets are converted into
cash and with the income realized from the business as the year goes, these
expenses may well be taken care of (pp. 238 of TSN of Dec. 7, 1962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is erroneous to say that the
taxpayer is entitled to retain enough liquid net assets in amounts
approximately equal to current operating needs for the year to cover "cost
of goods sold and operating expenses" for "it excludes proper conside­ration
of funds generated by the collection of notes receivable as trade accounts
during the course of the year."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, just because the total accumulations are less than 70% of the annual
operating expenses of the year, it does not mean that the accumulations are
reasonable as a matter of law."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner tried to show that investments were made with <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> Coconut Producers Cooperative Association and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Basilan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(pp. 103-105 of TSN of <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="12">Dec. 6, 1962</st1:date>)
totaling P59,794.72 as of <st1:date year="1953" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This shows all the
more the unreasonable accumulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
of December 31, 1953 already P59,794.72 was spent - yet as of that date there
was still a surplus of P347,507.01.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner question why the examiner covered the period from
1948-1953 when the taxable year on review was 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surplus of P347,507.01 was taken by the
exami­ner from the balance sheet of petitioner for 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To check the figure arrived at, the examiner
traced the ac­cumulation process from 1947 until 1953, and petitioner's figure
stood out to be correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
error in the process applied, for previous accumulations should be considered
in determining unreasonable accumulation for the year concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In determining whether accumula­tions
of earnings or profits in a particular year are within the reasonable needs of
a corporation, it is ne­cessary to take into account prior accumulations, since
accumulations prior to the year involved may have been sufficient to cover the
business needs and additional accumulations during the year involved would not
reasonably be necessary.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another factor that stands but to show unreasonable accumulation
is the fact that large amounts were with­drawn by or advanced to the
stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the year 1953 alone
these totaled P197,229.26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet the
surplus of P347,507.01 was left as of <st1:date year="1953" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find
unacceptable petitioner's explanation that these were ad­vances made in
furtherance of the business purposes of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly held by the Court of Tax Appeals,
while certain expenses of the corporation were credited against these amounts,
the unspent balance was retained by the stockholders without refunding them to
petitioner at the end of each year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These advances were in fact indirect loans to the stockholders
indicating the unreasonable accumulation of surplus beyond the needs of the
business.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">ALLEGED EXEMPTION</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner wishes to avail of the exempting proviso in Sec. 25 of
the Internal Revenue Code as amended by R.A. 1823, approved June 22, 1957, whereby
accumulated profits or surplus if invested in any dollar-producing or
dollar-earning industry or in the purchase of bonds issued by the Central Bank,
may not be subject to the 25% tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have but to point out that the unreasonable accumulations was in 1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exemption was by virtue of Republic Act
1823 which amended Sec. 25 only June 22, 1957 - more than three years after the
pe­riod covered by the assessment.`</p>
