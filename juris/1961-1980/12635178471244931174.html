<span class="SpellE">Caspillo</span> of the crime of murder, committed, in the

<blockquote>"That on or about the 7th day of June, 1964, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, Republic of the
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction. of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, conspiring and confederating with one another, with intent

there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully, criminally and feloniously,

piece of hard wood for several times, thereby causing the instantaneous death
of said Lo­renzo <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span>,"<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Pedro Moreno and <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caspillo</span> were acquitted by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> C. Ra­mos, and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>, whose appeal is
the subject of this de<span style="">cision, was
adjudged guilty, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs
of the victim in the sum of P6, 000, to suffer the accessories provided by law,
and to pay the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Witnesses for the prosecution, seven all told, were chief of
police Fidel <span class="SpellE">Dumandan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>,
Carmen Castillo (surviving spouse of the deceased Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span>),
barrio captain <span class="SpellE">Marceliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Caspillo</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> district in <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>,
Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, mu­nicipal judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Leybag</span> of <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>, patrolman
Benjamin de Fiesta of the same municipality, and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Da</span> Jose, rural health officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The integrated testimony of Carmen Castillo, <span class="SpellE">Marceliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caspillo</span>, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and Benjamin de Fiesta points unerring­ly to the appellant <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> as the slayer of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victim Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> were neighbors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about nine o'clock on the night of
June 7, 1964 when these two had an altercation, immediately followed by <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> attacking <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span> with, a
piece of hard wood, fracturing the latter's skull, and causing his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and Benjamin de Fiesta identified <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> as the
assailant of the deceased. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> likewise declared
that he saw <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> standing over the dying victim;
de Fiesta further testified that he saw him run away from the scene of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De Fiesta even gave chase but was
unable to apprehend him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supporting the
declarations of these two witnesses was the admission to <span class="SpellE">Marceliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caspillo</span> made by the appellant's wife (Clarita
Castillo) in the presence of de Fiesta and <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
that her husband succeeded in killing <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span> <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of her attempt to stop him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Municipal judge <span class="SpellE">Leybag</span> testified that
he notarized exhibit A, which in essence is a sworn confession accomplished by <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>, and which substantially recites that it was he who
killed the deceased by hitting him on the head with a piece of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Leybag</span>
further declared that he inquired from the appellant whether the confession was
voluntary and whether the statements contained there­in were correct and true,
and that <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also <span class="SpellE">undenied</span> that in the morning
of the next day, <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> and his wife disappeared
from <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>, which fact left its indelible
impression on the judge <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, prompting him to remark (in his
decision) in connection therewith that "Not only did he run away from the
scene of the incident but he disappeared entirely from <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>
that evening as well as in the following days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>
did was to fly away from the scene of the incident and from <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to look for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is strange,
however, why even his wife had to leave early that very morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the purpose only of <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>
in going to Manila was to look for work, considering, however, that <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>, is related to
the deceased Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span>, and it is the custom in
the rural communities for anyone to attend to the burial of his relatives, the
Court cannot reconcile itself to the explanation of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> that instead of attending the burial of a
relative he would leave so early in the morning for Manila to look for
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, if this is so, his wife
should have remained but even his wife disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> left <span class="SpellE">Talugtog</span> that
evening and could not be seen anymore, the only logical conclusion that could
be established is that he really fled away from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This flight indicates the consciousness of
guilt on the part of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>.
"</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our considered view that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
correctly accorded credence to the version of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cumulative testimony of the prosecution
witnesses does not suffer from any infirmity; no bias of any form, shape or
substance is imputed to any of the State witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only the appellant testified for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a perceptive and careful examination of
his declarations, it is sufficient for as to state, in appraisal of his
testimony, that (1) his denial of the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of the execution of exhibit <span style="">A </span>cannot
stand in the face of the positive testimony of Judge <span class="SpellE">Leybag</span>
to the contrary, and (2) that the material contradictions between the
appellant's testimony in court and the contents of exhibit A render doubtful -
so the court noted, arid with which we agree - the veracity of his testimony in
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> found <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>
guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the information explicitly alleges
that the crime was committed with evident premeditation and by means of
treachery, the court in its decision was strangely silent about these two
aggravating or qualifying circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in its decision does the court demonstrate the attendance of
these circumstances, and the record itself is barren of evidence in respect to
the presence of any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
therefore not prepared to say that the offense was committed with any
aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, the evidence for the prosecution would seem to indicate that the
appellant and the deceased were facing each other when the fatal blow was
struck.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the proven factual milieu, the offense imputable to the
appellant is only simple homicide. </p>

<p class="BODY">Homicide is penalized with <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> by
article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the proper penalty that may be
imposed on the appellant is <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
to <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here where
neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances are attendant, the
indeterminate penalty to be imposed should be in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our view, the ap­pellant should be
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from nine (9) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> to sixteen (16) years of <u>reclusion
temporal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity to be paid
to the heirs of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span> should be increased to
P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>,
L-18793, Oct. 11, 1968, 25 SCRA 468).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is modified
in the sense that the appellant is adjudged guilty only of the crime of
homicide, and is hereby sentenced to suffer indeterminate imprisonment of from
nine (9) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> to
sixteen (16) years of <u>reclu­sion</u> <u>temporal</u>, to indemnify the heirs
of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Grospe</span> in the sum of P12, 000, to suffer
the accessories provided by <span style="">law, </span>and
to pay the costs.</p>
