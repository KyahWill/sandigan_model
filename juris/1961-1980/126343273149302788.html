Republic of the Philippines (Bureau of Agricultural Extension),
Respondent" reversing the decision of the Chief, Workmen's Compensation
Unit, Regional Office No. 2, and absolving the respondent from any liability
under the Workmen's Compensation Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March, 3, 1975, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Micu</span>, petitioner, filed a Notice of Injury and Claim for
Compensation seeking to recover disability compensation and reimbursement of
medical expenses arising from a sickness which allegedly supervened during her
employment with the respondent, Bureau of Agricultural Extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said respondent filed its Employer's
Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date of the hearing only
the claimant and her counsel appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent, although duly notified, did not appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claimant was allowed to adduce her
evidence <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence established that <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Micu</span> was employed as technician with the Bureau of
Agricultural Extension in 1954; that later her salary was P4,771.20 per annum;
that during her employment with said respondent, she contracted illness
diagnosed as "<span class="SpellE">Myoma</span>, Uteri" which was
aggravated by reason of the nature of her employment because she had to go on
field work at her station even during inclement weather and during her
menstrual period she had profuse bleeding; that by reason of such ailment, she
submitted to medical examination and was found that she had to undergo operation;
that the claimant was operated twice, on October 16 and on October 18, 1974;
that she spent the sum of P3,000.00 for hospitalization and medication but only
the sum of P2,893.74 was recommended by the Medical Rating Officer; that the
claimant worked on and off on account of her sickness; that she went on sick
leave of absence from July 22, 1974 to May 11, 1975; and that the claimant
filed an application for optional retirement effective at the close of office
hours on May 30, 1975.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence of record, the Chief, Workmen's
Compensation Unit of Region Office No. 2 declared the claimant to be entitled
to benefits on the following considerations:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering, the probative value of the evidence adduced
during the hearing of this case, we find, that the claimant is entitled to the
benefits of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. Under Section 13 of the Act, the claimant is entitled to the
reim­bursement of her medical, surgical and hospital expenses, as the nature of
her sickness so require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case,
claimant alleged to have spent the sum of more than THREE THOUSAND (P3,000.00)
PESOS, but only the sum of P2,893.74 was duly recommended by the Medical Rating
Officer to be reimbursed to the herein claimant after careful scrutiny of these
medical receipts and therefore the claimant is only entitled to the amount
recommended by the doctor to be reimbursed in the sum of TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
HUNDRED NINETY THREE (P2,893.74) PESOS &amp; 74/100 Centavos.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Under Section 14 of the Act, the claimant is entitled to
compensation for disability for labor for the periods that she was
incapacitated for labor equivalent to sixty (60%) per centum of the average
weekly wage of the claim­ant for 42 weeks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sixty (60%) per centum of the average weekly wage of the claimant which
was P91.75 (P4,771.20 ÷ 52 = P91.75 x 60% - P55.05 x 42 - P2,312.10) equals
P55.05 and for 42 weeks, the claimant is entitled to a sum of TWO THOUSAND
THREE HUNDRED TWELVE (P2,312.10) PESOS &amp; 10 Centavos.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>NOW THEREFORE, under Sections 13 and 14 of the Act, the claimant is
entitled to a total sum of FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIVE (P5,205.84) PESOS
&amp; 84/100 Centavos, representing reimbursement of her medical, surgical and
hospital expenses and compensation for disability for labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The check or money order covering payment of
compensation benefits should be drawn in favor of the claimant and remitted to
this Office for record purposes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>DECISION, therefore, is hereby entered in favor of the claimant and
against the respondent and the respondent is directed to pay the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) To the claimant, THRU THIS OFFICE, the sum of FIVE THOUSAND TWO
HUNDRED FIVE (P5,205.84) PESOS &amp; 84/100 Centavos, representing reimbursement
of her medical, surgical and hospital expenses and compensation for her
disability for labor, pursuant to Sections 14 and 13 of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) TO THIS OFFICE, the sum of FIFTY TWO (P52.00) PESOS, representing
FEE, pursuant to Section 55 of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) To Atty. JUSTO MICU of <st1:city><st1:place>San Mateo</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, the sum of P260.29 representing Attorney's
Fees, pursuant to Section 31 of the Act."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, Republic of the Philippines (Bureau of
Agricultural Extension), admits that the decision rendered by the Chief of the
Workmen's Compensation Unit of Regional Office No. 2 was received by its
counsel on August 4, 1975 and that the petition to elevate the re­cords for
relief from judgment was filed on September 30, 1975, after the lapse of the
period for filing the motion for reconsideration but justifies the delay on the
ground of pressure and volume of work of the respondent's coun­sel.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
We have held in several cases that volume and pressure of work is not a valid
excuse for not filing an appeal or petition for relief on time.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Granting, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that there
was justification for the late filing of the petition to elevate the records
for relief from judgment, this Court finds that the petition for review is
meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission absolved the respondent,
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Agricultural Extension), from liability on the ground that the
petitioner's sickness, <span class="SpellE">Myoma</span> Uteri, is tumor of the
uterus which is neither caused nor aggravated by her employment.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact, however, that the petitioner contracted her illness
during her employment with the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Agricultural Extension) and that said illness was aggravated by her
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even during inclement
weather she had to perform field work and during her menstrual period she had
profuse bleeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the illness
supervened during her employment with the respondent, Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Agricultural Extension).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, it is presumed that the claim is compensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Simon</span>, versus Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Supreme Court)<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
a very recent case penned by Mr. Justice Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
this Court held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> assuming the employee's illness may be ruled out as an
occupational disease or that the causal link between the nature of his
employment and his ailment has been insufficiently shown, nevertheless, it is
to be presumed as mandated by Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act,
that the employee's illness which supervened during his employment either arose
out of or at least aggravated by said employment and with this presumption, the
burden of proofs shifts to the employer and the employee is relieved of the
burden to show causation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
before Us, the respondent has failed to discharge that burden x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Agricultural Extension), did not adduce any evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption that the claim is compensable
was not rebutted.</p>

<p class="BODY">WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside and the
respondent, Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Agricultural Extension), is ordered:</p>

<blockquote>1) To pay the claimant the sum of Two Thousand Three Hundred Twelve
Pesos and Ten Centavos (P2,312.10) as compensation benefit;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) To pay the claimant the sum of Two Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety-Three
Pesos and Seventy-Four Centavos (P2,893.74) as reimbursement for medical
expenses if supported by proper receipts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) To pay the claimant attorney's fees in the amount of Five
Hundred Twenty Pesos (P520.00); and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4) To pay the successor of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
the sum of Sixty-One Pesos (P61.00) as administrative fee.</blockquote>
