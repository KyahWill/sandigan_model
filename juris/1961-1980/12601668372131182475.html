				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals imposing a 
tax deficiency liability of P1,317,629.61 on Liddell &amp; Co., Inc.
<p>Said company lists down several issues which may be boiled to the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>a</em>) Whether or not Judge Umali of the Tax Court below could validly 
participate in the making of the decision;</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) Whether or not Liddell &amp; Co. Inc., and the Liddell Motors 
Inc. are (practically) identical corporations, the latter being merely the 
<em>alter ego</em> of the former;</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) Whether or not, granting the identical nature of the 
corporations, the assessment of tax liability, including the surcharge thereon, 
by the Court of Tax Appeals, is correct.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Undisputed Facts</em>.—The parties submitted a partial stipulation of 
facts, each reserving the right to present additional evidence.</p>
<p>Said undisputed facts are substantially as follows:</p>
<p>The petitioner, Liddell &amp; Co. Inc., (Liddell &amp; Co. for short) is a 
domestic corporation established in the Philippines on February 1, 1946, with an 
authorized capital of P100,000 divided into 1000 shares at P100 each. Of this 
authorized capital, 196 shares valued at P19,600 were subscribed and paid by 
Frank Liddell while the other four shares were in the name of Charles Kurz, E. 
J. Darras, Angel Manzano and Julian Serrano at one share each. Its purpose was 
to engage in the business of importing and retailing Oldsmobile and Chevrolet 
passenger cars and GMC and Chevrolet trucks.</p>
<p>On January 31, 1947, with the limited paid-in capital of P20,000, Liddell 
&amp; Co. was able to declare a 900% stock dividend after which declaration, 
Frank Liddell's holdings in the company increased to 1,960 shares and the 
employees, Charles Kurz, E.J. Darras, Angel Manzano and Julian Serrano at 10 
shares each. The declaration of stock dividend was followed by a resolution 
increasing the authorized capital of the company to P1,000,000 which the 
Securities &amp; Exchange Commission approved on March 3, 1947. Upon such 
approval, Frank Liddell subscribed to 3,000 additional shares, for which he paid 
into the corporation P300,000 so that he had in his own name 4,960 shares.</p>
<p>On May 24, 1947, Frank Liddell, on one hand and Messrs.Kurz, Darras, Manzano 
and Serrano on the other, executed an agreement (Exhibit A) which was further 
supplemented by two other agreements (Exhibits B and C) dated May 24, 1947 and 
June 3, 1948, wherein Frank Liddell transferred (On June 7, 1948) to various 
employees of Liddell &amp; Co. shares of stock.</p>
<p>At the annual meeting of stockholders of Liddell &amp; Co. held on March 9, 
1948, a 100% stock dividend was declared, thereby increasing the <em>issued 
capital stock</em> of said corporation to P1,000,000. The stockholders also 
approved a resolution increasing the <em>authorized capital stock</em> from 
P1,000,000 to P3,000,000 which increase was duly approved by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission on June 7, 1948. Frank Liddell subscribed to and paid 20% of 
the increase of P400,000. He paid 25% thereof in the amount of P100,000 and the 
balance of P300,000 was merely debited to Frank Liddell-Drawing Account and 
credited to Subscribed Capital Stock on December 31, 1948.</p>
<p>On March 8, 1949 , stock dividends were again issued by Liddell &amp; Co. and 
in accordance with the agreements, Exhibits A, B, and C, the stocks of said 
company stood as follows:</p>

<p>On the basis of the agreement Exhibit A, (May, 1947) 55% of the earnings 
available for dividends accrued to Frank Liddell although at the time of the 
execution of said instrument, Frank Liddell owned all of the shares in said 
corporation. 45% accrued to the employees, parties thereto: Kurz 12½%; Darras 
12½%; A. Manzano 12½% and Julian Serrano 7½%. The agreement Exhibit A was also 
made retroactive to 1946. Frank Liddell reserved the right to reapportion the 
45% dividends pertaining to the employees <em>in the future</em> for the purpose 
of including such other faithful and efficient employees as he may subsequently 
designate. (As a matter of fact, Frank Liddell did so designate, two additional 
employees namely: E. Hasim and G. W. Kernot). It was for such inclusion of 
future faithful employees that Exhibits B-1 and C were executed. As per Exhibit 
C, dated May 13, 1948, the 45% given by Frank Liddell to his employees was 
reapportioned as follows: C. Kurz—12%; E. J. Darras—12%; A. Manzano—12%; J. 
Serrano 3½%; G. W. Kernot—2%.</p>
<p>Exhibit B contains the employees' definition in detail of the manner by which 
they sought to prevent their shareholdings from being transferred to others who 
may be complete strangers to the business of Liddell &amp; Co.</p>
<p>From 1946 until November 22, 1948 when the purpose clause of the Articles of 
Incorporation of Liddell &amp; Co. Inc., was amended so as to limit its business 
activities to importations of automobiles and trucks, Liddle &amp; Co. was 
engaged in business as an importer and at the same time retailer of Oldsmobile 
and Chevrolet passenger cars and GMC and Chevrolet trucks.</p>
<p>On December 20, 1948, the Liddle Motors, Inc. was organized and registered 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission with an authorized capital stock of 
P100,000 of which P20,000 was subscribed and paid for as follows: Irene Liddle, 
wife of Frank Liddell, 19,996 shares and Messrs, Marcial P. Lichauco, E. K. 
Branwell, V. E. del Rosario and Esmenia Silva, 1 share each.</p>
<p>At about the end of the year 1948, Messrs. Manzano, Kurz and Kernot resigned 
from their respective positions in the Retail Dept. of Liddell &amp; Co. and 
they were taken in and employed by Liddell Motors, Inc., Kurz as 
Manager-Treasurer, Manzano as General Sales Manager for cars and Kernot as 
General Sales Manager for trucks.</p>
<p>Beginning January, 1949, Liddell &amp; Co. stopped retailing cars and trucks; 
it conveyed them instead to Liddell Motors, Inc. which in turn sold the vehicles 
to the public with a steep mark-up. Since then, Liddell &amp; Co. paid sales 
taxes on the basis of its sales to Liddell Motors, Inc. considering said sales 
as its original sales.</p>
<p>Upon review of the transactions between Liddell &amp; Co. and Liddell Motors 
Inc., the Collector of Internal Revenue determined that the latter was but an 
<em>alter ego</em> of Liddell &amp; Co. Wherefore, he concluded, that for sales 
tax purposes, those sales made by Liddell Motors, Inc. to the public were 
considered as the original sales of Liddell &amp; Co. Accordingly, the Collector 
of Internal Revenue assessed against Liddell &amp; Co. a sales tax deficiency, 
including surcharges, in the amount of P1,317,629.61. In the computation, the 
gross selling price of Liddell Motors, Inc. to the general public from January 
1, 1949 to September 15, 1950. was made the basis without deducting from the 
selling price, the taxes already paid by Liddell &amp; Co. in its sales to the 
Liddell Motors, Inc.</p>
<p>The Court of Tax Appeals upheld the position taken by the Collector of 
Internal Revenue.</p>
<ol type="A"><li><em>Judge Umali</em>—Appellant urges the disqualification of Judge Roman M. 
Umali to participate in the decision of the instant case because he was Chief of 
the Law Division, then Acting Deputy Collector and later Chief Counsel of the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue during the time when the assessment in question was 
made.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> In refusing to disqualify himself 
despite admission that he had held the, aforementioned offices, Judge Umali 
stated that he had not in any way participated, nor expressed any definite 
opinion, on any question raised by the parties when this case was presented for 
resolution before the said bureau. Furthermore, after careful inspection of the 
records of the Bureau, he (Judge Umali as well as the other members of the Court 
below), had not found any indication that he had expressed any opinion or made 
any decision that would tend to disqualify him from participating in the 
consideration of the case in the Tax Court. 
<p>At this juncture, it is well to consider that petitioner did not question the 
truth of Judge Umali's statements. In view thereof, this Tribunal is not 
inclined to disqualify said judge. Moreover, in furtherance of the presumption 
of a judge's moral sense of responsibility this Court has adopted, and now here 
repeats, the ruling that the mere participation of a judge in prior proceedings 
relating to the subject in the capacity of an administrative official does not 
necessarily disqualify him from acting as judge.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>Appellant also contends that Judge Umali signed the said decision contrary to 
the provision of Section 13, Republic Act No. 1125,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span> that whereas the case was submitted for 
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals on July 12, 1955, and the decision of 
Associate Judge Luciano and Judge Nable were both signed on August 11, 1955 
(that is, on the last day of the 30-day period provided for in Section 13, 
Republic Act No. 1125). Judge Umali signed the decision August 31, 1955 or 20 
days after the lapse of the 30-day period alloted by law.</p>
<p>By analogy it may be said that inasmuch as in Republic Act No. 1125 (law 
creating the Court of Tax Appeals) like the law governing the procedure in the 
Court of Industrial Relations, there is no provision invalidating decisions 
rendered after the lapse of 30 days, the requirement of Section 13, Republic Act 
No. 1125 should be construed as directory.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span></p>
<p>Besides as pointed out by appellee, the third paragraph of Section 13 of 
Republic Act No. 1125 (quoted in the margin)<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> confirms this view, because in providing for 
two thirty-day periods, the law means that decisions may still be rendered 
within the second period of thirty days (Judge Umali signed his decision within 
that period).</p>

</li><li><em>Identity of the two corporations</em>.—On the question whether or not 
Liddell Motors, Inc. is the <em>alter ego</em> of Liddell &amp; Co. Inc., we are 
fully convinced that Liddell &amp; Co. is wholly owned by Frank Liddell. As one 
of the time of its organization, 98% of the capital stock belonged to Frank 
Liddell. The 20% paid-up subscription with which the company began its business 
was paid by him. The subsequent subscriptions to the capital stock were made by 
him and paid with his own money.

<p>These stipulations and conditions appear in Exhibit A: (1) that Frank Liddell 
had the authority to designate in the future the employee who could receive 
earnings of the corporation; to apportion among the stockholders the share in 
the profits; (2) that all certificates of stock in the names of the employees 
should be deposited with Frank Liddell duly endorsed in blank by the employees 
concerned; (3) that each employee was required to sign an agreement with the 
corporation to the effect that, upon his death or upon his retirement or 
separation for any cause whatsoever from the corporation, the said corporation 
should, within a period of sixty days therefor, have the absolute and exclusive 
option to purchase and acquire the whole of the stock interest of the employees 
so dying, resigning, retiring or separating.</p>
<p>These stipulations in our opinion attest to the fact that Frank Liddell owned 
Liddell &amp; Co. Inc. They guarantee his complete control over the 
corporation.</p>
<p>As to Liddell Motors Inc. we are fully persuaded that Frank Liddell also 
owned it. He supplied the original capital funds.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> It is not proven that his wife Irene, 
ostensibly the sole incorporator of Liddell Motors Inc. had money of her own to 
pay for her P20,000 initial subscription.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[7]</sup></span> Her income in the United States in the year 
1943 and 1944 and the savings therefrom could not be enough to cover the amount 
of subscription, much less to operate an expensive trade like the retail of 
motor vehicles. The alleged sale of her property in Oregon might have been true, 
but the money received therefrom was never shown to have been saved or deposited 
so as to be still available at the time of the organization of the Liddell 
Motors, Inc.</p>
<p>The evidence at hand also shows that Irene Liddell had scant participation in 
the affairs of Liddell Motors, Inc. She could hardly be said to possess business 
experience. The income tax forms record no independent income of her own. As a 
matter of fact, the checks that represented her salary and bonus from Liddell 
Motors, Inc. found their way into the personal account of Frank Liddell. Her 
frequent absences from the country negate any active participation in the 
affairs of the Motors company.</p>
<p>There are quite a series of conspicuous circumstances that militate against 
the separate and distinct personality of Liddell Motors, Inc. from Liddell &amp; 
Co.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[8]</sup></span> We notice that the bulk of the 
business of Liddell &amp; Co. was channelled through Liddell Motors, Inc. On the 
other hand, Liddell Motors, Inc. pursued no activities except to secure cars, 
trucks, and spare parts from Liddell &amp; Co. Inc. and then sell them to the 
general public. These sales of vehicles by Liddell &amp; Co. to Liddell Motors, 
Inc. for the most part were shown to have taken place on the same day that 
Liddell Motors, Inc. sold such vehicles to the public. We may even say that the 
cars and trucks merely touched the hands of Liddell Motors, Inc. as a matter of 
formality.</p>
<p>During the first six months of 1949, Liddell &amp; Co. issued ten (10) checks 
payable to Frank Liddell which were deposited by Frank Liddell in his personal 
account with the Philippine National Bank. During this time also, he issued in 
favor of Liddell Motors, Inc. six (6) checks drawn against his personal account 
with the same bank. The checks issued by Frank Liddell to the Liddell Motors, 
Inc. were significantly for the most part issued on the same day when Liddel 
&amp; Co., Inc. issued the checks for Frank Liddell<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[9]</sup></span> and for the same amounts.</p>
<p>It is of course accepted that the mere fact that one or more corporations are 
owned and controlled by a single stockholder is not of itself sufficient ground 
for disregarding separate corporate entities. Authorities<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[10]</sup></span> support the rule that it is lawful to obtain 
a corporation charter, even with a single substantial stockholder, to engage in 
a specific activity, and such activity may co-exist with other private 
activities of the stockholder. If the corporation is a substantial one, 
conducted lawfully and without fraud on another, its separate identity is to be 
respected.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the mere fact that Liddell &amp; Co. and Liddell Motors, Inc. 
are corporations owned and controlled by Frank Liddell directly or indirectly is 
not by itself sufficient to justify the disregard of the separate corporate 
identity of one from the other. There is however, in this instant case, a 
peculiar consequence of the organization and activities of Liddell Motors, 
Inc.</p>
<p>Under the law in force at the time of its incorporation the sales tax on 
original sales of cars (sections 184, 185 and 186 of the National Internal 
Revenue Code), was progressive, i.e. 10% of the selling price of the car if it 
did not exceed P5,000, and 15% of the price if more than P5,000 but not more 
than P7,000, etc. This progressive rate of the sales tax naturally would tempt 
the taxpayer to employ a way of reducing the price of the first sale. And 
Liddell Motors, Inc. was the medium created by Liddell &amp; Co. to reduce the 
price and the tax liability.</p>
<p>Let us illustrate: a car with engine motor No. 212381 was sold by Liddel 
&amp; Co., Inc. to Liddel Motors, Inc. on January 17, 1949 for P4,546,000.55 
including tax; the price of the car was P4,133,000.23, the tax paid being 
P413.22, at 10%. And when this car was later sold (on the same day!) by Liddell 
Motors, Inc. to P.V. Luistro for P5,500, no more sales tax was paid.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[11]</sup></span> In this price of P5,500 was included the 
P413.32 representing taxes paid by Liddell &amp; Co. Inc. in the sale to Liddell 
Motors, Inc. Deducting P413.32 representing taxes paid by Liddell &amp; Co., 
Inc. from the price of P5,500, the balance of P5,087.68 would have been the net 
selling price of Liddell &amp; Co., Inc. to the general public (had Liddell 
Motors, Inc. not participated and intervened in the sale), and 15% sales tax 
would have been due. In this transaction, P349.68 in the form of taxes was 
evaded. All the other transactions (numerous) examined in this light will 
inevitably reveal that the Government coffers had been deprived of a sizable 
amount of taxes.</p>
<p>As opined in the case of Gregory <em>vs</em>. Kelvering,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[12]</sup></span> "the legal right of a taxpayer to decrease 
the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by 
means which the law permits, cannot be doubted." But, as held in another 
case,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[13]</sup></span> "where a corporation is a dummy, 
is unreal or a sham and serves no business purpose and is intended only as a 
blind, the corporate form may be ignored for the law cannot countenance a form 
that is bald and mischievous fiction."</p>
<p>Consistently with this view, the United States Supreme Court<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[14]</sup></span> held that "a taxpayer may gain advantage of 
doing business thru a corporation if he pleases, but the revenue officers in 
proper cases, may disregard the separate corporate entity where it serves but as 
a shield for tax evasion and treat the person who actually may take the benefits 
of the transactions as the person accordingly taxable."</p>
<p>Thus we repeat: to allow a taxpayer to deny tax liability on the ground that 
the sales were made through another and distinct corporation when it is proved 
that the latter is virtually owned by the former or that they are practically 
one and the same is to sanction a circumvention of our tax laws.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[15]</sup></span></p>

</li><li><em>Tax liability computation</em>:—In the Yutivo case:<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[16]</sup></span> the same question involving the computation 
of the alleged deficiency sales tax has been raised. In accordance with our 
ruling in said case we hold as correctly stated by Judge Nable in his concurring 
and dissenting opinion on this case, that the deficiency sales tax should be 
based on the selling price obtained by Liddell Motors, Inc. to the public 
<em>after deducting the tax already paid by the Liddell &amp; Co. Inc.</em> in 
its sales to Liddell Motors, Inc.

<p>On the imposition of the 50% surcharge by reason of fraud, we see that the 
transactions between Liddell Motors, Inc. and Liddell &amp; Co. have always been 
embodied in proper documents, constantly subject to inspection by the tax 
authorities. Liddell &amp; Co. have always made a full report of its income and 
receipts in its income tax returns.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing our decision in the Yutivo case, we may now say, in filing its 
return on the basis of its sales to Liddell Motors, Inc. and not on those by the 
latter to the public, it cannot be held that the Liddell &amp; Co. deliberately 
made a false return for the purpose of defrauding the government of its 
revenues, and should suffer a 50% surcharge. But penalty for late payment (25%) 
should be imposed.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby modified: 
Liddell &amp; Co. Inc. is declared liable only for the amount of P426,811.67 
with 25% surcharge for late payment and 6% interest thereon from the time the 
judgment becomes final.</p>
<p>As it appears, that, during the pendency of this litigation, appellant paid 
under protest to the Government the total amount assessed by the Collector, the 
latter is hereby required to return the excess to the petitioner.</p>
<p>No costs.</p></li></ol>
