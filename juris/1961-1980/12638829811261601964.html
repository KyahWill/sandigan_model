				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court denies with finality for lack of merit the Motion for
Reconsideration of the Court's Decision of <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1977</st1:date> as filed by the Solicitor General on behalf
of respondent Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Republic vs. Workmen's Compensation Com­mission, 30
SCRA 811, cited by respondent has no application in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "judicial interpretation"
therein that "the power to hear and decide claims for compensation under
the Workmen's Compensation Act is, pursuant to Section 46 thereof, under the
'exclusive jurisdiction' of the WCC, subject to appeal to the Supreme
Court", while recognizing that Amendatory Republic Act 4119 approved on
June 20, 1964 provides that referees "shall assume original jurisdiction
over all workmen's compensation cases in the regional offices where they are
assigned", and that the com­mission's jurisdiction is therefore not
"exclusively appellate" in character but that it may
"receive" evidence and "additional testi­mony",<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
has not been abandoned or set aside in the decisions at bar (assuming that the
same may be deemed not to have been superseded by the procedures provided in
Department Order No. 3, Series of 1974 of the Secretary of Labor issued
pursuant to LOI No. 190 dated June 3, 1974).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is therefore no basis for respondents' invoking the
Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and strawman-argument that the "judicial interpretation" made in <u>Republic
vs. Workmen's Compensation Com­mission</u>, <u>supra</u>, can only be
overturned or modified by this Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">What respondent has lost sight of is that under the law and
settled jurisprudence, the fundamental and indisputable jurisdictional rule, as
set forth in countless decisions of this Court <u>en banc</u>, is that
"decisions in workmen's compensation cases, become, by ex­press statutory
prescription, final and executory after fifteen (15) days from notice thereof,
'unless previously appealed,' or a petition for review has been filed within
the same period."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore a <u>sine qua non</u> requisite that for the
commission to validly exercise its "exclusive jurisdiction" or
"primary duty of determining the merits of a claim"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and reverse the re­feree's decision granting an "undue award", it
must have acquired jurisdiction over the referee's decision-award by the
perfection of an appeal to it within the 15-day statutory and mandatory
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure on respondent's part to
take such an appeal, within the statutory <span style="">period
</span>rendered the referee's award final and executory and deprived the
commission, by mandate of the law, of jurisdiction to alter or reverse the
referee's award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Execution of such final
award thereupon became a ministerial function.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's contention that the commission could
"suspend" or disregard the reglementary 30-day period from notice of
award within which a last-chance petition for relief from the final and
executory award may be filed is tenuous and untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has consistently held that such a
grace period "is absolutely fixed, in-extendible, never interrupted, and
cannot be subjected to any condi­tion or contingency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the period fixed is itself devised to
meet a condition or contingency, the equitable remedy is an act of grace, as it
were, designed to give the aggrieved party another and last chance" and
failure to avail of such last chance within the ultimate grace period is fatal.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the equitable remedy of re­lief from judgment is available only in
exceptional cases and the facts showing mistake or excusable negligence (for
not timely taking an appeal from judgment, notice and copy of which had been
duly served the petitioner) must be <u>clearly</u> and <u>convincingly</u>
shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the petitioner has failed
to "take the necessary and appropriate precautions required by the
circumstances, which resulted in (its) being unable to take an appeal from the
said award of the referee" the petition for relief, even if filed within
the grace period, will fail since it must be convincingly shown that
"fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence" prevented the
appeal from being timely taken.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5-a</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated by the Court in <u>Luzsteveco</u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the doctrine of finality of judgments "is embodied in section 51 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act and Rule 19 of the commission's Rules which ordain
that as soon as the decision has become final and executory, the Chief of the
Unit or duly deputized official of the regional office shall <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u>
or on motion of the claimant issue a writ of execution for enforcement of the
award granted in the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doctrine is based upon a fundamental public policy that litigants should know
exactly when they may obtain execution and consider the case terminated and
hence, a strict observance of the reglementary period within which to exercise
the statutory right of appeal has been con­sidered as absolutely indispensable
to the prevention of needless de­lays and to the orderly and speedy discharge
of judicial business."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
More so is such doctrine to be faithfully adhered to in workmen's compensation
cases in view of the spirit of the Workmen's Compen­sation Act "to promote
the expeditious disposal of workmen's com­pensation cases" to accomplish
its objective of giving death and dis­ability compensation and benefits to the
needy workers and their families who are entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, respondent's Motion for Reconsideration is
denied.</p>

These pronouncements were made by this Court to sustain the commission's
favorable action directly on the claimant's motion for reimbursement of <u>ad­ditional</u>
medical expenses <u>without</u> passing through the regional office - although
the basic ground for sustaining the commission's order granting such additional
reimbursement was that it "partook merely of the nature of a petition for
the <u>implementation</u>" of an earlier and final decision which granted
dis­ability compensation, reimbursement and medical assistance until the
illness was cured or arrested.</p>
