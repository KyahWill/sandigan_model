				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Republic of the Philippines, by authority of Republic Act No. 1400, represented by the Land Tenure Administration, filed on December 2, 1957, in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan a complaint against the defendants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for the expropriation of the lands of the "Hacienda El Porvenir", having an area of 1,352.84245 hectares, situated in the municipalities of Tayug, Natividad, San Quintin and Sta. Maria, province of Pangasinan.&nbsp; In the complaint it was alleged, among other things, that the aggregate assessed value of the property was P434,440.00, and that the continuous agrarian conflicts between defendants and their tenants could be solved only through the purchase of said property by the government.&nbsp; Defendants, in their amended motion to dismiss, sought the dismissal of the complaint, alleging that the hacienda was no longer a co-ownership but had been partitioned among the several heirs of Crisanto Lichauco, and that Republic Act No. 1400 was unconstitutional. <p></p>On March 23, 1961, the plaintiff and the defendants filed in court an "Agreement and Joint Motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> as follows: <blockquote><p> "COMES NOW the plaintiff, represented by the Land Tenure Administration, and the defendants Mariano F.

Case No. 1 should be decided adversely against them; otherwise all such amounts deposited with Amanda L. de la Cruz shall be paid or delivered by her to the said defendants, Macario, Mariano, Jose Manuel Lichauco and Francisco and Jose Castillo immediately after the termination of such case; provided, however, that no payment or delivery of the said amounts shall be made, until and unless said G.L.R.O. Case No. 1 and its related cases shall have been terminated; and provided further that should the liability of each of the defendant co-owners exceed the value of said ten hectares, all of them shall be liable for their proportionate share of said excess, but in no case shall the liability of Amanda de la Cruz, Renato P.

In considering as a guide in endeavoring to fix the reasonable and fair market value of the lands now under expropriation the case of "Municipality of Bustos <em>vs</em>. Natividad Santos, et al., CA-G.R. No. 22547-R; the case of "Commonwealth of the Philippines <em>vs</em>. Pedro de Guzman," Civil Case No. 8425 of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Lingayen Branch, and CA-G.R. No. 20358-R; and the case of "Republic of the Philippines <em>vs</em>. Irene R. Ombac," Civil Case No. 13555 of the same Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, without basis in fact and in law and contrary to existing jurisprudence. </p>2. In concurring with the findings of the majority report of the Commissioners of Appraisal as to the classifications of the lots involved in this expropriation which is not sustained by the evidence on record and which is contrary to law. &nbsp; <p> 3. In finding and fixing the reasonable and fair market value of the lands under expropriation as — P5,500.00 per hectare of 1st class irrigated ricelands; P4,500.00 per hectare of 2nd class irrigated ricelands; P4,000.00 per hectare of 3rd class irrigated ricelands; P4,500.00 per hectare of 1st class sugarcane land; P3,000.00 per hectare of 4th class sugarcane land; P4,000.00 per hectare of 1st class upland; P3,500.00 per hectare of 2nd class upland; P1,500.00 per hectare of rolling lands and P1.00 per square meter of residential land thus giving a total just compensation to the landowners for the 990 hectares, 17 ares and 25 centares of land expropriated the amount of P4,957,601.86 and not P1,980,345.00 which is the fair market value of the property expropriated and should be its "just compensation." </p>4. In not finding that the valuation made by the defendant landowners of their property as demanded by them in their "Motion to Dismiss" (Answer) is an admission and evidence of the highest order so much so that their demand of P4,000.00 per hectare in their answer, should set the ceiling price for the just compensation to be awarded them. &nbsp; <p> 5. In considering the property under expropriation as subdivided among the heirs and thus made a lot by lot classification and valuation of the property without considering the said property as one whole mass owned by several co-owners, without basis in law and in contravention of accepted principles of valuation. </p>6. In not providing in the decision, as stipulated by the parties in the "Agreement and Joint Motion" that in case an increase in area in G.L.R.O. No. 1 is adjusted and/or adjudicated in favor of the defendant co-owners, "the plaintiff shall have the option to buy the said portions in question as adjudicated and to pay the corresponding price as in this expropriation case." &nbsp; <p> 7. In not deducting from the total valuation of the property the value for two parcels of land, namely; one hectare for the school site at barrio Saleng and 1.8 hectare for the school site at barrio C. Lichauco, which were previously donated by the landowners to the municipal government of Tayug, Pangasinan. </p>8. In finding and holding that the plaintiff does not have the right and option to choose where the retained areas should be taken from the whole property, contrary to established jurisprudence. &nbsp; <p> 9. In not providing that the amount of P500,000.00 additional provisional value should be deducted from the total balance due the defendants, and should not earn legal interest from the date of plaintiffs possession of the property, in accordance with the motion of the parties and the order of the trial court dated January 3, 1962. </p>10. In not providing in the decision that payment be made to creditor banks, as stipulated by the parties in the "Agreement and Joint Motion," in order that all liens and encumbrances be cancelled, so that title to the property be transferred to the government free and clear thereof. </blockquote><p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the first error assigned, plaintiff-contends that the trial court erred in considering as a guide in fixing the fair market value of the lands under expropriation the case of Municipality of Bustos <em>vs</em>. Natividad Santos, et al., CA-G.R. No. 22547-R; Civil Case No. 8425 of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, and CA-G.R. No. 20358-R; and Republic of the Philippines <em>vs</em>. Irene R. Ombac, Civil Case No. 13555 also of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, upon the grounds that the lands expropriated in said cases, respectively, being:&nbsp; a small parcel of land with an area of 4,626.6 square meters located in Barrio Bonga Mayor, Bustos, Bulacan; a parcel of land situated in Barrio Balbalino, San Carlos, Pangasinan, with an area of 98,970 square meters; and two parcels of land situated in the poblacion of Bugallon, Pangasinan — those lands being situated in places different from those where the lands included in the Hacienda El Porvenir are located, so that their values can not be considered evidentiary facts of the value of the lands comprised in the Hacienda El Porvenir. </p>On the other hand, defendants-appellees Maria Lichauco and Amanda de la Cruz contend that the trial court did not make as basis, much less as the sole basis, the cases mentioned, but considered them simply as a guide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><p> </p>We find plaintiff-appellant's first assigned error untenable.&nbsp; We gather, upon reading, the decision, that the trial court did not base the market value of the Hacienda El Porvenir on the prices of the land expropriated in the case mentioned by the plaintiff-appellant.&nbsp; The trial court simply considered the principles enunciated in those cases as guides in fixing the market value of the lands sought to be expropriated in the present case.&nbsp; The principles regarding evaluation enunciated in the Bustos case, namely:&nbsp; that the reasonable market value of a property is what it would bring when offered for sale by one who desires but is not obliged to sell, and is purchased by one who is under no necessity of having it; that the value of the property should be fixed as of the date of proceedings; and that the sales of properties in the same locality are creditable in determining the market value of lots in that vicinity, can not be said to be erroneous and without basis in law; as claimed by plaintiff-appellant, because said principles are taken from the decisions of this Court in the cases of Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Caligsahan, 40 Phil. 326; and Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs</em>. Fabie, 17 Phil. 206.&nbsp; The trial court, therefore, did not err when it relied on the principles enunciated in those cases. &nbsp; <p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff-appellant discusses jointly the second and third errors assigned.&nbsp; Regarding the second error assigned, plaintiff-appellant contends that the trial court erred in concurring with the majority report on the classification of the lots involved; and regarding the third error assigned, plaintiff-appellant contends that the trial court erred in fixing the fair market value of the different classes of land, giving a total compensation of P4,957,601.86, instead of P1,980,345.00. </p>Regarding lot 7-E, owned by defendant-appellee Amanda L. de la Cruz, plaintiff-appellant claims that the upgrading to second class of the irrigated land, which was classified by Mr. Juvenal Raguini, Real Estate Appraiser of the Land Tenure Administration, as third class, was not supported by the evidence; that the upgrading and reclassification of the 20.1478 hectares classified as hill by Raguini to fourth class sugarland, and the 21.2260 hectares classified as first class upland by Raguini to first class sugar land, was an error, upon the ground that those lands did not have sugar quotas; that the portion classified by Raguini as creeks and canals was erroneously classified by the court as first and second class riceland, because creeks and canals did not produce crops and should not have been given any valuation for purposes of determining the fair market value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><p> </p>Defendants-appellees Maria Lichauco and Amanda de la Cruz, on the contrary, contend that the Commissioners on Appraisal were unanimous in the reclassification of the area marked Exhibit 6-AM in Exhibit A-1 as first class sugar land, and the areas marked Exhibits A-2 and A-8 in Exhibit A-1 as fourth class sugar land as could be seen in the Minority Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and in the Majority Report;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; that even the government expert Raguini testified that the area marked Exhibit 6-AM of Lot 7-E was more adopted to sugar cane such that he would classify it as first class sugar cane land;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; that by soil composition and the use to which they are put, the areas marked Exh. 6-AM and Exhs. A-2 and A-8 were actually first class and fourth class sugar cane lands and actually planted to sugar cane; that during the ocular inspection by the Commissioners, they found that the creek itself was planted to palay; that the river bed mentioned by the plaintiff-appellant was an abandoned river bed, actually a dry land planted to sugar cane, peanuts, mongo and others; that the roads were dirt roads, at the same level as the residential lots and equally suitable for residential purposes; that the valuation of the different kinds of lands was based on the evidence presented; and that neither in the Commissioners' report nor in the decision of the trial court can it be shown that the classification and valuation of the Hacienda El Porvenir was not made at the proper time according to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><p> </p>Regarding the property owned by Jose M. Lichauco, plaintiff-appellant also contends that the upgrading to first class irrigated land of the 1.3861 hectares in Lot 1, which was classified by the government expert as creeks and canals, was erroneous because creeks and canals can not be used for production; that the reclassification to first class upland of the 48.2220 hectares of Lot 7-B which was classified by the government expert as second class upland, and to rolling land of 29.6741 which was classified as hill by the said expert, was without evidentiary support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><p> </p>On the other hand, defendants-appellees Jose M. Lichauco, Trinidad G. Castillo and Francisco and Jose Castillo contend that creeks and canals have beds and form part of the irrigation system that give the land its status as first class irrigated land; consequently, they should have the same classification as the land in which they are found; that it is not true that said creeks and canals are not used for production, because it is a fact that they increase the yield of the land. &nbsp; <p> Anent plaintiff-appellant's contention that the classification by the government expert of the hill should have been maintained, defendants-appellees Jose M. Lichauco, Trinidad Castillo and Francisco and Jose Castillo contend that the classification made by the government expert was, besides being incompetent, not authorized by the court; that there was testimonial evidence showing that the portions classified as hill are really low elevated portions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>Regarding Lot 6, owned by the heirs of Macario H. Lichauco, plaintiff-appellant contends that the upgrading by the trial court to first class irrigated land of the portions classified by the government expert as second class (47.8669 hectares) and third class (47.6852 hectares) was not supported by the evidence; that the upgrading to residential land of the portion (9.0786 hectares) classified by the government expert as roads, as well as that portion (2.4380 hectares) classified as creeks and canals to first class irrigated, was not reasonable; and that the roads and canals as public easements should not be paid for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><p> </p>Counsels for defendants-appellees Mariano F. Lichauco and the heirs of Macario H. Lichauco contends, in connection with Lot 6 owned by the Heirs of Macario H. Lichauco, that the trial court did not in fact upgrade the creeks and canals, but only recognize their inherent quality when they were classified as first class irrigated land; that the feeder roads (which do not include the Tayug-San Quintin provincial road) are privately owned, that they form part of the private property of defendants-appellees and were considered by both parties as portions of the total area under expropriation; that plaintiff's counsel did not interpose any objection, during the field hearings and ocular inspections conducted by the Commissioners, to the upgrading of portions of Lot 6; that the trial court classified Lot 6 on the basis of the findings and recommendations of the Committee on Appraisal, and plaintiff-appellant did not make any objection, neither in its pleadings nor in its consolidated objection to the majority and minority reports, to the reclassification of the portions marked on Exhibit A-1 as 1-RM, 3-RM, 6-RM, 7-RM, 9-RM, 10-RM, 16-RM and 17-RM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><p> </p>But plaintiff-appellant urges that even if the irrigation canals might be considered registrable, they still form part of the amenities already included in the valuation of the property and that without them the valuation of the property should have been lower; that the 17 hectares occupied by roads refer only to provincial and feeder roads excluding the hacienda roads.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><p> </p>Regarding Lot 7-D, property of the heirs of Renato Lichauco, plaintiff-appellant contends that the reclassification of the portions classified by the government expert as creeks and canals to first, second and third class irrigated lands; the upgrading of the roads to residential land, and of the river bed to fourth class sugar land, was not justifiable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><p> </p>Regarding the portions belonging to Trinidad Castillo, Francisco and Jose Castillo, plaintiff-appellant contends that the evidence did not support the upgrading of the second class irrigated ricelands and creeks and canals in Lot 2 to first class irrigated land; that what was stated in the order of the court of February 9, 1963 as referring to Lot 5 should refer to Lot 7-C, and what was stated to refer to Lot 7-C really referred to Lot 5; that regarding Lot 7-C, the upgrading of the 3rd class irrigated land as well as the creeks and canals to first class irrigated land; the upgrading of the 9.2771 hectares of second class upland together with the .5823 hectares of roads to first class upland; the upgrading of the hill with an area of 24.2374 hectares to second class upland; as well as the upgrading of the 23.6284 hectares of river bed as rolling land, were not supported by the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><p> </p>Defendants-appellees Jose M. Lichauco, Trinidad G. Castillo and Francisco and Jose Castillo contend, however, that the reclassification made by the trial court of the areas in Lot 2 was supported by sufficient evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Anent plaintiff-appellant's claim that the roads could not be considered residential land because they were not registrable, defendants-appellees contend that the area occupied by the roads had not been previously expropriated or paid for by the government, and their acreage is included in the certificate of title covering the hacienda.&nbsp; Regarding the reclassification of portions of Lot 7-C, defendants-appellees argue that said reclassification was resorted to by the trial court "in order to cure the defect in both the majority and minority reports which do not mention any river bed, hill or roads." Defendants-appellees further contend that the 23.6284 hectares of river bed was reclassified as rolling lands because such portion is found in the area classified as rolling lands, suitable for sugar cane or other crops production; that the roads were classified as first class irrigated riceland because they were found in first class irrigated rice lands.&nbsp; The alleged "error" pointed to by plaintiff-appellant, stating that while the order of February 9, 1963 states that the amendment on paragraph 23, page 18 of the decision refers to Lot 5 it should actually refer to Lot 7-C and that the amendment on paragraph 19, page 18 of the decision while refering to 7-C should actually refer to Lot 5, is simply a clerical error committed by the typist and not a mistake of fact committed by the trial court, hence there is absolutely no basis for plaintiff-appellant's imputation of "lack of care and scrutiny and failure of the trial court to fully appreciate the matter presented before it for determination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><p> </p>Regarding the share of Mariano Lichauco in Lot 5, plaintiff-appellant contends that the upgrading made by the court of the 15.4957 hectares of second class irrigated land to first class irrigated land, and the 6.8362 hectares of roads to first class irrigated land, as well as the 3.9545 canals and creeks into first class irrigated land, was without basis.&nbsp; Regarding the portion of Lot 7-A of Mariano Lichauco, plaintiff-appellant contends that the evidence does not support the reclassification by the court of the 10.7734 hectares second class upland as first class upland, and the 10.7757 hill as rolling land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><p> </p>Counsel for the heirs of Macario M.H.

El Porvenir", against which memorandum herein defendants-appellants filed their opposition.&nbsp; In its decision, the lower court stated that Mr. Raguini, on complying with the order of the court, exceeded his authority "because he had reclassified the land not in accordance with the report of the commissioners but, perhaps, in accordance with his opinion." Notwithstanding said observation, however, the trial court followed <em>in toto </em>the classification made by Mr. Raguini in the Supplementary Report, Exh. A-1 Supplement, and it thus erred when it found that in Lot No. 7-B only 2.4696 hectares are first class irrigated riceland, 4.1865 hectares are second class irrigated riceland, 48.2220 are first class upland, and 29.6741 hectares are rolling land; and that in Lot No. 7-C there are 21.3487 hectares of first class riceland, 9.8595 of first class upland, 24.2378 hectares of second class upland, and 23.6286 hectares rolling land.&nbsp; These defendants-appellants further contend that said supplementary report was not presented as evidence during the hearings before the Commissioners, and did not, therefore, form part of the competent evidence to be considered by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p> Plaintiff as appellee, on the other hand, contends that although defendants-appellants considered the presentation of Supplementary Report to Exh. A as an error committed by the trial court, it appears that defendants-appellants adopted the same and contest only the correctness of the respective classification of the land made by Mr. Raguini.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p>In reply, defendants-appellants state that they did not adopt the Supplementary Report to Exh. A, as shown by the fact that they submitted their own parcelary plans, Exhibits "1" and "1-A, Trinidad Manolo and Minors."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> <blockquote><p> 10. Regarding the second, third, fourth, and fifth errors assigned, defendants-appellants Jose M. Lichauco, etc., argue that Mr. Raguini classified Lots Nos. 1, 2 and 5 of plan Exhibit "1", from which plan Exh. "A-1" was copied, as first class irrigated land, but he opined that the productivity per hectare was only from 40 to 60 cavanes per hectare basing his opinion on the rates of production found for the different kinds of soil in the books of the College of Agriculture of the University of the Philippines, as set by the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp; These appellants, however, claim that the uncontradicted testimonies of witnesses for the defendants-appellants was that the actual production was from 60 to 85 cavanes per hectare.&nbsp; Mr. Raguini also classified portions of Lots 7-B and 7-C basing their productivity in the books of the College of Agriculture as against the uncontradicted testimonies of defendants-appellants, which parcels are naturally irrigated, unlike the Hacienda Gonzales which was irrigated by pump.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p></blockquote><p> Plaintiff as appellee maintains that defendants-appellants do not claim that the classification by the trial court of Lot 1 owned by Jose Manuel Lichauco as first class land irrigated was erroneous, but only that it should be a special kind of first class irrigated land which should be evaluated at P6,500.00 per hectare, allegedly because the actual production is from 60 to 85 cavanes per hectare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> Regarding Lot 7-B, plaintiff as appellee contends that it was at a loss as to how defendants-appellants arrive at their conclusion and claim that an area of 18.67 hectares should be classified as first class irrigated riceland, to be valued at P5,500 per hectare, and that 15.85 hectares should be considered non-irrigated, riceland to be valued at P4,000 per hectare.&nbsp; In relation to Lot 7-C, plaintiff as appellee also claims that it does not know how defendants-appellants arrived at the size of 37.7912 hectares which the latter-claimed either to be sugar land to be valued at P4,500 per hectare, or rice upland to be valued at P3,000 per hectare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Furthermore, the demand of the defendants-appellants in their motion to dismiss was only P4,000 per hectare.&nbsp; The average price of P5,006.80 given by the trial court for the expropriated lands was already far in excess of the P4,000 per hectare demanded by the defendants-appellants. </p>The first to the fifth errors assigned by defendants-appellants Jose M. Lichauco, Trinidad Gonzales and Francisco and Jose Castillo question the correctness of the finding of the lower court regarding the valuation of the lands owned by them.&nbsp; We have already ruled that the lot classification and the valuation made by the lower court of the lands sought to be expropriated are reasonable and fair, and should not be disturbed. &nbsp; <p> 11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the sixth error assigned by the defendants-appellants, that the trial court should have fixed and determined the fair market value of the disputed excess area, We have already adverted to that the matter of determining the exact area of that excess or "increased area", its classification, its valuation, and the proportionate share of the defendants-appellees are matters that should be determined by the lower court in a hearing specially held for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p>We find that the findings of the lower court regarding the areas or the portions or lots belonging to each of the defendants-appellees and/or their successors in interest, the classification of the lands and the value of the lands according to classification, are supported by the evidence.&nbsp; Excepting possible errors in mathematical computation, the following, based on the findings of the lower court as regards the area, land classification, and valuation per hectare as classified, should be the amounts representing the value of the portions of the Hacienda El Porvenir respectively owned by the defendants-appellees and/or their successors in interest which are expropriated by the plaintiff-appellant:&nbsp; <blockquote><p> A.

The portion of Lot No. 5 pertaining to Mariano Lichauco is 133.65585 hectares, having a value of P728,542.43, thus giving P5450.88 as the value per hectare.&nbsp; The 5000 sq. m., or 1/2 hectare, will then be valued at P2725.44; and deducting this P2725.44 from P1,010,281.23 there will remain P1,007,555.79 as the total value of the land corresponding to Mariano Lichauco.&nbsp; <blockquote>F. <em>OF TRINIDAD CASTILLO GONZALES</em> &nbsp;
