				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>In 1929, the Misamis Lumber Co., Inc. filed a petition (Land Registration 
Case No. 110) for the registration under Act No. 496, of 11 parcels of land 
contiguous to one another, with an area of 709 hectares, located in Misamis (now 
Ozamiz City) Misamis Occidental. Title was premised on alleged deeds of sale 
from Vicente L. Neri and Salvador L. Neri and from Jose K. Ledesma, Conception 
Ledesma and Felicidad Ledesma who acquired the same from its primitive owner 
Simeon Ledesma, a holder of a possessory information title, registered on March 
31, 1894. Opposition was filed by the Attorney General against the registration 
of 5 parcels with an area of 664.6605 hectares on the ground that the same were 
<i>Public</i> lands. More than 58 other private individuals likewise opposed the 
registration alleging ownership over Particular portions of the lot sought to be 
registered. The Supreme Court, on appeal, promulgated on February 21, 1933, a 
decision, dismissing the petition on the finding that at the time the applicant 
(Misamis Lumber Co.) took possession of the land therein, it was covered with 
forest and that the applicant failed to properly identify the land applied for. 
This case is now reported as Misamis Lumber Co. <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, 57 
Phil 881.</p>
<p>On September 3, 1934, the Director of Lands filed Cadastral Proceedings 
docketed as Case No. 17 G.L.R.O. Cad. Rec. No. 1640, covering Lot No. 5308, 
before the CFI of Misamis Occidental, under sec. 1855 of the Adm. Code. On 
August 14, 1935, the Director of Lands filed his claim over 18 lots including 
Lot No. 5308, on the ground that said lots belonged to the <i>public</i> 
domain.</p>
<p>On August 21, 1935, the Misamis Lumber Co., Inc. filed its answer to the said 
petitions claiming ownership over a portion of Lot No. 5308, with a total area 
of 3,711,460 square meters, more or less, basing its ownership thereof on the 
same possessory information title, mentioned in the first case (57 Phil. 881, 
<i>supra</i>).</p>
<p>Before the trial of the cadastral proceedings (Case No. 17) began, <i>Esteban 
Villanueva</i> filed on October 19, 1945, Civil Case No. 859 against Sinforoso 
Tagaytay and 15 others, seeking the recovery of possession and damages from 
them, of a certain parcel of agricultural land included in the area covered by 
the cadastral proceedings, over which Esteban Villanueva asserted ownership. On 
November 12, 1945, defendants answered, alleging that their occupancy of the 
land was based merely on con- tracts of tenancy with Misamis Lumber Co., Inc. 
which was allegedly the owner of the parcel of land claimed by Esteban 
Villanueva. On March 3, 1946, the Misamis Lumber Co. was joined as an 
indispensable party defend- ant. Concepcion Ledesma and Felicidad Ledesma and 
others, were also joined as party defendants. On November 7, 1947, the Director 
of Lands in the Case No. 17, filed a complaint in intervention in the Civil Case 
No. 859, thereby joining Esteban Villanueva, asserting that the lot claimed by 
said Villanueva, was part of the <i>public</i> do- main but covered by <i>sales 
application</i> No. 8210, filed by Villanueva with the Bureau of Lands on June 
22, 1926, for an area of 48 hectares, more or less, which was the" pending 
approval by said Bureau, and that Villanueva d been in actual, peaceful, open, 
<i>public</i> and continuous possession of the said parcel of land, in the 
concept of owner, since 1926 until 1936 or thereabouts, when the defend- ants 
allegedly disturbed his possession and unlawfully deprived him thereof through 
force, threat, strategy and stealth. Answers were filed to the complaint in 
intervention, defendants therein asserting ownership over the land claimed by 
Villanueva.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1948, Esteban Villanueva in Civil Case No. 859, filed his 
separate claims over portions of Lot No. 5808, involved in Cad. Proc. No. 17, 
asserting ownership over said portions, by reason of his sales application in 
the area, of some 503,373 square meters and by purchase from one Jose Medina, 
the alleged previous owner of another portion with an area of some 8 hectares 
inside Lot No. 5308.</p>
<p>On September 17, 1948, a joint trial was held of Cad. Case No. 17 and Civil 
Case No. 859. The CFI of Misamis Occidental rendered decision as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, declaring lot No. 5308 as 
part of the <i>public</i> domain under the control, administration and 
disposition of the Director of Lands and inasmuch its, according to the evidence 
the portion of said lot No. 5308 marked with number 13 in blue pencil in Exhibit 
'X-4' has already been awarded and adjudicated by the Director of Lands to the 
plain- tiff Esteban Villanueva, said portion is now private property of Raid 
Esteban Villanueva, ordering the defendants to vacate said land and to deliver 
its possession to the plaintiff Esteban Villanueva; without special 
pronouncement as to damages and costs, considering that in the opinion of this 
Court the defendants in Civil Case No. 859 had occupied and possessed their 
respective portions of the 'and in question in good faith."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the foregoing judgment, apical was taken by the Misamis Lumber Co. and 
its tenants. Esteban Villanueva, likewise appealed because of the failure of the 
trial court to award him damages, rents, and cost.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals entered the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the judgment a quo is reversed, and another judgment entered:</p>
<p>(1) In CA-G.R. No. L-15472-R (Cad. Case No. 17, G.L.R.O. Record No. 1640), 
adjudicating in favor of the Misamis Lumber Company, Inc. the southern portion 
of Lot 0308 containing an area of 371 hectares, more or less, which is south of 
Capucao river down to Lubolan creek, as shown in the sketch attached to the 
answer of the company; ordering the Director of Lands to segregate the said 
portion from Lot No. 5308, to be known as Lot No. 5308-A; and ordering the 
registration of this segregated portion in the name of the Misamis Lumber 
Company, Inc., Subject, however, to the claims of Elpidio Balodo, Ireneo Campos, 
Simeon Sabrino, Heirs of Moises Gacasan, and Ramon Baomillas, which the company 
has recognized. The record is remanded to the lower court for implementation of 
our judgment and for compliance by the Director of Lands with our order.</p>
<p>(2) In CA-G.R. No. 15473-R (Civil Case No. 859), dismissing the complaint of 
Esteban Villanueva and absolving the defendant-appellant Misamis Lumber 
Company.</p>
<p>No special pronouncement as to costs in both cases."</p></blockquote>
<p>In appealing this case to Us, the appellants submit that the decision of the 
Court of Appeals suffers from two defects, to wit:</p>
<ol><ol type="a"><li>It has completely disregarded the findings of the Supreme Court in the case 
of Misamis Lumber Co. <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, 57 Phil. 881, thereby 
rendering at naught the principle that a matter once definitely adjudged shall 
be considered forever adjudicated between the parties (estoppel by judgment or 
res-adjudicata). 
</li><li>It has overlooked a settled land registration doctrine that only actual 
occupancy and possession of lands with imperfect incomplete title can ripen into 
ownership. </li></ol></ol>
<p>It appears that in <i>Civil Case No. 859</i>, entitled Esteban Villanueva 
versus <i>Misamis Lumber Co., Inc.,</i> et al., and in Cad. Case No. 17, the 
land in issue is the southern portion of Lot No. 5308 of the Misamis Cadastre. 
In Civil Case No. 859, the defendants may be divided into 3 categories: the 
Misamis Lumber Co., Inc. (Company for short), those who were mere tenants of the 
Company and those who claim their respective holdings as their own private 
properties. In Cad. Case No. 17, the oppositors may be classified into 2 
categories: those whose claims and oppositions are based on the contention of 
the Director of Lands that the entire lot 5308 is a <i>public land</i> and those 
who claim their respective holdings as their own individual properties.</p>
<p>The issue, as presented therefore, is whether the land In question is a 
<i>public land</i> subject to Esteban Villanueva's <i>sales application</i> 
which has already been approved and awarded, or is the <i>private property</i> 
of the Company and the other defendants. The Director of Lands maintains that 
the entire lot 5308 is a <i>public land</i> and that the area covered by 
Villanueva's sales application is a portion thereof.</p>
<p>In Cad. Case No. 17, the Company claims only the southern portion of lot 5303 
containing an area of 371 hectares more or less, which is that south of the 
Capucao river down to Lubolan creek, with the Capucao river on the north and 
Lubolan Creek on the south, as its natural and fixed boundaries. The defendant 
Company asks that this portion be segregated to be known or identified as Lot 
5308-A and adjudicated to it. In civil case 859, Villanueva seeks to recover 
from the Company, the possession of a portion of the same southern part of lot 
5308, south of the Capucao river, of an area of about 30 hectares.</p>
<p>As found by the Court of Appeals, Simeon Ledesma acquired a <i>possessory 
information</i> title to a parcel having as natural and fixed boundaries, 
Capucao river on the north and Lubolan creek on the south, containing an area of 
278 hectares, more or less, and situated in barrios Liposong, Dalapang and 
Capucao, Municipality or Misamis (now City of Ozamiz), province of Misamis (now 
Misamis Occidental). The <i>title was registered in the Registry of Deeds of 
Cagayan de Misamis</i> (<i>now Cagayan de Oro City</i>) on March 31, 1894. 
<i>The title states that Simeon Ledesma was in possession of the land since 
1887</i>. The Court of Appeals found that there existed "sufficient reliable 
oral and documentary evidence that he (Simeon Ledesma) was actually in 
possession of the land." From the moment of his death in 1900, the inheritance 
having been accepted in the corresponding intestate proceeding (Exh. 4), the 
title to, and possession of, the land was transmitted to his children, 
Conception, Felicidad and Jose, all surnamed Ledesma. The Court also found that 
there is "sufficient reliable oral and documentary evidence that the said 
children were in actual possession of the land after their father's death." 
<i>On July 28, 1925</i>, by means of a <i>public</i> instrument, the Ledesmas 
sold 2/3 undivided share and interest in the land to Salvador Neri and Vicente 
Luis Neri (Exh. 4) who thereafter sold said share and interest on April 23, 1928 
to the <i>Misamis Lumber Company</i> also by means of a <i>public</i> instrument 
(Exh. 7). The remaining 1/3 undivided share and interest was sold by the 
Ledesmas to the same company on May 31, 1929 by means of a <i>public</i> 
instrument (Exhs. 6 and 8-a). The Court of Appeals, likewise found that the 
evidence "amply shows that the Company took actual possession of a considerable 
portion of the land sold, or an area of about SO hectares, by clearing the area 
of trees and cultivating the same, through tenants." The land was declared for 
taxation purposes by the Ledesmas in 1906 and thereafter (Exhs. 9, 9-a, 9-b, 9-c 
and 9-d) and in 1925 and 1929 by the purchasers, the Neris (Exh. 9-e) and the 
Company (Exhs. 9-g and 9-h).</p>
<p>Predicated, therefore, upon the above findings of facts, to which We are 
bound, it is evident that the possessory information title registered on March 
31, 1894, of Simeon Ledesma could, as it did, ripen into a title of ownership on 
April 1, 1914, that is after 20 years of continuous possession, from the date of 
entry by him and from the moment of his death by his children, there being no 
evidence that the said possession had in the meantime been legally interrupted. 
We said in Smith, Bell &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, 50 Phil. 882;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It may further be noted that unless the defendant's possession of the land 
in the meantime had been legally interrupted the possessory information recorded 
in April, 1804, became convertible into a title in 1914, and Hint therefore the 
land cannot now be considered <i>public</i> and subject to the provision of the 
<i>Public</i> Mineral Land Laws.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner-appellant Villanueva urges that the respondent Court of Appeals 
"has overlooked a settled land registration doctrine that only actual occupancy 
and possession of the land with imperfect-incomplete title can ripen into 
ownership." In the first place, when the Neris, to whom the Ledesmas, as owners, 
had sold on July 28, 1925, 2/3 of the land, conveyed the same to the Company by 
means of a <i>public</i> instrument, and when the Company acquired the remaining 
1/3 of the same land from the Ledesmas on May 31, 1929, also by means of a 
<i>public</i> instrument, such conveyances by symbolic tradition, were coupled 
by immediate possession, for factually, as has been definitely found by the 
Court of Appeals, the Company took actual possession of the land by clearing 30 
hectares and cultivating the same through tenants, in the exercise of its right 
of ownership previously acquired. (Art. 1463, Old Civil Code; Florendo 
<i>vs.</i> Foz, 20 Phil. 388.) And such possession and cultivation of a part, is 
a constructive possession of the whole (Ramos <i>vs.</i> Dir. of Lands, 39 Phil. 
175.), let alone the payment of taxes by the Company and its predecessors, since 
1906, until the present.</p>
<p>Because of the Supreme Court's findings in the case of Misamis Lumber Co. 
<i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, <i>supra</i>, that as late as the year 1925 moat 
of the land involved on the said proceedings with an area of 709 hectares "was 
covered <i>with forest</i>," appellant Villanueva now con- tends that such 
finding "is indicative of the lack of occupancy and possession thereof by the 
Company and its predecessors-in-interest, and that the land was a <i>public</i> 
forest. In that decision, however, there was no finding that it was covered with 
virgin forest (Li Sin Guiap &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, 55 Phil. 
693). The decision said most of the 709 hectares were covered with forest, not 
all. And the possessory information title which was registered on March 31, 1894 
relates that <i>Simeon Ledesma</i><i>was in possession of the land since 
1887</i>. At least there is a strong presumption of possession since 1887, 
arising from such possessory information title.</p>
<p>In this connection, it is further claimed that the land in question is not 
identified with the land described in the possessory information title, because 
of discrepant areas. As found by the Court of Appeals, the pertinent oral and 
documentary evidence sufficiently establish the identity of the land. It is 
quite true that the possession information title described the land, as 
containing an estimated area of 278 hectares, according to the Spanish plan, and 
having as natural and fixed boundaries Capucao river on the north and Lubolan 
creek on the south. This land has a computed area of 371 hectares, according to 
the cadastral plan of that portion of lot 5308 south of the Capucao river down 
to Lubolan creek (sketch Exh. 17, attached to the answer of the Company). The 
configuration of the land in both the Spanish plan and the cadastral plan, the 
existence of the natural and fixed boundaries, and the oral and documentary 
evidence of record show the identity of the land. (Sideco <i>vs.</i> Heirs of 
Balajadia, et al., 65 Phil. 364.) The difference between 371 and 278 or 93 
hectares, areas shown in the two surveys, is attributable to the fact that the 
area in the Spanish survey was <i>estimate</i>d, while the area in the Bureau of 
Lands survey was actually computed. The difference in this case is smaller than 
that encountered in Smith, Bell<i>vs.</i> Dir. of Lands (509 Phil. 882) which 
was 167 hectares (667 minus 500), between the old and the new survey. In the 
latter case, the registration of the land involved therein was ordered. And this 
must be so, because a piece of land is generally and better identified by its 
natural and fixed boundaries, such as creeks and rivers, like the present case, 
and not by its actual area. There are, of course, changes in the boundarymen of 
the land in question, particularly on the east and west. It should be noted, 
however, that more than 35 years had elapsed between the two surveys; "the 
population in the locality was of unsettled character," and the many changes of 
adobe would be likely to occur. (Smith, Bell &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Dir. of Lands, 
<i>supra</i>.) Hermogenes Mejia, a licensed land surveyor who made a survey of 
the land in June and July of 1926, and whose survey was approved by the Acting 
Director of Lands on January 22, 1929 (Exh. 2), testified that the land 
mentioned in the possessory information title, is the land in question.</p>
<p>And even if there had been no registered possessory information title over 
the land, the Company's continuous possession, in the concept of owner, tacked 
to that of its predecessors-in-interest, which had begun as far back as 1887, is 
sufficient to confer upon it effective title of ownership which is registerable 
under the land registration laws. (Ch. VI, Act No. 926, as amended by Act No. 
2874; Susi <i>vs.</i> Razon and Dir. of Lands, 48 Phil. 424.) Premises 
considered, We hold that when Villanueva's sales application was filed with the 
Bureau of Lands on June 22, 1926 or thereabouts, the land in question was 
already a private property of the Misamis Lumber Company, the pronouncements of 
the Bureau of Lands or the Bureau of Forestry, to the contrary 
notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Appellant Villanueva lastly claims that the decision in the said case of 
Misamis Lumber Co. <i>vs.</i> Dir. of Lands, <i>supra</i>, estoppel by judgment 
or <i>res adjudicata</i>, now operates against the Company in the present case, 
because this Court in said civil case found that "as late as the year 
<i>1925</i>, most of the land involved in the present proceedings, with an area 
of 709 hectares, according to the opposition presented by the Director of Lands 
and also according to the decision of the court below, was covered with forest * 
* *; "that at the time the applicant took possession of the land in question it 
was covered with forest," the determination of the fact of occupancy, in said 
case is definitive and conclusive. In other words, appellee can not now validly 
claim that it had ever had actual possession or occupancy of the land earlier 
than 1925 and, therefore, what the possessory information title states that 
since 1887, Simeon Ledesma began possessing or occupying the land, lacks 
verity.</p>
<p>It should be recalled, however, that the denial of the application therein 
was principally based on the ground that the applicant failed to properly 
identify the land applied for. Whereas the possessory information title on which 
the Company based its claim showed an area of only 278 hectares, the area 
applied for was 668 hectares or almost 2-1/3 times as large. It cannot be 
gainsaid the fact that the denial of the application on that ground, was without 
prejudice. Moreover, it can not be said that the area covered with forest in 
that big tract of land mentioned in the former case, is the very same area 
identified as part of lot No. 5308, object of the present proceedings. The said 
decision states <i>most</i> (not all) of the area involved therein was covered 
with forest. It was not specified whether <i>any of the area</i> covered with 
forest, is the one now under consideration. Verily, there being no identity of 
the subject matter, the defense of estoppel by judgment or<i> res judicata</i> 
fails.</p>
<p>With respect to the area of 30 hectares, subject of the suit to recover 
possession, in civil case 859, claimed by Villanueva, to have been purchased by 
him under a miscellaneous sales application from the Bureau of Lands* We have 
examined the pertinent documentary evidence mid We agree, on the basis thereof, 
with the Director of Lands, that it is a part of lot 5308. However, it is the 
same* area that the Misamis Lumber Company cleared of trees and cultivated 
through tenants, soon after it purchased two-thirds of the land in 1925, and is 
part of the land acquired by the said company from the Ledesma children through 
the Neri brothers. In view hereof, Villanueva’s action in civil case 859 to 
recover possession of 30 hectares of land from the Company must necessarily 
fall, for it is obvious that the Bureau of Lands could not validly sell land 
which was not part of the <i>public</i> domain, land which already belonged to a 
private person, in this case, the Misamis Lumber Company (Garcia <i>vs.</i> 
Dinero, 80 Phil., 474; Lecaste <i>vs.</i> Dir. of Lands, 63 Phil., 654; Lizaga 
<i>vs.</i> Omauano, 59 Phil, 547, 555).</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, should 
be, as it is hereby affirmed with costs against petitioner-appellant Esteban 
Villanueva.</p>
<p><i>Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Dizon, Barrera, Regala, Bengzon, J. P.</i> 
and <i>Zaldivar, JJ.</i> concur.</p>
