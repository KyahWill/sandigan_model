civil case 7495.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 12, 1960 Chua <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hun <u>alias</u>
Chua <span class="SpellE">Fek</span> Hun <u>alias</u> Tsai <span class="SpellE">Bek</span>
Yuen and her minor son, Tan Ka Ho, executed before the Philippine Consul in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, affidavits in support of their respec­tive
applications for temporary visitor's visas to the Philippines, which affidavits
read in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That I am applying for temporary visi­tor's
visa to the Philippines to visit my husband [father], Tan <span class="SpellE">Hui</span>
Long <span style="">@ </span>Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liong</span>, a Chinese permanent resident merchant of the
Philippines and residing at No. 1888 M. del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Street, Manila;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That while in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
I shall never apply for a change of status from tempo­rary visitor; and </blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That I shall only stay in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for ninety (90) days, unless otherwise ex­tended by the proper
authorities."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 15, 1960 the a forenamed mother and son and Tan Ka
Pin, another minor son (all hereinafter referred to as the petitioners),
arrived in Manila, aboard a PAL plane from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>,
and were admitted (in immigration cases 21801-E to 21803-E) for a stay of three
months upon their posting a cash bond in the sum of P24, 000.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1960</st1:date>
the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision in naturalization
case 42268 granting the peti­tion for naturalization of Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the Secreta­ries of Foreign Affairs and Justice, in their <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of December 2 and December 6, 1960,
respectively, allowed the peti­tioners a change of category from that of
temporary visitors to that of special non-immigrants under sec. 47(a)(2) of the
Immigra­tion Act of 1940, and extended their stay in the Philippines until
October 21, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Bureau of Immigration, however, subsequently re­fused to
receive the petitioners' tendered extension fees for the period following <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liong</span> filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1962</st1:date> with the Court of First Instance of Manila
a complaint for <i style="">mandamus</i> and
prohibition with mandatory injunc­tion and preliminary injunction against the
Bureau of Immigration, docketed therein as civil case 51343.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said complaint was, however, dismissed by
the court on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1962</st1:date>,
which dismissal became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> in view of
the withdrawal by the petitioner therein of his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1963</st1:date>, the Court of First Ins­tance of Manila (Branch X) denied
Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong's</span> motion to
take his oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He appealed this order of
denial to this Court which af­firmed said order and denied his petition for
naturalization.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 10, 1962 the Commissioner of Immigration (hereinafter
referred to as the respondent) confiscated the peti­tioners' cash bond and
declared it forfeited in favor of the Philip­pine Government, and, on December
17, 1962, issued a warrant for their arrest to effect their deportation from
the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, on <st1:date year="1962" day="26" month="12">December 26, 1962</st1:date>, filed with the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> civil case 7495,
which is a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction against the
respondent, to enjoin him and his agents from causing their arrest,
confinement, a deportation, as well as the confiscation of their cash
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
issued on the same day a restraining order and scheduled the hearing on the
application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to dismiss with opposition to
preliminary injunction was filed by the respondent on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">But in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 8, 1963</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> the trial court denied the said motion and ordered the respondent
to file his answer.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties submitted a complete stipulation of facts on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="9" month="10">October
 9, 1964</st1:date> the trial court issued an order dismissing the petition, with
costs against the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
restraining order previously issued was ordered lifted and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lone issue tendered for resolution is, have the peti­tioners
acquired the right to remain in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
beyond the authorized period of their stay?</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners premise their alleged right to prolong their stay
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the naturalization case of Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>, the husband and
father, and on the possi­bility that the latter may eventually be granted
Philippine citizen­ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
apparent from the arguments which they advance with some degree of
vehemence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the petitioner Chua <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hun <u>alias</u> Chua <span class="SpellE">Pek</span> Hun
<u>alias</u> Tsai <span class="SpellE">Bek</span> Yuen argues that she has the
inchoate legal right to be admitted for permanent residence in the Philippines
under sec. 13(b) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, upon
the admission of her husband as a naturalized Filipino citizen, subject to her
compliance with the last paragraph of section 9 of the said Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the petitioners Tan Ka
Ho and Tan Ka Pin, both minors then but now of age,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
assert that they have the inchoate legal right to be considered as Filipino
citizens upon the admission of their father as a naturalized Filipino citizen,
and therefore are entitled to stay so that they may enroll in a public or
private school recog­nized by the Government wherein Philippine history,
government, and civics are taught or prescribed, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the naturalization case of their father, to enable the latter to comply with
sec. 2, paragraph 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, even the Secretaries of Foreign
Affairs and Justice based their decision to extend the petitioners' stay in the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
until <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1962</st1:date>,
upon the fact that Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong's</span>
peti­tion for naturalization had been granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their respective <span class="SpellE">indorse­ments</span> extended the
period of stay to October 21, 1962 because "... the petition of their
husband/father, Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span>,
for na­turalization as Philippine citizen has been granted by the Court of
First Instance of Manila in its decision dated October <span style="">21, 1960, </span>which has not been appealed,"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and "The herein petitioners will become citizens by operation of law, if
otherwise qualified, when the decision of the court becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
after two years from its promulgation, pursuant to Republic Act No. 530."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong's</span>
motion to be allowed to take his oath as a naturalized Filipino citizen,
however, was denied by the Court of First Instance of Manila on <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1963</st1:date>, which order of
denial was affirmed by this Court on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1966</st1:date> in <u>Tan </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Huy</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> v. Republic</span></u><span style="">, </span><u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This final denial of Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liong's</span> petition for naturalization has completely
removed the props of the petitioners' argument that they have acquired the
right to re­main in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
beyond the authorized period of their stay because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of their husband/father Tan <span class="SpellE">Huy</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong's</span>
naturalization case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, since the
authorized extension of their stay in the Philippines expired <span style="">on </span>October 21, 1962, their conti­nued
presence in this country has become illegal, rendering them liable to arrest,
with resultant confiscation of their bond, and subsequent deportation in
accordance with section 37(a)(7) of the Immigration Act of 1940, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 37.</span> (a) The following aliens
shall be arrested upon the warrant of the Commissioner of Immigration or of any
other officer designated by him for the purpose and deported upon the warrant
of the Commissioner of Immigration after a deter­mination by the Board of
Commissioners of the existence of the ground for deportation as charged against
the alien:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(7)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any alien who remains in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in violation of any limitation or condition un­der which he was admitted as a non-<span class="GramE">immigrant.</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Verily,
respondent can now </span>legally order the arrest and cause peti<span style="">tioners </span>as well <span style="">as </span>the confiscation of <span style="">cash bond in favor of </span>the Philippine
Government.</p>
