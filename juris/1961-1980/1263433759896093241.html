Jr. is one of four persons charged with robbery with homicide in the Court of
First Instance of Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only two were
convicted; namely, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>,
Jr. who was meted the death penalty, and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>
who was sentenced to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Destuir</span> was acquitted, while <span class="SpellE">Rogito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Leyso</span> jumped bail before the prosecution rested, and
has not yet been brought back to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The death sentence of <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>, Jr. (hereinafter referred to as appellant) is
before this Court for automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's main defense in the trial court was alibi, and <span class="SpellE">corrolarily</span> thereto, that he had not been sufficiently
identified as one of the <span class="SpellE"><u>participis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He,
therefore, does not dispute the facts as established by the evidence of the
prosecution, except only to deny that the acts imputed to him in the narration
of the details of the commission of the crime were his acts, in line with his
aforementioned defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recital of
the facts in the People's Brief may, therefore, be quoted, and on the basis
thereof, the veracity of appellant's defense will be properly evaluated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 10:00 o'clock in the morning of June 12, 1967, the
deceased Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> and his wife Lydia <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, boarded a passenger bus, Mercedes-Benz No. 56, at <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, bound for their hometown, <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>, and seated themselves behind the driver, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Argente</span> (pp. 2, 4, 18, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; pp. 2, 3, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; pp. 5, 6, 12, 16, 22, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Along the way, at about 11:00 o'clock that same morning, at <span class="SpellE">Gines</span> <span class="SpellE">Patag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>,
Iloilo, the appellant <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>,
Jr., alias Jimmy, who was at the roadside, <span class="SpellE">signalled</span>
the bus to stop (pp. 2, 3, 9, 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; pp. 3, 4, 12, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; pp. 6, 17, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus
stopped (p. 3, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>;
p. 5, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; p.
7, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant then posted himself in front of
the bus, aimed his revolver at the driver, and said, "This is a
holdup" (pp. 3, 4, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>;
pp. 4-6, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>;
pp. 7, 22, 29, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneously, the accused Cesar <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span> sprang out from a bamboo grove, approached the left
side of the bus, and aimed his <span class="SpellE">pugak</span>-hang, a
home-made gun, at the passengers (pp. 5, 22, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; pp. 8, 9, 26, 30, 31, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
that same time, the accused <span class="SpellE">Rogito</span> <span class="SpellE">Leyso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Destuir</span>, also sprang out from bushes of <span class="SpellE">agoho</span>
trees on the right, approached the bus, and aimed their guns at the passengers
(pp. 5, 6, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>;
pp. 9, 10, 30, 31, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant then went to the door on the
right side of the bus, boarded it, and said, "If you have the money give
them all to us so that nobody will get killed" (pp. 4, 5, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; pp. 5, 6, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; pp. 18, 30, 31, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that terse announcement, the appellant,
with his left hand collected from the conductor and passengers their money,
wrist watches, rings and necklaces, while his right hand held his gun (pp. 5,
8, 12, 13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Lydia <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>,
the appellant took a solitaire worth P85.00 (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; p. 12, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>), and from the deceased the amount of P25.00 (p. 5,
<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; p. 7, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant also felt the waist of the
deceased, and finding a revolver, took it (pp. 5, 6. 17, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; pp. 8, 9, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the appellant was thus collecting the loot, his aforesaid three
cohorts stood about the bus with their <span class="SpellE">pugak</span>-hangs
aimed at the passengers (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; p. 10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After taking the revolver of the deceased, the appellant
alighted but turned about, and with one foot on the running board and the other
on the ground, shot the deceased inside the bus, hitting him on the right
temple (pp. 6, 7, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>;
p. 10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After shooting the deceased, the appellant
ran away into the bushes of <span class="SpellE">agoho</span> trees, followed by
his said cohorts (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. F, F-1 to F-3, pp. 393-396,
rec.; p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>;
p. 10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shooting of the deceased shocked his wife
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Lydia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and she
screamed (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>;
p. 11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>; p.
14, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Tabares</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The bus then continued on its way to <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>,
whereat the deceased was brought to the clinic of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catedral</span>, who gave him emergency treatment, then
rushed him to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Mission</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, at <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> (pp. 6, 7, 17, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>; pp. 11,
163-168, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased died that same day at said
hospital (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B, C, pp. 8, 13, rec.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Mariano D. <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>, Rural
Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Zarraga</span>, Iloilo, autopsied the body
of the deceased on June 13, 1967, at the <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span> <span class="SpellE">Sola</span> Mia, at <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>, Iloilo,

<p class="BODY">In pleading his defense of alibi, appellant denies being the
person pointed to by the state witnesses as having given the signal to the bus
to stop, collected cash and other valuables from the passengers, particularly
from the spouses, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> and Lydia <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, including a revolver which he grabbed from Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro's</span> waist, and shot to death the latter after divesting
him of his firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contends, in his
lone assignment of error,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that his identity as the villain that he had been so portrayed has not been
established to warrant his conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now firmly established in our jurisprudence, by a long line
of decisions, that alibi is unavailing once the accused is positively
identified by one without motive to charge falsely said accused, specially with
a grave offense that could bring death by execution on the culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant having been identified by three
prosecution witnesses as having had not only participation but the leading role
in the commission of the dastardly crime, We have only to examine and
scrutinize the testimony of said witnesses for truth and veracity to assess the
worth of appellant's alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter's
efforts have, in fact, been directed mainly, if not solely, at an attempt to
show the lack of trustworthiness of his identification by the prosecution
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, appellant tries to discredit the testimony of Lydia <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> by showing supposedly glaring and irreconcilable
contradictions between her sworn statement during the preliminary investigation
conducted on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1967</st1:date>,
and her affidavit executed on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="6">June 17,
 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He quotes from the
first statement before the Municipal Judge, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Q - Can you recognize those persons who went
up the bus?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - I cannot recognize
them but the one who shot Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> was wearing a
mask, slender in built with stooping posture."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From her affidavit, appellant also quotes the following:</p>

<blockquote>"that while we were near Km. 30 at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Tigbuan</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> we were held up
by six persons armed with guns <u>whose appearance I could identify if I have
the chance to see them again</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
one person took TWENTY FIVE PESOS (P25.00), from my husband and a ring from me
worth EIGHTY FIVE PESOS (P85.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
after he took those from us they grabbed the .38 Cal. Revolver of my husband
and after taking it by force <u>one person shot my husband and he was hit on
the right side of his head which cause the death of my husband</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">First of all, appellant calls attention to the fact that what was
marked as Exhibits 1 and 1-A for appellant is not the affidavit of <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1967</st1:date>, but the sworn
statement during the preliminary investigation of <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He,
therefore, charged the trial court with error in considering the affidavit as
the evidence offered by appellant and marked Exhibits 1 and 1-A, instead of the
sworn statement given during the preliminary investigation, and citing in its
decision what was stated in the affidavit, not what was stated in the sworn
statement above referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">What appellant seems to have overlooked is that Lydia <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, testifying as a witness for the defense, identified
and affirmed her affidavit.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In said affidavit, she declared that she could identify the appearance of the
hold uppers "if I have the chance to see them again," as she did
actually identify and point to the appellant during the investigation by the
police and during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As a defense witness, she also testified that she saw the face of the person
who shot her husband, because the former was not wearing a mask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pointed at appellant as the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Presented as a defense witness, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Lydia</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
testimony as such may not be repudiated by appellant, for he is supposed to
vouch for the credibility of any witnesses he offers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from Lydia <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, two other
passengers of the bus, Juan <span class="SpellE">Aldabon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Compaña</span>, both of whom
knew appellant, specially the first of these two witnesses who had known
appellant for quite a long time, identified appellant as the one who <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> the bus to stop, pointing a revolver at the
driver, collected cash and other valuables from the passengers, took forcibly
the gun of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, and shot the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Significantly, appellant did not take the witness stand to refute the positive
identification of him as one of the four armed participants in the commission
of the crime, with the most heinous act of them all, that of shooting a man in <span class="SpellE">coldblood</span>, a clear act of treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Band and treachery were thus present to
aggravate the crime committed, as found by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With appellant having been so positively identified as the actual
killer of the deceased by witnesses not shown to have any improper motive to
charge him falsely with so grave an offense as that with which he was indicted,
his defense of alibi is totally shattered.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
His claim of being in Sta. Barbara in the morning of June 12, 1967 when the
crime was committed towards noon of that day cannot fortify his alibi,
considering that the distance of only about 13 kilometers to the scene of the
crime, as admitted by defense witness Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Camora</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
can easily be negotiated by a motor vehicle ride, in time for appellant to be at
the scene, and during the commission of the crime at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> found "that the commission of
the crime charged herein was attended by several aggravating circumstances
having been committed by a band with the use of unlicensed firearms thereby
violating another law and stopping a public vehicle in an uninhabited
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another circumstance is treachery
when one of their victims was shot on his right temple resulting into his death
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bautil</span>, et al., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18997, </span><st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1"><span class="GramE">Jan. 31, 1966</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, Advance Decision)."</span>
But I do not believe that this is supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="NUM">(a) Band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it is
alleged that all four defendants were armed, yet one of them, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Destuir</span> was
acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This leaves only three of the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a band is defined as more
than three armed malefactors (Art. 14, par. 6, R.P.C.) The resulting number,
therefore, falls short of the definition.</p>

<p class="NUM">(b) Uninhabited place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record is bereft of any evidence to show that the <span class="SpellE">situs</span>
of the crime was an uninhabited place.</p>

<p class="NUM">(c) Treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere act
of shooting a person does not constitute treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case the mode of attack, among
other factors, must be consciously adopted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no such evidence in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tumaob</span>, 83 Phil. 742; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Saez</span>, 1 SCRA 937; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>,
84 Phil. 771)</p>

<p class="BODY">For the above reasons, I believe the appropriate penalty is <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the judgment convicting <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Estante</span>, Jr. of robbery with homicide but I dissent
as to the imposition of the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos that the imposable penalty is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
because the aggravating circumstances of treachery, band, and <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span> were not proven.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the robbery with homicide, which is punished by <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> to death, was not attended by any
mitigating and aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the lesser penalty should be imposed (Arts. 63[2] and
294[1], Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the two briefs filed for <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>, Jr., the principal argument of his two lawyers is
that he was not identified with certitude as the person who shot the victim,
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victim's wife, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Mallada</span> <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, in her affidavit declared that she would be able to
identify the person who shot her husband if she saw him again (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-Estante, p. 3, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, at the preliminary examination conducted by the
municipal judge, she declared that she could not recognize the persons who held
up the bus and that the malefactor who shot her husband was wearing a mask (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2-Estante, p. 18, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>,
in his statement to the police, did not implicate <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>
in the robbery with homicide (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, three eyewitnesses, Lydia M. <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>,
Juan <span class="SpellE">Aldabon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Serviliano</span>
<st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Campania</span></st1:place></st1:state>,
all bus passengers, identified <span class="SpellE">Estante</span> as the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span> who robbed and shot Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Aldabon</span> testified at the
preliminary examination, he declared that <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>,
alias Jimmy, got the revolver of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> and
with his (<span class="SpellE">Estante's</span>) revolver shot <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> (pp. 11-12, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lydia M. <span class="SpellE">Forro</span> was called by the
defense as a hostile witness and was confronted with the statement in her
affidavit that the person who shot her husband was wearing a mask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>
categorically declared that that statement in her affidavit was a mistake (37 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="1">January 30,
 1968</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">She said that the person who shot her husband was not wearing a
mask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She clarified that when she signed
her statement given at the preliminary examination, she did not read it (37,
39-40, <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1968</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The complicity of <span class="SpellE">Estante</span> in the
robbery with homicide (in fact, he was the author of that crime) was proven
beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estante</span> did not testify to refute the
testimonies of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Forro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aldabon</span>
and <st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Campania</span></st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prove his alibi, <span class="SpellE">Estante</span>
presented a witness who declared that he (<span class="SpellE">Estante</span>)
was in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>plaza</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Sta.
  Barbara</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
when the shooting at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Gines</span> <span class="SpellE">Patag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city>
occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another witness, Vicente Ramos, testified that he was a passenger
in the bus that was held up and that <span class="SpellE">Estante</span> was not
among the group of malefactors who robbed the passengers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that <span class="SpellE">Estante's</span>
alibi was a pure fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estante's</span> lawyers did not even bother to discuss his
defense of alibi in their briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the evidence of the prosecution does not establish the
aggravating circumstances of band, treachery and <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the information, band and abuse of superiority were
alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery and <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span> were not alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly rationalized by Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, band, <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span>
and treachery cannot be appreciated in this case.</p>
