				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The present case <span style="">involves
</span>the implementation of the judgment of this Court in G. R. No. L-6306,
promulgated May 26, 1954, <span style="">ordering
defendant Ricardo Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Lloret</span> to pay plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> "the sum of
P</span>100<span class="GramE">,000</span> which should be adjusted in accordance
with the <span class="SpellE">Ballantyne</span> scale of <span style="">values."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Execution </span>of the
judgment was first sought by plaintiff on July 15, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant opposed, al足leging that the
judgment was incomplete since it did not specify the date on which the <span class="SpellE">Ballantyne</span> scale should be applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court stayed execution and
suggested that plaintiff have the matter clarified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly he filed a motion for that
purpose before this Court, but it was denied on the ground that the judgment
had already become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proceedings continued below, where an order was issued on <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1958</st1:date>, sustaining plaintiff's
contention that the conversion into Philippine currency of the amount awarded
in the judgment should be according to the scale of values in June 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion for reconsideration by defendant,
however, the order was modified on <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1958</st1:date>, adopting the scale as of August 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the previous order the amount stated in
the judgment is equivalent to P6<span class="GramE">,666.33</span>; under the
amendatory one it <span style="">is </span>equivalent
to P4,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff insists on June 1944 <span style="">as
</span>the material conversion period; defendant says it should be January
1945, when the converted value was only P833.33.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1954 decision of this Court reveals the fol足lowing pertinent
facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sum of P100<span class="GramE">,000</span>
awarded therein represents a partial payment or deposit made by plaintiff to
defendant Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Lloret</span> on six parcels of land
owned by the intestate estate of which the latter was administrator, which were
the subject of negotiations for their sale wherein plaintiff, as prospective
vendee, was represented by Attorney <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sauco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The check for
said amount was delivered to Gonzales <span class="SpellE">Lloret</span> in June
1944 and deposited by him to his bank account forthwith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The negotiations, </span>however, fell through
before the contract of sale could be perfected, and suit for recovery was
commenced after the war, culminating in the judgment now sought to be
implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the issue was resolved correctly by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> in its amendatory order of <st1:date year="1958" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decision in
the main case is clear enough when it said:</p>

<blockquote>"According to the evidence, when the transaction was called
off because of the failure of <span class="SpellE">Sauco</span> to appear on the
date set for his last conference with <span class="SpellE">Lloret</span>, the
latter attempted to return the said amount to <span class="SpellE">Sauco</span>
on August 2, 1944, who declined to accept it on the pretext that he had another
buyer who was willing to purchase the lands for the sum of P500<span class="GramE">,000</span> and that if that sale were carried out <span class="SpellE">Lloret</span> could just deduct that amount from the purchase
price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That offer to return, in our
opinion, cannot have the effect of relieving <span class="SpellE">Lloret</span>
from liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His duty was to consign
it in court as required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
failure to do so makes him answerable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> to <span style="font-size: 12pt;">the plaintiff which he is now
in duty bound to pay subject to adjustment under the <span class="SpellE">Ballantyne</span>
Scale of Values."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The duty to make the consignation in court arose when the offer
to return the money was not accepted - which was in August 1944; and it was
defendant's failure to perform that duty that made him "answerable to
plain足tiff," the precise extent of his liability to be sub足ject to
adjustment under the <span class="SpellE">Ballantyne</span> Scale of values.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words it was the liability as of
that time - August 1944 - that should be adjusted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June 1944 no liability had yet attached
and so the conversion rate as of that month cannot be applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it would have been unjust
and inequitable for defendant to wait (as he now says he could have done) until
January 1945 before making the consignation of the money in court, knowing as
he did that the Japanese war currency was fast depreciating in value and
considering that, after all, defendant may be presumed to have used and
benefited from that money in August 1944, when it was worth considerably more
than in January 1945.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
