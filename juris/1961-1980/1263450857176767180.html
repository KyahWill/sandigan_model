by Mrs. Harden to discontinue the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1952" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1952</st1:date>,
Recto filed a motion <span style="">in </span>the Su­preme Court to establish his attorney's charging

 </span>1952</st1:date>, remanded the case to the trial court to determine the
amount of Recto's attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
all the ancillary writs and processes issued in the case were dissolved except
the receivership on the conjugal properties, which was maintained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the lower court, af­ter
hearing, held that Recto was entitled to P384,110.97 as counsel fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Harden appealed to this Court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<span style="">Recto moved for execution </span>of the

by the Hardens in this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1958</st1:date>, We upheld Recto
once more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finally enabled the
latter to levy upon the stocks and other properties of the Hardens, the public
sales of which realized <span style="">P100,805.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>A balance of P203,305.97 thus remained
in Recto's favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1958</st1:date>,
Recto moved <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>to
levy on other shares of stock owned by the Hardens but registered in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>, including the 410,638 shares <span style="">in the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>

in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His </span>motion
to recon­sider the denial also met the same fate, the lower court holding that <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> did not own the said <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
shares of stock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> appealed to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
We dismissed the same on <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="12">December 22,
 1958</st1:date><span style="">, </span>for being fri­volous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to reconsider subsequently filed
failed to save the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1959</st1:date>, the said 410,638
shares were sold <span style="">at </span>public

were under receivership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>, the lower court issued
an order requiring <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> to "turn over to

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1958" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1958</st1:date>,
Recto moved for a writ of exe­cution to implement the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July <span style="">1, </span>1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was approved on <st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> filed a

410,638 shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1959</st1:date>, the low­er court ordered <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> to comply with the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date> by depositing P20,531.90 in the
Commercial Bank &amp; Trust Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter moved for reconsideration al­leging, <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that he had spent P45,900.99 as ex­penses for
the Hardens from 1955 to 1957 and for which he must be reimbursed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this was denied, a second motion to
reconsider was filed, <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> claiming that the
P20,531.90 cash dividends had already been disbursed for the benefit of the
Harden family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1961</st1:date>, the lower court, after hearing
and presentation of evi­dence, denied the second motion to reconsider, holding
that the alleged incurring of expenses by <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>
was a mere afterthought concocted by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Preliminary steps were taken by <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>
to appeal this order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1960" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1960</st1:date>, Recto died and his
wife, as his <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>, was substituted as
claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1961</st1:date>, the lower court required <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> to submit a P25,000.00 <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond to pre­vent execution pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This compelled <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> to abandon the
intended appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1961</st1:date>, he deposited P20,531.90 in the
bank in compliance with the order of <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1961</st1:date>, Mrs. Rec­to, with
court approval, withdrew P25,000.00 from the Har­den funds under receivership
in the bank, thus reducing the judgment balance to P30,624.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1961" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1961</st1:date>,
Mrs. Recto moved for full com­pliance with the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July <span style="">1, </span>1957</st1:date>
to satisfy the remaining judgment balance, relying upon a statement<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
issued by the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Consolidated that from <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1950</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1955" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1955</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>
had received all the cash divi­dends on the P410,638 shares, amounting to
P60,797.29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­solving the motion and
opposition interposed by <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>, the lower court
on <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1962</st1:date>
ordered <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> to deposit P30,624.00 in the
Commercial Bank and Trust Compa­ny for final satisfaction of the judgment
balance in Rec­to's favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the
incident under the present appeal, first taken to the Court of Appeals but
subsequently cer­tified to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> first submits that
the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>
which is sought to <span style="">be </span>fully
enforced did not include the cash dividends received by him before <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1955</st1:date> since Recto's
motion of <st1:date year="1957" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1957</st1:date> was
limited to those dividends received after said date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is with­out merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July <span style="">1, </span>1957</st1:date>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Finding the said petition to be well founded this Court
hereby orders Jose <span class="SpellE">Salum­bides</span> to turn over to the
Receiver, Atty. Juan S. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> all the dividends that he
has already received from the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Consoli­dated
Mining Company, Inc."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">clearly includes all dividends received
as of then by <span class="SpellE">Sa­lumbides</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
Consolidated statement dated <st1:date year="1957" day="5" month="4">April 5,
 1957</st1:date> shows that the cash dividends on the 410,638 shares from <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1950</st1:date> to July 1955 had also
been de­livered to and already received by <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the lower court found, in its order of <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1961</st1:date>, that <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> never appealed the order of <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the same can no longer be questioned now.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> would also argue that those
dividends had already been disbursed by him for the benefit of the Har­den
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question, however, had
already been raised and argued <u>twice</u> before the lower court which tried
and decided it adversely in the order of <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> filed his notice of appeal
and appeal bond, the appeal was never really pursued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1961</st1:date>, he manifested to the lower court that
he had already complied with the order of <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1961</st1:date>, thus making the same final and conclusive
as against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defenses of (a) bar by prior judgments, (b) pres­cription,
extinctive and acquisitive, (c) <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, and (d)
waiver, set up by <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span>, are without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the first, he would rely upon the lower
court's orders of <st1:date year="1953" day="7" month="12">De­cember 7, 1953</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1956" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1956</st1:date>, which
declared that the receivership did not include future dividends on the shares
of stock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the more recent order of <st1:date year="1961" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1961</st1:date> expressly declared
these orders erroneous and already superseded and reversed by the later court
orders of <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="12">De­cember 14, 1955</st1:date>,
<st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1958" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1958</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There could be no prescription, extinctive or acqui­sitive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the period for bringing the action be
five years as appellant suggests, still the same has not yet lapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dividends being litigated were declared
from <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1950</st1:date> <span style="">to </span><st1:date year="1955" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But

asking for the dividends and claim­ant's motions of <st1:date year="1953" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1953</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="12">December <span style="">15, </span>1955</st1:date>,

effect, seasonably interrupted the prescriptive pe­riod.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These extrajudicial and judicial demands also
nega­tive <span class="SpellE">laches</span> on claimant's part.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> could not acquire the
dividends in ques­tion by prescription since he possessed them, not in con­cept
of owner, adverse to the Hardens, but rather as attorney-in-fact of <span style="">Mr. </span>Harden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He first claimed owner­ship only in his
omnibus opposition dated <st1:date year="1957" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But two years later, or on <st1:date year="1959" day="24" month="8">August <span style="">24,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>in his
motion to reconsider, <span class="SpellE">Salumbides</span> admitted that these
dividends belonged to the Hardens.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is Recto's demand for the P20,531.00 cash dividends which
were declared from <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="12">December <span style="">14, 1955</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>to <st1:date year="1956" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1956</st1:date>, a waiver of the previous
dividends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely wanted to satisfy
his judgment credit from among any of the Harden assets available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the later divi­dends failed to fully
satisfy the judgment, Recto could still enforce his valid claim against the
previous divi­dends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the cash
dividend of <st1:date year="1955" day="3" month="10">October 3, <span style="">1955</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the order of <st1:date year="1955" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1955</st1:date> is very clear that it
"shall not constitute a precedent with respect to the disposition of all
dividends whether already declared or to be herein­after declared."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of waiver, therefore, fails.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, appellant would insist that upon the death of Mr. Harden
in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> on <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="5">May <span style="">1,
 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>or
during the <span class="SpellE">pen­dency</span> of the proceedings, Recto's
claim should have been forthwith <span style="">dismissed </span>and filed in the administration pro­ceedings
of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Harden's</span> estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But appellant erroneous­ly assumes that
Recto's claim is a "money claim" under the Rules<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
when it is neither a claim nor a judgment for money <u><span style="">directed against the decedent, Mr. Harden</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Recto's
claim is founded on a personal obligation of Mrs. Harden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But granting that Recto's claim is a money

that a charging lien established on the property in litigation to secure
