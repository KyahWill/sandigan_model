the complex crimes of murder with assault upon an agent of a person in
authority, with Pfc. Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> as victim, and of
frustrated murder with assault upon an agent of a person in authority, with

to indemnify jointly and severally, the offended party in the sum of P5,000.00,

Patricio Fernandez, Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span> and Adolfo (Rodolfo)
<span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>, in separate petitions signed by them,
manifested and prayed that their appeals be considered withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court granted the petitions and dismissed
their appeals, fully persuaded from a careful consideration of the evidence on
record that their participation in the commission of the crimes charged has
been established beyond reason­able doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In consequence, this opinion will deal only with the appeal of the
remaining five appellants, namely, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Bautista,
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span>, <span class="SpellE">Drillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Caiwan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
was the supreme leader of a religious organization known as the FILIPINASNON
KABUS MAGU-UMA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next in command and
general mission­ary was <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ten accused and the other persons

<p class="BODY">For about two weeks <span class="GramE">Immediately</span> prior to
<st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, Bautista, <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>
(Adolfo), <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span> (Vidal), <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Labas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gacatura</span> stayed
in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Matag-ub</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the morning of said date, during a meeting
of the members of the aforementioned organization convoked by <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>, which was attended by all the accused, and by <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span> (Vidal), <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lasbas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gacatura</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span> (<span class="SpellE">Cosme</span>), <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span> (<span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>), <span class="SpellE">Mablang</span> (Santiago), <span class="SpellE">Aleniabo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ava­rial</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arizo</span>; those in
attendance were exhorted by <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and Bautista to
challenge the PC soldiers when they meet the latter, telling them that the sol­diers
were hired by the priest to kill <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> for
P70,000.00. Most of those present were armed with bolos and canes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> told his
followers that the signal to attack the soldiers is the raising of his cane to
his right shoulder. Following the ad­journment of the meeting after Lunch, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and his followers left for barrio <span class="SpellE">Sombalawan</span> where they had been invited.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Pfc. Remy <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
and Pfc. Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>, having been informed that <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and his followers were in barrio Santo Rosario in
the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Matag-ub</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
went to that place in obedience to the order of the provincial commander of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> to apprehend <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>,
Bautista and Maria <span class="SpellE">Lagbas</span>, who were accused of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in a criminal case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sol­diers enlisted the aid of two civilians, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carlobos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paña</span>, to serve the warrant of ar­rest. Remy <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> was in civilian clothes, while Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> had his PC uniform on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon meeting <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
and his group, <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>
identi­fied themselves as PC soldiers. When <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
showed <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> a copy of the warrant and informed
him that he was under arrest, the latter refused to be arrested and challenged
the soldiers to file char­ges against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of the obstinate refusal of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
to be placed under arrest, and finding that they were greatly outnumbered by
the followers of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, who were armed with bolos,
daggers and canes, <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>
decided not to press the arrest, and prepared to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
placed his cane on his right shoulder, and immediately his followers surrounded
the soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> were hacked with bolos and hit with canes
by Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span>, Patricia Fernandez, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Bautista, <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Caiwan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Drillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span>,
Luis <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span>, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span>
and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carlobos</span> shouted at the assailants
to stop, and they dispersed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gave <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> a chance to crawl to a nearby <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>
where he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pa­rambita</span>
crawled to a nearby bamboo grove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carlobos</span> looked far <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
and, finding him at the bamboo grove still alive, took him to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Downes</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> was
already dead, <span class="SpellE">Carlobos</span> left him on the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
the body of <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> was ta­ken to the municipal
building by police sergeant Caber and the barrio lieutenant of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being informed of the incident, PC provincial commander <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> H. <span class="SpellE">Ortilloza</span> immediately
went to barrio Santo Rosario.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> dead and <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
seriously wounded, he organized a task force to apprehend the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arrested were the ten accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of them executed a writ­ten confession
narrating his participation in the commission of the crimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The injuries sustained by Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>
were:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stab wound, back, <span class="SpellE">thorasic</span>,
penetrating cutting the ribs 2" x 1/2" about one inch posterior to
mid-<span class="SpellE">axiliary</span> line;</blockquote>

</span>Cause or death due to <u>shock</u>, secondary to severe hemorrhage

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Remy <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
suffered the following injuries which, barring <span class="GramE">complications,</span>
would require a healing period of from 60 to 120 days:</p>

<blockquote>“1. Wound, stab, <span class="SpellE">superorbital</span>, cutting
frontal bone, right;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing incidents are shown by the evidence of the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the appellants tried to show by their
testimonies that <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and his followers were on
their way to <span class="SpellE">Sombalawan</span> when they were met by Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>, Remy <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Carlobos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paña</span>. <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> asked if the
group of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> belonged to the organization <span class="SpellE">Filipinasnon</span> <span class="SpellE">Kabus</span> <span class="SpellE">Magu-uma</span>, and he received an affirmative answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked for their identification cards and
they were exhibited to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He inquired
who in the group were <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lagbas</span>
and Bautista and, the persons concerned having introduced themselves, <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> told them:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"You are under arrest."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three asked with what case they were charged, and <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> informed them that they were accused of <span class="SpellE">es­tafa</span> in <span class="SpellE">Jiabong</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> refused to go with the soldiers, in spite of an
invitation to that effect, because <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> could
not show the original of the warrant of Arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon <span class="SpellE">Opinano's</span> refusal, <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
remarked that they should be prepared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forthwith, the soldiers fired successive shots at the group of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> which was but four meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span> was hit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the commotion that ensued, some scampered away and hid behind coconut
trees and banana plants, and others lied down on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the firing, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Avarial</span>, Santiago <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>
and Luis <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span> grappled with the soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> was
hacked by <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aliñabo</span> on
the forehead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avarial</span>
hit the hand of <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>, and after the revolver which
the latter was holding had fallen to the ground, Fernandez <span class="GramE">took,</span>
the gun and ran away. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> was also stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Aliñabo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the incident, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and his
followers proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Kangkalaw</span> and staved in the
house of Pa­tricio Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
morning, on their way to <span class="SpellE">Villaba</span>, they sew PC soldiers
manhandling the people, so they went to <span class="SpellE">Mataroto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused were apprehend­ed at <span class="SpellE">Montealegre</span> and brought to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Kananga</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They claim that their extrajudicial confessions were exe­cuted by them
because of maltreatment which they suf­fered in the hands of PC officers and
soldiers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants have assigned three errors, allegedly committed by the
trial court:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

on <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1960</st1:date>, to plan
the murder of Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> and Remy <span class="SpellE">Rarambita</span>;</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->"<span class="GramE">in</span> finding that
even without the extra­judicial confession of the accused, the evidence
presented supported its findings that the accused were responsible for the
death of <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> and the wounding of <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful review of the record, <span class="GramE">We</span>
have become fully persuaded that the lower court did not com­mit the errors
imputed to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence discloses that the <span class="SpellE">Filipinasnon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kabus</span> <span class="SpellE">Magu-uma</span> is a
religious organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, founded
in the year 1954, by <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Bautista. Upon joining
the organization, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
became its supreme leader. The utter lack of education on the part of the members
of the organization is described by <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> in these
words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"these poor people
approached me x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and I
found out that they have no education, and they do not know how to read and
write x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that is why for
the sake of helping these people who wanted to find progress and knowledge x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> they needed me."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the sojourn of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>,
his followers visited him "to pay their respects" and "pledge
their loyalty", and to thank him also for all the good things he had done
for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moral and spiritual
influence of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> on his followers was so strong
that, in the words of defense witness <span class="SpellE">Bier­venido</span>
Garcia, his teachings were accepted as the words of God.</p>

<p class="BODY">The organization was able to secure from the Assistant Insurance
Commissioner a certification that it has complied with the legal requirements
of benevolent societies or associations, and it was granted a license to
transact: business concerning mutual benefits and relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this license, its members had embarked
in an indiscriminate and unbridled solicitation of contributions to further its
cause, culminat­ing in the filing of a criminal complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lagbas</span> and Bautista with the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Jiabong</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The warrant of arrest, which was certified by
the Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, for
service by any authority out side the province, was brought to the 59th PC
Company at Camp <span class="SpellE">Downes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was entrusted to Pfc. Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> and Pfc. Remy <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> for
enforcement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case was not unknown to <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, for even before March, 1960, he already knew of
its <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his extrajudicial confession, Exhibit L,
he declared thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
before March 25, 1960, I already knew I was accused of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
before the justice of the peace court of <span class="SpellE">Jiabong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>; the reason I went to <span class="SpellE">Matag-ub</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, was to avoid arrest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> also knew that there was a
price on his head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he declared at
the trial:</p>

<blockquote>"A.- x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> There was even a person in the name of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> Lim who offered P72,000,00 reward<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for my death and also of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Gabumpa</span>." <span class="GramE">(p. 248, <span class="SpellE">t.s</span>. n., Nov. 14, 1960.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The sojourn in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span> of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and some of
the members of the organization has been duly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosa <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>, wife
of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span>, declared
that for about two weeks immediately prior to <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="3">March 25 1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Bautista,

<p class="BODY">We are inclined to believe that the extrajudicial confessions of
the appellants were executed freely and voluntarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contained such details as only the <span class="SpellE">declarants</span> could have furnished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, in the confession of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Bautista, the particulars about the constitution
and by-laws of the organization and of the various branches <span class="GramE">thereof,</span>

that the investigating officers fabricated said particulars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as typified by the confession of <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, the
extrajudicial statements of the appellants contained <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
as well as exculpatory facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and
Bautista concerning the alleged maltreatment are hopelessly
irreconcilable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bautista testified that
Capt. <span class="SpellE">Dimaala</span> and Major <span class="SpellE">Hortillosa</span>
maltreated them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> declared that during the investigation, Major <span class="SpellE">Hortillosa</span> was very friendly with him and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Dimaala</span> did not maltreat him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Drillo</span> <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span>, on his part, declared that the prisoners, in his
cell were the ones who mal­treated him, and he did not report any maltreatment
to the presiding judge when the latter paid him a visit at the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> sub-provincial jail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor did he submit himself to any government physician for
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span>
tried to convey that he was urged by the PC soldiers to impute the assault of <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> to <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His confession, however, does not contain such a statement nor was a
question to that effect ever asked of him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Caiwan</span>
admitted that he did not report any maltreatment to any government authority or
even to his lawyer, and that the first time he mentioned maltreatment was when
he testified in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the posture
of appellants' testimonies, there is strong reason to believe that the claim of
alleged maltreatment is a pretext and a last-ditch attempt to exculpation of
the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither does the <span class="SpellE">appelant</span>' version of
the incident inspire rational belief. <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Bautista tried to make the impression that they were fired upon by the victims
when <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> refused to be arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, however, the close proximity of
the soldiers to <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and his followers - a
distance of four meters - it is strange that the group of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
emerged unscathed from the encounter whereas the PC soldiers sustained mortal
injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed that <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span> was hit on the head by a bullet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, however, discredited by the trial
court thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The contention of the accused that <span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>
<span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>
fired eight (8) shots at the group of the accused at a distance of only four(4)
meters, with 45 caliber pistol and revolver, without said sol­diers hitting
anyone of the accused, except on the head of <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span> causing a
slight injury, before the three companions of the accused assaulted said
soldiers, runs counter to the ordinary course of nature, unless we give credit
to their improbable claim and fanatical belief that the said accused are
invulnerable to bullets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No witness
other than the accused has been pre­sented to show and testify to this fact;
and no medical certificate has ever been presented to show that <span class="SpellE">Tran­quilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span> was
injured; and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span>
himself has never been presented. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We fully agree, with the foregoing findings and conclusions of
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conspicuously noticeable from the evidence that while the
appellants are in unison in their testi­mony that the soldiers fired successive
shots towards the group of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> at a distance of
only four (4) meters, their accounts of the event are contradictory of each
other which renders their version incredible. Thus, appellant <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Caiwan</span> did not mention
in his testimony anything about the wounding of <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> When
your group proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Sombalawan</span>, can you tell the
court what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span> When
we went ahead with <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, we heard shots behind
us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> What
did you do when you heard the firing of shots?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span> We
ran away and some were lying on the ground.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> When
there were no more shots, what did you and your companions do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span class="GramE">.-</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We proceeded our way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Where
did you go? </blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span> To
barrio <span class="SpellE">Sombalawan</span> with <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>,
Bautista <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span>, Rodolfo and Vidal <span class="SpellE">Melendres</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gacatura</span> Luis and
Leonardo <span class="SpellE">CabaIican</span>, <span class="SpellE">Drillo</span>
and Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Panoy</span>, and I do not remember the
rest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Luis <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span>, accused-appellant, who
was also in the group of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>, declared thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> then I saw they (soldiers) were conversing with <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>; after a while <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
left the group of <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span>, and when we were about
to proceed on our way, I heard eight(8) shots; when I stood up, I saw three
persons grappling with each other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Do
you know the names of those persons grappling with each other?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span> Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span class="GramE">.-</span> Please
tell the <st1:street><st1:address>Hon. Court</st1:address></st1:street> their
names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.-</span> <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Avarial</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
<span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aleniabo</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The witness said nothing about <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span> having been hit on the head with a bullet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The soldiers did not have the opportunity to
fire their guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Drillo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panoy</span> declared:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"when I looked around, I saw <span class="SpellE">Avarial</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mabuang</span> and Luis <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span>
grappling with Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>; <span class="SpellE">Avarial</span>
hit with a bolo the hand of <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span> and the revolver
fell to the ground."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be
noted that the witness pointed to Luis <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span> as
one of the three who was grappling with Luis <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>,
and yet, <span class="SpellE">Cabalican</span> disclaimed having struggled with <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>, and tried to make the court believed that he did not
do anything to assault the soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse still, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> made no mention
whatsoever about the wounding of <span class="SpellE">Tabudlong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and Bautista had every motive
to exhort their followers to attack the PC soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were accused of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a price on the head of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing
that the members of the or­ganization accepted the Words of <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span>
as gospel truth, the two leaders induced their followers to be­lieve that they
are invulnerable to bullets, and that a shipload of arms and ammunitions were
available to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Painting before them
the picture of persecuted men, <span class="SpellE">Opiniano</span> and Bautista
prodded their followers by inflammatory remarks to defy the lawful
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They preyed on the utter
lack of education and gullibility of the members of the organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they succeeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting as one, the ten accused and some
others, members of the organization, all assaulted <span class="SpellE">Meroy</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Parambita</span> with bolos, daggers and canes,
culminating in death to one and mortal injuries to the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence <span class="GramE">have</span>
clearly shown that they had acted with concert and in unison in obedience to a
plan or prior understanding to commit a punishable wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crimes charged have been committed, as
disclosed by the evidence, beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
