				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The &nbsp;above-entitled cases &nbsp;originated from a complaint for &nbsp;unfair labor practice against the &nbsp;Victorias Milling Company, Inc., filed by the acting prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations on March 2, 1960. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing of the charges the parties &nbsp; entered into &nbsp;a stipulation of facts, the most important provisions of which &nbsp;are &nbsp;as follows: &nbsp;On April 6, 1957 the Victorias &nbsp;Milling Company, Inc. and the Free Visayan Workers entered into a &nbsp;collective bargaining agreement &nbsp;which &nbsp;was to expire on December 31, &nbsp;1959. &nbsp;The agreement contains an automatic renewal clause &nbsp;after &nbsp;December &nbsp; 31, &nbsp;1959. &nbsp;The &nbsp;duration &nbsp;of the agreement and the automatic renewal clause are contained in the following paragraphs of the agreement: <blockquote> <p>"DURATION OF &nbsp;AGREEMENT"</p> <p>"This &nbsp;agreement &nbsp;shall &nbsp;remain in &nbsp;full force and &nbsp;effect until midnight of December 31, &nbsp;1959, continuing from year to year from the date &nbsp;of the signing hereof, unless either party gives written notice by registered mail no more &nbsp;than seventy-five (75) &nbsp;days nor less than &nbsp;thirty &nbsp;(30) days &nbsp;prior &nbsp;to December &nbsp;31, 1959, or each subsequent renewal &nbsp;anniversary date thereafter, to the effect &nbsp;that said party shall modify or &nbsp;terminate the entire agreement, in which event &nbsp;this agreement &nbsp;shall be considered terminated or &nbsp;open for negotiation.</p> <p>"If &nbsp;the notice &nbsp;sent in &nbsp;accordance which &nbsp;the above paragraph affects a &nbsp;portion or &nbsp;portions of &nbsp;the &nbsp;agreement, the portion &nbsp; or portions not affected shall remain in force during &nbsp;the renewal period. "Twenty (20) days &nbsp;after receipt of the notice of modification &nbsp;or termination, the parties shall meet for the purpose of bargaining with respect to the provisions of &nbsp;this &nbsp;agreement or parts &nbsp;thereof which have been terminated &nbsp;by either &nbsp;party."</p> </blockquote> <p>Sometime in October, &nbsp;1957, a petition &nbsp;for &nbsp;certification of elections &nbsp;in &nbsp;the Victorias &nbsp;Milling &nbsp;Company, &nbsp;Inc. was filed &nbsp;by Victorina &nbsp;A. Combate and &nbsp;318 &nbsp;others. &nbsp;In this case &nbsp;before &nbsp;the Industrial Court in May, 1959, the Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU) intervened. &nbsp;&nbsp;And on August 12, 1960, the Court of &nbsp;Industrial Relations in the case for certification of elections ordered the &nbsp; holding &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;certification &nbsp;of election. &nbsp;It does &nbsp;not appear from the record that the election has already been made. &nbsp;&nbsp;Neither does &nbsp;the result thereof appear.</p> <p>On October 26, 1959 Vicente Convito, &nbsp;President of the Victorias-Manapla Workers Organization (PAPLU) &nbsp;wrote a communication &nbsp;to the respondent Victorias Milling Company, Inc., requesting that the company desist from entering into a new agreement with any union until the question of representation has been determined by the &nbsp;court; that the majority of the workers &nbsp;of the Victorias Milling Company, Inc. have joined the &nbsp;said organization (PAFLU). Again &nbsp;on October 29, &nbsp;1959, Vicente Convito representing the &nbsp;same Philippine Association &nbsp;of Free &nbsp; Labor &nbsp;Unions wrote &nbsp;a letter to the &nbsp;respondent company alleging that in view of the affiliation of the workers and laborers with the Free Visayas Workers and in view of the fact that the latter's &nbsp;agreement with &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;company is bound &nbsp;to expire, certain &nbsp;proposals be taken up &nbsp;for &nbsp;the purpose of collective bargaining. &nbsp;In answer to the above two communications sent by the President of the PAFLU the respondent company wrote the representative of &nbsp;the PAFLU as &nbsp;follows: &nbsp;That m view &nbsp;of the fact that &nbsp; the petition for the certification &nbsp;of elections &nbsp;is still pending and the issue of the majority representation has not been resolved yet, the respondent company could not take action on &nbsp;the request for collective &nbsp;bargaining presented by the PAFLU.</p> <p>The complaint for &nbsp;unfair &nbsp;labor &nbsp;practice arose from the dismissal &nbsp;of 10 employees, &nbsp;namely, Felino &nbsp;Dalipe, Donato Anazarias, &nbsp;Prudencio Parcon, Celestino Bernila, Remegio Seballos, Belarmino &nbsp;Bartico, &nbsp;Agustin &nbsp;Dulano, Ignacio Lozano, Loreto Undar, and William Cevero. These employees were on or before &nbsp;December 31, 1959 members of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Free Farmers Union or &nbsp;the Federation of Free Workers.</p> <p>On January &nbsp;11, 1960, a supplemental agreement having been entered into by the Victorias Milling Company, &nbsp;Inc. and the Free Visayan Workers &nbsp;providing for wage increases, the above-named ten dismissed employees had received increases in their pay. &nbsp;But on February 10, 1960, they &nbsp;resigned &nbsp;or separated &nbsp;from the Free &nbsp;Farmers or Workers Union and &nbsp;joined the &nbsp;Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU). &nbsp;&nbsp;In view &nbsp;of this change in their &nbsp;affiliation from the &nbsp;Free Farmers Union to the &nbsp;Philippine Association &nbsp;of Free Labor Unions &nbsp;(PAFLU), which change became known to the respondent company, an investigation of their membership and change in membership was made.</p> <p>The Free Visayan Workers Union conducted an investigation of the 10 dismissed employees prior to their expulsion from the respondent union and its &nbsp;recommendation &nbsp;was for &nbsp;their &nbsp; dismissal. &nbsp;In &nbsp;this investigation &nbsp;it was &nbsp;found out &nbsp;that they received the wage increases on January 14, 1960, but &nbsp;changed &nbsp;their &nbsp;affiliation on February 10, 1960, from the Free Visayan Workers Union to the Philippine Association &nbsp;of &nbsp;Free &nbsp;Labor &nbsp;Unions (PAPFLU). Consequently, with this finding of &nbsp;the change in their membership and in &nbsp;view of the &nbsp;following portion of the existing agreement between the Free Farmers Union &nbsp;and the respondent Company:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Section 5(a). &nbsp;All employees who are covered by this agreement as provided for in Section 4 hereof, who, at the date of the signing of the agreement, are &nbsp;member of the union, shall remain members in good &nbsp;standing as a condition &nbsp;of continued employment. &nbsp;Those covered employees who, at the date of the signing of this agreement, are &nbsp;not members of &nbsp; the &nbsp;Union, shall &nbsp;be required to join &nbsp;and remain &nbsp;members of the Union in good standing as a condition of continued employment. * * &nbsp;*</p> <p>"Any laborer or employee who shall join the union in pursuance of the above requirement and who thereafter shall &nbsp;resign from the union or is expelled therefrom for any act contrary to the by-laws, rules and &nbsp;regulation of the Union, shall &nbsp;upon &nbsp;the advise &nbsp;of the Union to the &nbsp;management of the company be dismissed from his employment. &nbsp;It is &nbsp;to be understood, however, &nbsp;that the &nbsp;company reserves its right &nbsp;to look into the merits of &nbsp;the expulsion of the laborer or employee concerned, where his &nbsp;dismissal from the Company is &nbsp;sought by the Union. * &nbsp;* *"</p> </blockquote> <p> which agreement is a closed-shop agreement, the respondent &nbsp;company, upon advice of the &nbsp;Free Farmers &nbsp;Union, dismissed &nbsp;the above-mentioned 10 employees. &nbsp;&nbsp;Their dismissal &nbsp;is &nbsp;the subject of the &nbsp;complaint for unfair labor practice filed by the prosecutor of &nbsp;the Court &nbsp;of &nbsp;Industrial Relations in these two cases now before the Court. The &nbsp;facts found by &nbsp;the hearing &nbsp;officer regarding the previous &nbsp;affiliation &nbsp;of the above-mentioned &nbsp;ten dismissed employees are &nbsp;as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"With &nbsp;respect &nbsp;to the individual complainants, &nbsp;except &nbsp;Santiago Palomo &nbsp;and Pedro &nbsp;Moran, the charges in regard &nbsp;to &nbsp; said persons having been withdrawn (t.s.n. pp. 68-69), all were &nbsp;former members of the respondent union. &nbsp;On February 11, 1960, they severed their affiliation with &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;union &nbsp;(Exhibits &nbsp;"A" to "M-9"). &nbsp;Immediately thereafter &nbsp;the &nbsp; investigating committee of the Victorias Milling Company Unit &nbsp;of the respondent union started an &nbsp;investigation and its &nbsp;finding forwarded &nbsp;to &nbsp;the Central &nbsp;Board &nbsp; of &nbsp;said respondent union. &nbsp;(Exhibit "F"). &nbsp;The latter accepted the resignation &nbsp; of the complainants &nbsp;and recommended their dismissal. (Exhibit &nbsp;"G"). &nbsp;The respondent company in &nbsp;similarly &nbsp;worded &nbsp;letters dismissed the said complainants based on the &nbsp;union &nbsp;security &nbsp;provisions of the Collective Bargaining agreement in question (Exhibits "B" &nbsp;to "B"-9"), after proper &nbsp;investigation (Stipulation &nbsp;No. 9).</p> <p>"It must be noted &nbsp;that the circumstances &nbsp;mentioned in the &nbsp;preceding paragraph occurred after the execution of the supplementary agreement and &nbsp; after the period for &nbsp;the &nbsp;modification &nbsp;and/or &nbsp;termination &nbsp;of the agreement has expired.</p> <p>"It is &nbsp;also a &nbsp;fact that &nbsp;the herein complainants before &nbsp;their dismissal were members of the &nbsp;respondent &nbsp;union."</p> </blockquote> <p> The &nbsp;hearing &nbsp;officer in arriving at its &nbsp;recommendation to &nbsp;the &nbsp;court &nbsp;reasoned as &nbsp;follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The reasons for those express prohibitions are apparent. &nbsp;&nbsp;Should the closed shop &nbsp;provisions for a collective bargaining agreement be given &nbsp;absolute &nbsp;effect, it &nbsp;will maintain any labor organization in perpetuity despite the manifest wishes of the employees &nbsp;concerned which is contrary &nbsp;to the letter and &nbsp;spirit of Republic Act No. 875. &nbsp;Just as our very own system of life &nbsp;guarantees &nbsp;a periodical &nbsp;gauge to determine &nbsp;the &nbsp;people's free &nbsp;wishes in those &nbsp;they have &nbsp;elected to &nbsp;govern &nbsp;them through a system &nbsp;of political&nbsp; election, so must the bargaining representative cf &nbsp;the employees &nbsp;be equally determined at an appropriate &nbsp;time and &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court of Industrial Relations by &nbsp;law &nbsp;is &nbsp;the agency charged &nbsp;with &nbsp;such function, and the exercise of such choice should likewise be free from discrimination.</p> <p>"While this Court &nbsp;is &nbsp;fully &nbsp;aware &nbsp;of &nbsp;the possible &nbsp;levelings of the &nbsp;accusation &nbsp;that &nbsp;we &nbsp;must &nbsp;not &nbsp;interfere with &nbsp;the closed &nbsp;shop provisions of any validity &nbsp;entered bargaining &nbsp;as the &nbsp;same might constitute &nbsp;internal &nbsp;union &nbsp; matters, &nbsp;yet such &nbsp;matters, &nbsp;do &nbsp;constitute relations going &nbsp;deeply into &nbsp;the &nbsp;roots of the &nbsp;right to self-organization which this &nbsp;Court is duty bound by law to protect and uphold."</p> </blockquote> <p>We do not agree with the court below &nbsp;in its ruling &nbsp;that the &nbsp;recognition &nbsp;and enforcement &nbsp;cf &nbsp;the closed-shop agreement between the Free Farmers Union &nbsp;and &nbsp;the Victorias</p> <p>Milling Company, Inc. would tend to perpetuate the labor organization which secured it. &nbsp;This claim cannot be true because the closed-shop agreement is to be enforced after December 31, 1959, automatically until such time as a new bargaining agreement can be entered into.</p> <p>The ruling of the court below suspending the operation of the &nbsp;agreement automatically renewed, &nbsp;would produce as a result a period of interregnum in which no agreement would govern at all. &nbsp;There would be a void if we do not authorize enforcement of &nbsp;the &nbsp;automatic renewal clause adopted &nbsp;in the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Such a situation where no agreement is in &nbsp;force to govern the relations &nbsp;between laborers &nbsp;and capitalists is unwise, &nbsp;as it would give either party an opportunity &nbsp;to commit a breach of the law.</p> <p>Another reason for &nbsp;enforcing &nbsp;the &nbsp;closed-shop agreement is the principle of sanctity or inviolability of contracts guaranteed by the Constitution. &nbsp;As &nbsp;a matter of principle the provision of the Industrial Peace Act granting freedom to employees &nbsp;to organize themselves and &nbsp;select their representative &nbsp;for &nbsp;entering &nbsp;into bargaining &nbsp; agreements, should be subordinated to the constitutional provision protecting &nbsp;the &nbsp;sanctity &nbsp;of contracts. &nbsp;&nbsp;We can not &nbsp;conceive how freedom to contract, which should be allowed to be exercised &nbsp;without &nbsp;limitation may be subordinated to the freedom of laborers to choose the organization &nbsp;they desire to represent them. &nbsp;And even &nbsp;if &nbsp;the legislature had intended to do &nbsp;so and made such &nbsp;freedom of the laborer paramount to the &nbsp;sanctity of obligation of contracts, such attempt &nbsp;to &nbsp;override &nbsp;the &nbsp; constitutional provision would necessarily <i>ipso facto</i> be null and void.</p> <p>A case &nbsp;brought &nbsp;on &nbsp;a writ of &nbsp;certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States presented the same problem that we now have before us, namely, the effectivity of a closed-shop agreement as against the freedom of the &nbsp;laborers or employees to choose the labor organization they &nbsp;want to affiliate &nbsp;with. &nbsp;&nbsp;There it was &nbsp;said &nbsp;that the Act granting the employer and employees the privilege to enter into &nbsp;a closed-shop &nbsp;agreement, &nbsp;also recognized &nbsp;the &nbsp;right of &nbsp;the workers to choose their union, but that said right to choose a labor union &nbsp;is limited &nbsp;by the proviso authorizing parties to enter into a closed-shop &nbsp;agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hereinbelow is &nbsp;a summary of the facts involved in said case and the reasons adduced by &nbsp;the court in arriving at &nbsp;its &nbsp;conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>Petitioner was engaged in producing glycerin for war purposes. Its employees were at &nbsp;first represented &nbsp;by a &nbsp;union affiliated with the &nbsp;American &nbsp;Federation &nbsp;of &nbsp;Labor. &nbsp;In &nbsp;193S the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, became the representative of petitioner's employees. &nbsp;On July 9, 1941, the &nbsp;C. I. O. entered &nbsp;into a collective bargaining &nbsp;contract &nbsp;with &nbsp;petitioner which &nbsp;contained a closed-shop &nbsp;provision to the &nbsp;effect that new employees shall be hired through the &nbsp;offices of the &nbsp;Union, &nbsp;provided the &nbsp;latter shall be able to furnish competent workers for &nbsp;the work required; &nbsp;otherwise, the employer may &nbsp;hire from &nbsp;outside &nbsp;sources, provided &nbsp;that employees so &nbsp;hired shall make &nbsp; application &nbsp;for membership &nbsp;in the Union within 15 &nbsp;days of their employment; and that the &nbsp;employees covered &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;agreement &nbsp;shall be &nbsp;members in &nbsp;good standing of the Union. &nbsp;This contract was entered in good &nbsp;faith by the parties and was of indefinite &nbsp;duration.</p> <p>On &nbsp;July &nbsp;24, &nbsp;&nbsp;1945, &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;C.I.O. and &nbsp;petitioner &nbsp;entered &nbsp;into &nbsp;a supplemental agreement &nbsp; that their contract of &nbsp;July 9, 1941, &nbsp;"shall remain &nbsp;in &nbsp;full &nbsp;force &nbsp; and &nbsp;effect" &nbsp;pending &nbsp;approval of certain agreed-upon &nbsp;items, other than &nbsp; the &nbsp;closed-shop provision, &nbsp;by the War &nbsp;Labor &nbsp;Board. &nbsp;Shortly after the &nbsp;making &nbsp;of the supplemental agreement, open agitation for a change of bargaining representative began at a period during which the National Labor Relation believed was appropriate &nbsp;to seek a &nbsp;redetermination of &nbsp;representatives. &nbsp;On July &nbsp;31 &nbsp;an &nbsp;unauthorized strike occurred &nbsp;which &nbsp;lasted two and &nbsp;one half &nbsp;days, although the &nbsp;C.I.O. had pledged &nbsp;its membership &nbsp;not to &nbsp;strike during &nbsp; wartime. &nbsp;&nbsp;A group of employees formed an independent &nbsp;organization which &nbsp;later sought to affiliate with the American Federation &nbsp;&nbsp;of Labor. &nbsp;Because they were &nbsp; unmindful &nbsp;of the warnings issued &nbsp;by the C. I. &nbsp;O. that disciplinary action against members would be taken for rival union activity, some 37 &nbsp;employees were suspended &nbsp;&nbsp; and expelled by &nbsp;the C. &nbsp;I. &nbsp;O. and discharged by petitioner upon demand by the C.I.O. on the ground that they were no longer "members in good standing" of &nbsp;the C.I.O. as required by the closed-shop contract.</p> <p>Petitioner was charged with violation of Sec. 8(1) &nbsp;and Sec. 8(3) of the National &nbsp;Labor &nbsp;Relations Act &nbsp;and &nbsp;found by the &nbsp;National Labor &nbsp;Relations Board guilty thereof and ordered &nbsp;to reinstate the discharged employees. &nbsp;The Court &nbsp;of Appeals &nbsp;having entered &nbsp;a decree enforcing the Board's order, a petition for a writ of certiorari against the judgment of said court was brought before the Supreme Court &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;United &nbsp;States.</p> <p>Sec. 8(3) &nbsp;referred &nbsp;to above considers &nbsp;as unfair &nbsp;labor &nbsp;practice for &nbsp;an employer &nbsp;to discriminate in &nbsp;regard to &nbsp;hire or tenure of employment or &nbsp;any term or condition of &nbsp;employment to encourage or discourage membership &nbsp;in any labor organization, but &nbsp;does not preclude &nbsp;an &nbsp;employer &nbsp;from &nbsp;&nbsp;making &nbsp;an &nbsp;agreement &nbsp;&nbsp;with &nbsp;labor organization &nbsp;to &nbsp;require as a condition &nbsp;of employment membership therein, if such labor organization &nbsp;is &nbsp;the representative &nbsp;of the employees.</p> <p>Recognizing &nbsp;that the &nbsp;discharges had &nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;effect &nbsp; of interfering with the &nbsp;employees' right &nbsp;given &nbsp;by Sec. &nbsp;7 of the National &nbsp;Labor Relations &nbsp;Act &nbsp;to self-organization and &nbsp;&nbsp;to &nbsp;collective bargaining through &nbsp;representatives of their own choosing, and that &nbsp;the discharges had &nbsp;the effect of discriminating, contrary to the prohibition of &nbsp;Sec. 8(3) &nbsp;of said Act, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Supreme &nbsp;Court &nbsp;nevertheless found that a closed-shop agreement &nbsp;was &nbsp;valid &nbsp;under &nbsp;California law, and the California Supreme Court, &nbsp;in the case of&nbsp; James vs. Marinship (155 P2d &nbsp;32), explicity &nbsp;&nbsp;recognized &nbsp; that a union may &nbsp;expel persons who "have interests inimical to the union" because of the right of the union to reject Sr expel &nbsp;persons &nbsp;who refuse to &nbsp;abide by any reasonable &nbsp;regulation or lawful policy adopted by the &nbsp;union. Citing the case of Davis vs. &nbsp;International Alliance, 141 &nbsp;P2d 486, it stated &nbsp;that &nbsp;under &nbsp;California &nbsp;law, "an organization &nbsp;has the natural right of &nbsp;self-preservation, &nbsp;and may &nbsp;with propriety &nbsp;expel members who show their disloyalty &nbsp;by joining a rival organization." The contract was &nbsp;held to be valid &nbsp;under the &nbsp;Act &nbsp;and under state law.</p> <p>Upholding the &nbsp;validity of closed-shop &nbsp;agreements &nbsp;the &nbsp; Supreme Court &nbsp;further held that such &nbsp;agreements protect &nbsp;the &nbsp;integrity of the &nbsp;union &nbsp;and provides &nbsp;stability to &nbsp;labor relations, &nbsp;to achieve which was the primary &nbsp;objective of Congress &nbsp;in enacting &nbsp;the &nbsp;National Labor &nbsp; Relations Act. &nbsp;Congress knew that a closed-shop agreement would &nbsp;interfere with &nbsp; freedom &nbsp;of employees to organize in another union &nbsp;and would, &nbsp;if &nbsp;used, lead &nbsp;inevitably &nbsp;&nbsp;to discrimination &nbsp;in tenure of &nbsp;employment. &nbsp; Nevertheless, Congress inserted the proviso of &nbsp;See. 8(3) allowing &nbsp;closed &nbsp;shop contracts &nbsp;with &nbsp;full realization that it would &nbsp;be &nbsp;a limitation on &nbsp;Sec. 7 granting &nbsp;employees the the &nbsp;right to self-organization &nbsp;and &nbsp;collective bargaining. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. &nbsp;<i>vs.</i> Nat. Labor Relations Bd., et al., 388 U.S. 355, 365, 94 L ed. 161).</p> </blockquote> <p>The above U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared an employer which discharged employees expelled from the union because &nbsp;of activities for a rival union, &nbsp;from charges of unfair labor practice, &nbsp;where its action was based &nbsp;on a closed-shop contract with a bona fide labor union entered into and performed in good faith &nbsp;and valid &nbsp;in the &nbsp;state where made.</p> <p>Returning now to the case at bar, as we have found that &nbsp;the dismissal &nbsp;of the employees &nbsp;by the respondent Victorias &nbsp;Milling Company, Inc. was in pursuance of a clause of &nbsp;an agreement &nbsp;between said company and the Free &nbsp;Farmers Union, which agreement became &nbsp; automatically renewed upon its expiration &nbsp;on December 31, &nbsp;1959 and before a new bargaining agreement could &nbsp;be &nbsp;arrived at, the action of the respondent company in enforcing the terms of the closed-shop agreement is a valid exercise of its rights and obligations under the contract. &nbsp;The dismissal by virtue thereof cannot constitute an &nbsp;unfair &nbsp;labor practice, as it was &nbsp;in pursuance of an agreement that has been &nbsp;found to be regular and of a closed-shop &nbsp; agreement which under our laws is valid and binding.</p> <p>The decision &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;lower &nbsp;court declaring &nbsp;that the &nbsp;respondent company &nbsp;was guilty of unfair labor practice should, therefore, be set &nbsp;aside and the complaint for the said unfair labor practice dismissed.</p> <p>The Victorias-Manapla Organization &nbsp;(PAFLU) had also appealed from the decision of the court below for the reason that it did not grant them pay during the period of the dismissal &nbsp;of the laborers in &nbsp;question. &nbsp;In view &nbsp;of our ruling that the &nbsp;dismissal was valid, &nbsp;the appeal for &nbsp;back wages must also be denied. &nbsp;Without costs. &nbsp;So ordered.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C. &nbsp;J., &nbsp;Padilla, &nbsp;Bautista Angelo, &nbsp;Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, &nbsp; Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.,</i> concur.</p></div>
