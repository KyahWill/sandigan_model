Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> finding the defendants Miguel <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> guilty of the crime of robbery with double
homicide, sentencing them to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> with the accessory penalties provided for
by law and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the deceased
spouses Federico <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saturnina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Singong</span> de <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> in the
sum of P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to
pay the proportionate costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution discloses that on the early
evening of <st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1957</st1:date>,
accused Miguel <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>, together with their other identified
companions who are still at large, broke into the house of the spouses Federico
<span class="SpellE">Planas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saturnina</span> <span class="SpellE">Singong</span> de <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maybo</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Tacul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants were armed with bladed weapons - a
"<span class="SpellE">kabasi</span>" and a 'barong",
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The others were equally
armed with native bolos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Entering by way
of the main and kitchen stairs, the intruders immediately started hacking the
couple who were eating their supper at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Federico <span class="SpellE">Planas</span>
sustained, among others, "twelve (12) incised clean cut wounds at the
back"; his wife was found with "four (4) fatal big wounds at the back
almost a foot long and one foot deep which penetrated her intestines; one
shoulder punc­ture, 1 1/2 inches wide and 8 inches long." After allegedly
taking a trunk belonging to the victims (which was later found in the bushes
nearby), the malefactors returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">One <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> Mendoza dropped by the
spouses' house on the morning of <st1:date year="1957" day="3" month="1">January
 3, 1957</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a>
to fulfill an appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding the
couple already dead, he reported the matter to the barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Tacul</span>, who in turn informed Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maturan</span> of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maturan</span>, together
with three (3) of his policemen and one PC trooper, immediately proceeded to
the scene of the crime to make the proper investigation, arriving at <span class="SpellE">Tacul</span> on the morning of January 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bodies of the victims were already in the
early stages of decomposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently
they were killed while eating, as shown by the fact that there were still
unfinished portions of food on their plates when the policemen came.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information filed by the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> against appellants (the others had not been
apprehended) reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing of the information, another one of the
malefactors, <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> <span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an,
was apprehended but was not charged as co-defendant, and was instead utilized
by the prosecution as a state witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The identification of the herein appellants as mem­bers of the
group which perpetrated the crime is conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was furnished by <span class="SpellE">Punso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an, an eye-witness to the occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In substance his version is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that some five (5) days before January 3,
1957, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an and the other malefactors, met in <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> is house in the
presence of the latter's wife and daughter; that in that meeting <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> broached the plan to kill the couple because
according to him, he had not been able to get a certain parcel of land from
them; that the other co-accused gave their assent to the plan; that on the
night of January 3, 1957, under the pretext of going fishing, <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> prevailed <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> to join the group, which he reluctant did; that upon
reaching the <span class="SpellE">Blocon</span> river at a point nearest the
victims’ house, <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>
and their two other companions excused themselves by saying that they were
going to ask for some tobacco from <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> (Federico <span class="SpellE">Planas</span>), whose house was just nearby; that <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> <span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an stayed behind, but
had a clear full view of the house all the time; that he did not follow the
rest of the accused to the house because he was afraid that, they would really
carry out their earlier plan to kill the spouses; that he saw the accused
strike the victim almost simultaneously; and that when he saw <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> just the hacking
orgy, he left the place immediately.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ponso</span> <span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an,
it should be noted, is a son-in-law of appellant <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>, with whom he had had misunderstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the trial court, he would not
have testified as he did unless his testimony was the truth for no motive has
been shown for him to bear false witness against his own kin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quite revealing is the affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"C") exe­cuted by <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>,
wherein he denied having delivered any blow at all against the victims, but
pointed to Miguel <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> as among the active
participants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same affidavit he
traced the movements of his companions prior to, during and after the attack,
indicating that the <u>plan to kill the couple</u> was hatched a full five (5)
days in advance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
to the killing of <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>, was there any previous
meeting held planning how the killing will be made?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have not attended any meeting, sir, but I know that there was a
<u>plan to kill the couple</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who planned the killing and how did you know the plan?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was what happened sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five days before the killing of <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Calim</span> <span class="SpellE">Lasiya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Iranon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lasiya</span>, arrived at my house at <span class="SpellE">Tacul</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During their first two days, the two used to
go out every after breakfast and would return late in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the third day, just after supper, <span class="SpellE">Calim</span> started convincing me to accompany them to kill <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> and his wife but then I re­fused because <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> and myself do not have any misunderstanding and
besides I know him to be good to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fourth day, <span class="SpellE">Calim</span> repeated his request to me but I
also put down his plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the fifth
day, just after supper x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calim</span> again repeated his <u>proposal to bring me to
kill <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span></u> but still I refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time <span class="SpellE">Calim</span>
threatened me with death if I refuse because according to him, I might report
him later because I know his plan, telling me further, that they have already
agreed with Miguel <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> regarding the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because of his threats, I was forced to go
with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> (but) I was then afraid and besides it was really
against my will <u>to kill <span class="SpellE">Pedrin<span style="text-decoration: none;">g</span></span></u> because we are friends and he has
been very good to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"C-1")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>
now denies the veracity of his sworn statement and says that he affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> thereon without fully understanding its
contents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he was
prevailed upon to do so because he was afraid a Sgt. Reyes of the local PC
command, who had earlier maltreated him inside the PC barracks where he was
confined and who had even threatened him with mere harm should he fail to make
the statement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun's</span>
<span class="SpellE">pretention</span> deserves little con­sideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then acting mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>,
Claudio <span class="SpellE">Villariz</span>, positively affirmed that he himself
translated the contents of the questioned statement into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect in order that <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> would fully understand its meaning, if he
had been maltreated as he alleged, <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> would have complained to the acting mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This he did not do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, any maltreatment would have been
done to make him admit his participation in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet his affidavit is self-exculpatory in
nature, and throws the whole blame to his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course this particular circumstance
benefits him not at all, considering the other evidence against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Miguel <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> his
defense consists in a simple avowal of innocence, without any attempt to
discredit the evidence of his participation as given by <span class="SpellE">Ponso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
no ulterior motive is ascribed to <span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an for him to
implicate <span class="SpellE">Gamao</span> unjustly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that the testimony of one
witness, if credible and positive, if it satisfies the court beyond reasonable
doubt, is sufficient to convict (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Argana</span>,
L-19448, February 28, 1964).</p>

<p class="BODY">While appellants' guilt is established beyond doubt, we do not
agree that the crime is robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence concerning the robbery is too tenuous and
inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ponso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bila-an's</span> testimony on this point reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said you saw them hacking, who were hacking?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first one was <span class="SpellE">Kalim</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When my father-in-law hacked, <u>I ran away</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said that you ran, where did you proceed?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To where I live.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You mean to say in the house of <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span> and his companions go back to the house of <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> at any time after you saw the hacking of <span class="SpellE">Pedring</span> and his wife?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only persons whom I saw were my
father-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Kalim</span> and <span class="SpellE">Iranon</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did they have anything with them when they
came to the house of <span class="SpellE">Kinok</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>
(<u>after the killing</u>)?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What were those things?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Clothings</span>, <span class="SpellE">patadiong</span>, <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants, belt and
salmon.” (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., hearing of <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1959</st1:date>, pp. 12-13)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As may be noted, <span class="SpellE">Bila</span>-an did not see
the accused take anything from the victims’ house for the obvious reason that
he left immediately upon seeing his father-in-law striking them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the things al­legedly stolen
were not recovered and presented at the trial and that the contents of the
trunk found somewhere in the vicinity of the victims’ house were not
identified, there is no separate and sufficient proof of <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> to support a conviction for robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No robbery having been proved conviction
for robber with homicide impossible</u> (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manobo</span>,
L-19798, September 20, 1966)</p>

<blockquote>"A complaint charging the commission of the complex crime of
robbery with homicide must necessarily charge each of the component offenses
with the same precision that would be necessary if the were made the subject of
separate complaints. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is well recog­nized
in this jurisdiction that where a complex crime is charge and the evidence
fails to support the charge as to one of the component it offenses the
defendant can be convicted of the other." (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lahoylahoy</span>, 38 Phil. 330, 334)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The slaying of Federico <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> and his
wife <span class="SpellE">Saturnina</span> must be considered as double
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The confirmed facts show that
treachery attended the commission of the offense in that appellants, without
risk to themselves arising from any defense which the victims might put up,
suddenly and without warning attacked and hacked them from behind, as
eloquently attested by the numerous back wounds they sus­tained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, evident premeditation was also
present since appellants together with the other male factors, started to plot
the killing five (5) days before its actual commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">These aggravating circumstances - treachery and evident
premeditation - are alleged in the information, and either one suffices to
qualify the offense to murder (see People vs. <span class="SpellE">Jaravata</span>,
L-22029, <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1967</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no mitigating circumstance, the
remaining aggravating circumstance - even without appreciating the circumstance
that the killing had been perpetrated in the dwelling of the victims - would
justify the supreme penalty of death, but for lack of the necessary number of
votes among the members of the Court, only the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> is imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the sentence appealed from is modified by
finding appellants guilty of double murder (instead of robbery in band with
homicide) with the qualifying and aggravating circumstances aforesaid, and is
affirmed with respect to the penalty and the civil indemnity imposed, with
costs.</p>
