				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Declared guilty of unfair
labor practice and sentenced on August 18, 1965 by the Court of Industrial
Relations (CIR) <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> to restore respondent <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
Silva to his position as driver with back wages computed from March 5, 1959 to
the date of reinstatement (excluding the period from June 8, 1964 to March 8,
1965), petitioners seek review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A bus driver of
petitioner G. Liner since 1957, respondent </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Emiliano</span></span><span style=""> Silva joined the </span><span style="">"<span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> G. Liner." In January of 1959, he started campaign
for membership in the National Labor </span><span style="">Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A nucleus of the local
chapter </span>of that union <span style="">amongst
petitioner company's workers was eventually formed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Silva and 11 other drivers formally
affiliated with the National Labor Union on February 28, 1959.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When Silva reported for
work on March 5, 1959, </span>he was assigned Bus No. 19, an old and shabby
Chevrolet, <span style="">good for only 35 </span>seated
passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt discriminated
against.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He drove the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made three <span style="">trips, drove </span>the bus to the company garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left a written note with the dispatcher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That note was to the effect that <span style="">he would complain </span>with the Department
of Labor about an undue change in the condition of his employment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having lodged his complaint with the labor authorities, Silva
returned to his work late in the afternoon of that same day, <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was to Sign the dispatcher's book to
enable him to report for work the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispatcher for that day did not <span style="">allow him to sign up, on instructions from
the management.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He was told to see petitioner De Keyser, the com­pany
manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Silva saw De Keyser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter exhibited his displeasure for
Silva's having gone to the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>De Keyser's words were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Yoh</span>, Silva, are up to a lot of foolishness ('<span class="SpellE">marami</span> <span class="SpellE">kangkalokohan</span>').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You think we don't know what you have been
doing."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It developed that right
after Silva left for the Department of Labor on March 5, 1959, one Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Purita</span> de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, De Keyser's
assistant, instructed the conductor assigned to Silva's bus to accomplish a
written report merely mentioning that the bus went back to the garage at the
instance of the driver at 11:15 a.m., although the bus had no engine
trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no mention in the
explanation why the driver did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
report, to all indications, was conceived to justify violation report against
Silva.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Silva made attempts to
resume his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was given the run
around treatment by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
March 15, 1959, letters signed by the company investigator, Jose <span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span>, were sent to Silva and to three other drivers, <span class="SpellE">Brigido</span> <span class="SpellE">Daco</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Sabarillo</span> and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four were asked to return to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But only <span class="SpellE">Sabarillo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> were taken back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the fact that the four presented themselves in response to the call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attempts of Silva and respondent National
Labor Union to procure Silva's return proved futile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This precipitated the unfair labor practice com­plaint lodged
with the CIR by its acting prosecutor, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
Cruz, against petitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
With the result indicated at the start of this <span style="">opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioners ask this
Court to overturn the find­ings of fact heretofore related.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They question, the veracity of respondent
Silva's court testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They dissected
the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would want us to
conclude that the greater weight of evidence is in their favor.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A <span style="">principle to which this
Court has </span>consistently adhered by frequent pronouncements is that the
findings of fact of CIR will not be disturbed provided substantial evidence
exists in support thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In appeals from CIR decisions, preponderance of evidence is thus not the issue.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Since substantial evidence is before us, <span class="SpellE">CIR's</span>
findings of fact are conclusive upon this Court.</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioners next ask
us to overrule the CIR'S resolution for-the payment to Silva of full back
wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two cases they cited, <u><span style="">Fernando</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Angat</u></span> <u>Labor</u> <u>Union</u>,
L-17896, May 30, 1962, and <u>Sta</u>. <u>Cecilia</u> <u><span style="">Sawmills,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Inc</u>. <u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. <u>Court</u> </span><u>of</u> <u>Industrial</u>
<u>Relations</u>, L-19273 &amp; L-19273, February 29, 1964.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither <span style="">one nor the </span>other
may be equated with the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Fernando</u>,
the line was sold to Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employees were informed of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sought reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there held that, as reinstatement
depended upon the buyer, Fernando should, in equity, be held liable for back
wages only for a period of six months. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In <u>Sta</u>. <u>Cecilia</u> <u><span style="">Sawmills,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Inc</u>., the company's liability for back wages was for
three month's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, because <span style="">the company closed </span>operations due to
business losses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Itogon</span></u><span style="">-<u>Suyoc</u></span></span> <u>Mines</u>, <u>Inc</u>.
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Sañgilo</u>-<u>Itogon</u></span> <u>Workers'</u>
<u>Union</u>, L-24189, August 30, 1968, <span style="">we
believe, is here con­</span>trolling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, the dismissal of the employees was also because of unfair labor
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They remained dismissed<span style=""> for over ten years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there held, as we do now here, that the
employees are entitled to back wages, from the date of their dismissal to their
actual reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case just
cited, however, we established guidelines to be followed in the computation of
back wages, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“<u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be
deducted from the back wages accruing to each of the laborers to be reinstated
is the total amount of earnings obtained by him from other employment(s) from
the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the laborer decide that it is
preferable not to return to work, the deduction should be made up to the time
judgment becomes final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Second.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in
mitigation of the damages that the dismissed respondents are entitled to,
account should be taken <span style="">of </span>whether
in the exercise of due diligence respondents might have obtained income from
suitable remunerative employment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We see no reason to
depart from the <span class="SpellE"><u>Itogon</u></span> ruling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the observations
just noted, we vote to affirm the judgment under review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Costs against
petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
