				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">After filing on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="5">May 9,
 1961</st1:date> with the Office of the Solicitor General his declaration of
intention dated <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1961</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H, p. 8, rec.), Chua Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, filed
on June 5, 1962 his petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City
together with the joint affidavit of his three witnesses, namely, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, Pedro T. <span class="SpellE">Tisoy</span> (pp. 1-5,
rec.) as well as the <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copies of his
Immigrant Certificate of Residence issued on December 24, 1949, Alien
Certificate of Registration issued on January 6, 1951 and certificate of
arrival dated April 25, 1961 (pp. 6,7, 9, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of the petition as well as the date
of hearing of the same were accordingly posted on the bulletin board of the
clerk of court's office on <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="6">June 29,
 1962</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, p. 10, rec.) and published
in the Official Gazette and in the La <span class="SpellE">Prensa</span>, a
"news­paper of general circulation published in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>" once a week for three
consecutive weeks as required by law (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. E, E-1,
E-2, E-3, &amp; F, pp. 15-19, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
formal opposition was filed by the Solicitor General or the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, although the latter, in behalf of the Solicitor
General, cross-examined the applicant and his witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated August 30, 1963, the trial court granted the
petition after finding that petitioner was single at the time he filed the
petition and a Chinese citizen duly registered in the Embassy of the Republic
of Nationalist China and the Bureau of Immigration; that he was born on August
14, 1931 in <span class="SpellE">Chingkang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fookien</span>,
China and arrived in the Philippines on March 13, 1938 (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">rec</span>); that his address at the time of the filing of his
application was Colon-<span class="SpellE">Sudlon</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City; that his full name is Chua Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, his alias having
been given to him by his father since he was a child; that he finished his
secondary course in the University of San Carlos, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Mechanical
Engineering from the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Institute of Technology, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City; that he speaks and writes English and the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect; that he is
presently employed as a regular sales representative at the Erlanger and <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>, Inc., <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> branch, on
commission basis plus bonus since January, 1961, from which he derived an
income of P4,998.68 in 1961 and P9,691.02 in 1962, duly supported by his income
tax returns; that he has no tax liability with the government; "that
during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines from 1938",
he has behaved himself properly; that his moral character is beyond reproach
and he has conducted himself properly in relation to the community in which he
lives as well as with the duly constituted authorities according to witnesses
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> and <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>; that he is not suf­fering from any mental alienation
or any communicable or conta­gious disease nor opposed to organized government,
much less affiliated with groups of persons or associations who uphold and
teach doctrines opposed to organized government; that he has not been convicted
of any crime involving moral turpitude; that he is not a polygamist and he does
not believe in the practice of polygamy nor defend or teach the necessity or
propriety of violence, personal assault or <span class="SpellE">assasination</span>
for the success and predominance of men's ideas; that he has not been accused
of any crime; that he believes in the principles underlying the Philippine
Constitution and demon­strated his knowledge of the same by reciting some
provisions thereof; and that he mingles socially with the Filipinos and has
embraced Filipino customs and traditions and after twenty-five years of
residence in the Philippines, he has acquired the Filipino way of life and
likes the democratic form of government.</p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the aforesaid decision (pp. 43-47, rec.) was received
on September 13, 1963 (see bottom of p. 47, rec.) by the petitioner himself, on
September 14, 1963 by his counsel (p. 49, rec.) and on September 26, 1963 by
the Solicitor General (p. 6, Solicitor General's Brief), who did not appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion to set the case for final hearing (p. 1, rec. on
appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court set the final
hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1965</st1:date>
preparatory to oath-taking (pp. 3-4, rec. on appeal; p. 52, rec.) and reset the
hearing to <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1965</st1:date>
(p. 5, rec. on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 10, 1966, after due hearing, the trial court after
finding that the petitioner has complied with the requirements of Republic Act
No. 530, issued an order allowing him to take his oath of allegiance as a
Filipino citizen after the lapse of thirty days from receipt by the Solicitor
General of the copy of the order (pp. 75-77, rec.; pp. 6-8, rec. on appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="3">March
 24, 1966</st1:date>, the Solicitor General appealed from said order (pp. 8-9,
rec. on appeal) and the record on appeal was approved by the trial court on <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1968</st1:date> (p. 15, rec. on
appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General appealed on the ground that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the petition was not published in full;
(2) the character witnesses who testified for the petitioner were not credible
persons; (3) the petitioner had not conducted himself in an irreproachable
manner; (4) the petitioner lacked lucrative income; and (5) the petitioner
failed to submit his permission to renounce Chinese citizenship from the
Minister of Interior of the Republic of China.</p>

<p class="BODY">This High Tribunal never deviated from its ruling that a
naturalization proceeding is not simply a private contest between the applicant
and the Soli­citor General but is a matter impressed with the highest public
interest, involving as it does an inquiry as to when an alien should be allowed
to enjoy the coveted boon of Filipino citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that the burden of
proof is upon the applicant to show full and complete compliance with the
requirements of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government
can at all stages of the proceeding raise the issue of such non-compliance even
without filing a formal opposition to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the government, it is never too
late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal from the order of the
lower court authorizing the taking of the oath of allegiance subjects the <u>entire</u>
naturalization proceedings to scrutiny by the Supreme Court to determine
whether the applicant has all the qualifications and none of the
disqualifications and whether he has complied with the procedural requirements
of the law, even if those matters are not touched in the briefs or pleadings of
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the government files
an opposition, it is not duty bound to specify the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the applicant fails to estab­lish by
affirmative proof his compliance with the legal requirements, the court should
deny his application.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Because petitioner herein failed to demonstrate by positive
evidence his full and complete compliance with the requirements of the law, his
petition for naturalization should have been denied and the decision granting
his petition as well as the order allowing him to take his oath should be
reversed and set aside.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The law requires that he should allege specifically each of the
six qualifications for naturalization prescribed under Sec. 2 of Com. Act No.
473 (Sec. 7 of Com. Act No. 473).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition does not contain the specific averment that he is of good moral char­acter,
which omission inevitably nullifies his petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The notice of the petition as posted and as published does not
contain the textual or verbatim restatement of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in violation of Sec. 9, Com. Act No.
473, which requirement is jurisdictional.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. He failed to include in his petition his name Chua <u>Ben</u> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> which appears in the record of the Immigration
Bureau according to the certificate of arrival issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1961</st1:date> upon his own request (p. 9, rec.),
over one year prior to the filling of his petition on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has not explained either in his petition or in the course of his
testimony why his name appears differently in the records of the Immigration
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such failure to include such
pseudonym militates against a deci­sion in his favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. He has been using the alias <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> without any judicial authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim that he has been using the same
since childhood as it was given to him by his father, cannot be believed;
because the records of the Immigration Bureau as shown in the certificate of
arrival (p. 9, rec.) is Chua <u>Ben</u> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> as
heretofore stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1938" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1938</st1:date>, when he
was about seven years old as he was born on <st1:date year="1931" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1931</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
his father gave him that alias before 1938, that alias should appear in the
record of the Immigration Bureau as early as 1938.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that his Immigrant
Certificate of Residence dated December 24, 1949 and his Alien Certificate of
Registration dated January 6, 1951 show the said alias (pp. 6-7, rec.), he must
have been sporting that alias only when he was already in his early teens prior
to 1949 in violation of Com. Act No. 142 as he had no judicial authorization <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, which fact bars him from being naturalized.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5. Even if he were judicially authorized to use the alias <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, Com. Act No. 142
requires that such an alias must be used at all times in the execution of any
document with his real name, violation of which is penalized with an
imprisonment of from one month to six months under <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.
3 and 4 of Com. Act No. 142.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner herein used only his alias <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> without his real name Chua Bon <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>
when he executed and signed his marriage contract on <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1965</st1:date>, and his 1963 and 1964 income tax returns
(p. 180, rec., <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B, F &amp; G, pp. 2, 6, 7, rec.
of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This likewise vitiates his petition for it indicates his non-compliance
with our penal laws during the two year-probationary period from the receipt on
September 26, 1963 by the Solicitor General of the decision of August 30, 1963
and that he has not conducted himself in a prop­er and irreproachable manner in
relation with the community in which he lives and with the duly constituted
authorities.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. His character witnesses in their affidavits affirmed that they
know the petitioner only from 1951 when petitioner was already in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to where he transferred in 1947 from <span class="SpellE">Kino­gitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental where he resided from 1938 to 1947 or from
the age of seven to sixteen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No witness
was offered to tes­tify as to his moral character and conduct while he was
residing for nine years in <span class="SpellE">Kinogitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that a minor below nine is exempt from criminal
liability, he is not exempt <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> when he is
above nine but below fifteen if he acted with discernment in the commission of
a crime (Art. 12, pars. 2 &amp; 3, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No police, P.C., N.B.I. and N.I.C.A.
clearances were submitted in connection with his nine-year residence in <span class="SpellE">Kinogitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental from
1938 to 1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such P.C., N.B.I. and
N.I.C.A. clearances were even submitted in evidence concerning his moral
character and conduct while resid­ing in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> since
1947 (p. 28, rec.; p. 1, rec. of <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His good moral character therefore has not
been amply established to the satisfaction of this Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. He has not secured the permission of the Chinese Minister of
Interior from the Republic of Nationalist China to allow him to renounce
Chinese citizenship, which is required so that the applicant may not entertain
double allegiance to the pre­judice of his country of original citizenship or
to the country of his new nationality, and as an added assurance that he is
sincere in his application for naturalization and that, once naturalized, he
will owe loyalty only to the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As early as 1965, this Supreme Tribunal has so decreed in the case of Go
A. <span class="SpellE">Leng</span> vs. Republic.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
And We likewise ruled that petitioner must comply with the laws of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
requiring such special permission from its Minister of Interior.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">8. Finally, petitioner has not also by clear and convincing
evidence established that he has a stable and lucrative income; because his
income is only from commission and bonuses as sales representative of Erlanger
and <span class="SpellE">Galinger</span>, Inc. which are speculative, if not
nebulous, and therefore inadequate and unstable because of the fluidity of the
market.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1963</st1:date> and the order of the
trial court dated <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1966</st1:date>
