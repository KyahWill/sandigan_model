				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this appeal from a lower court decision granting a petition
for naturalization, there is an insistence on the part of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to an objection raised but not favorably considered by the trial judge, namely
the failure of the applicant for citizenship to comply with the statutory
requirement to register his seven minor children with the Bureau of Immigration
under the Alien Registration Act<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
during the prescribed statutory period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
failed not once but seven times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, he had to pay a fine on each occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the lower court did not look
upon such a flaw in his conduct as depriving it of the quality of propriety and
irreproachability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot agree with
such a conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sustain the appeal
and reverse the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the petition for naturalization filed by Yu Chuan, the
Republic of the Philippines on July 20, 1965 filed an opposition on the ground
that the petitioner, having been administratively fined seven times by the
Bureau of Immigration for the late registration of his seven minor children
contrary to the Alien Registration Act, cannot be said to have conducted
himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during the entire period of his
residence in the Philippines.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such an opposition did not prosper, however, as according to the lower court
decision of July 7, 1966 he had satisfactorily explained his failure to
register his children on time on the ground that at the time of their birth
they were sickly, relying likewise on the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>
Guan Tan v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where such an omission was held as not sufficient to disqualify an applicant
for naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion of
the lower court was assailed as error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such indeed is the case, for the <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>
Guan Tan doctrine was abandoned three years later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Co v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
there was this express pronouncement:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is contended that petitioner has also failed to comply with
this legal requirement for he failed to show that he has complied with his
obligation to register his wife and child with the Bureau of Immigration as
required by the Alien Registration Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has, therefore, failed to conduct himself in a proper and
irreproachable manner in his relation with our government." Two years
later, in Chung Hong v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was shown that the applicant never registered two of his children and
that he was late in registering his other minor children, his conduct was
characterized as "fatal to his petition." In a 1965 decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
there was a reiteration of such a doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We did so again just four months before the decision of the lower court
on <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1966">July 7, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Such failure of the petitioner to register his children with the
Bureau of Immigration within the first sixty days of every calendar year
constitutes a clear violation of the section above-quoted that renders the
applicant's conduct far from being proper and irreproachable."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It would be to overturn the above controlling decisions, thereÂ­fore,
if we were to sustain the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason why we should do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, the contrary is precisely indicated for if there is
any principle consistently adhered to in this kind of cases, it is that the
privilege of Filipino citizenship can be enjoyed only by the deserving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, an individual who fails to comply
with what the law requires hardly belongs to such a category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If prior to the institution of his suit for
citizenship, he had already manifested such a far-from-commendable tendency, it
is not unreasonable to assume that if mistakenly his application for
citizenship were approved, there is not likely to be, by that mere fact alone,
a radical change in his conduct and an assurance that thereafter he could be
expected to behave in a manner less objectionable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, his petition for naturalization ought to have failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court decided otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its decision cannot command our assent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court decision of <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1966">July 7, 1966</st1:date> granting the petition for
naturalization of Yu Chuan is reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With costs against petitioner Yu Chuan.</span></p>
