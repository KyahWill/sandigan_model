				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental dismissing a third-party complaint was
certified to us by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic question tendered for resolution is whether the
third-party complaint states a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">A concise narration of the essential antecedent events is
contained in the resolution of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1984</st1:date>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On January 23, 1962, the La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
Cigar and Cigarette Factory filed an action for a sum of money, allegedly
representing the value of cigarettes purchased on credit from it, before the of
Court First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental against the
Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>,
the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Talisay-Silay</span></span><span class="GramE"> Milling Company, Inc. and J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
motion by the defendants J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Company, Inc., the
complaint was dismissed against them, thereby leaving the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> the sole
defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On June 15, 1962, the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> turned against the two discharged
defendants by filing a third-party complaint against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of the two third-party defendants
the third-party complaint was also dismissed for lack of a sufficient cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this
appeal."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Liability for payment of the amount claimed by the plaintiff La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span> Cigar and Cigarette Factory from the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> (hereinafter
referred to as the Central) is sought to be shifted by the latter to the
third-party defendants <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co.,
Inc. and J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
by the following allegations of the third-party complaint</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a complaint
was filed in this case by plaintiff La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span> Cigar
&amp; Cigarette Factory where­in it is prayed, among other thing that the defendant
be to pay said plaintiff the sum of P8,164.00, plus 12% thereof per annum as
interest from August 10, 1954, allegedly representing the value of several
kinds of cigarettes delivered to the defendant during the period from August
10, 1954, to November 25, 1955; it is also prayed in the complaint that said
defendant be ordered to pay the same plaintiff the amount of P2,000.00 as
damages, another P2,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of this complaint is hereto marked
Annex 'A' thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when the cigarettes
referred to in the complaint Annex 'A' were allegedly delivered to the
third-party plaintiff, about 95% of the shares of stock of said central were
owned by the third-party defendant <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
Milling Co., Inc., and the majority of stock of the latter corporation was in
turn owned by the third-party de­fendant J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
on March 3, 1960 an agreement was entered into by and among the Philippine
National Bank, the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co. Inc. and
the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>
by virtue of which and in consideration of the sums of money mentioned in the
agreement, the Philippine National Bank acquired from the herein third-party defendant
<span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> all its shares of stock in the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of this agreement is hereto attached
marked Annex ‘B’;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
among other things, it was agreed in the agreement Annex ‘B’ [paragraph 9]:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That all obligations of Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> incurred before the date of this Agreement but
not those incurred by the BANK during the period when the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarers</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> was under the
Management of the Bank, in favor of trade creditors for supplies, equipment,
fuel and spare parts, outstanding in the books of <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>
shall be listed and itemized, and only such items as are approved and
acknowledged by the BANK shall be considered as legitimately incurred and due
for <span class="GramE">payment</span> by <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>.'</p>

<blockquote>"8<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> in paragraph 10 of the same agreement Annex 'B', it was
further stipulated:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That any or all obligations purporting to be [those of] Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> del <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> but <u>not
appearing [in] the books thereof</u> nor acknowledge as in paragraph 9 above
[shall] be borne and paid for by <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
Central and/or Mr. J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>.'</p>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the sum of P8,164,00
claimed in the complaint Annex 'A' has never been approved nor acknowledged for
payment by the Philippine National Bank nor by the third-party plaintiff in
accordance with the above-copied provisions of the agreement Annex 'B' hereof,
so payment of said amount, and of the other sums of money claimed in the
complaint Annex 'A' remained to be the obligation of the third-party
defendants, <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co., Inc. and/or <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of repeated demand's made by the plaintiff and
third-party plaintiff upon the third-party defendants, the latter have re­fused
and until now refuse to pay said amounts claimed in the complaint; * * *"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Attacking the sufficiency of the third-party complaint the
third-party defendants maintain that under the above-cited paragraph 9 of the
agreement (annex B), their liability for the obligations incurred by the
Central prior to the date of the said agreement that is, before March 3, 1960,
attach only when it appears that the said obligations are outstanding in the
books of the Central and the same have been listed and itemized but have not
been approved and acknowledged by the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebutting this argument, the Central argues
that all that is necessary to hold the third-party defendants liable is the
allegation that the said ac­counts have not been acknowledged and approved by
the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further
posits that the foregoing contention of the third-party defendants is a matter
of defense which need not be alleged nor anticipated in the third-party
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curiously, both parties
anchored their respective positions only on paragraph 9 of the agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, as previously stated, sustained
the position of the third-party defendants and accordingly dismissed the
third-party complaint for failure to state a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful analysis of the above-quoted paragraph 9 and 10 of
the agreement, it is our view that both parties are equally mistaken in so far
as they invoke only paragraph 9 in support of their respective contentions, and
that paragraph 10 of the agreement is likewise determinative of the issue in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under paragraph 9, (1) all obligations of the Central incurred
before the date of the agreement in favor of trade creditors for supplies,
equipment, fuel and spare parts which are (a) outstanding in the books of the
Central, (b) listed and itemized, and (c) approved and acknowledged by the Philippine
National Bank, shall be paid by the Central; and (2) all obligations incurred
by the Central during the period when it was under management by the Philippine
National Bank shall be paid by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under paragraph 10, all obligations incurred before the date of the
agreement and purporting to be those of the Central but <u>not appearing in the
book thereof</u> nor acknowledged as in paragraph 9 above shall be borne and
paid for by the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co., Inc.
and/or by J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, an allegation that the obligations are outstanding in the
books of the Central and the same are listed and itemized is necessary to
charge liability against the Central not against the third-party
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the <u>absence</u>
of the foregoing circumstances--appearance in the book listing and
itemization--shall cause the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Co., Inc.
and/or J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> to
be liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be assumed that the foregoing arrangement was made
because if the obligations incurred before the date of the agreement do not
appear in the books of the Central, then the Philippine National Bank, which
subsequently took over control of the said Central, could not be expected to
know and later approve and acknowledge such obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such obligations must be assumed by the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co., Inc., the former owner of the
controlling interest in the Central, and/or J. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, president of the Central and the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co., Inc., who represented the two
corporations in the agreement, unless of course, the Philippine National Bank
chose to approve and acknowledge such obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the third-party complaint is not necessarily defective for
failure to allege that the obligation in question is outstanding in the books
of the Central and the same has been listed and itemized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a positive allegation could in fact
negative the liability of the third-party defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the third-party complaint is fatally insufficient
for failure to aver that the obligation which is the subject of the plaintiff's
claim <u>does not appear in the books</u> of the Central, even if it does
allege that the obligation in question "has never been approved nor
acknowledged for payment by the Philippine National Bank." Because and on
the basis of this omission, we upheld the order of dismissal on the same ground
- failure to state a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The test of the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged in the
complaint to constitute a cause of <span class="GramE">action,</span> is whether
or not, admitting the facts alleged, the court could render a valid judgment
upon the same in accordance with the prayer of the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, the third-party complaint in dispute fails this test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the truth of the facts alleged in the
third-party complaint were admitted, the failure to allege that the obligation
in question does not appear in the books of the Central is a fatal
omission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liability of the third-party
defendants arises from and is defined by the above-mentioned agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the essential conditions stipulated
in the said agreement which would give rise to such liability must be alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, no cause of action would accrue
and no valid judgment could be rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">To recapitulate, the third-party complaint would have stated a
cause of action (1) if it had averred not only that the obligation in question
was not approved or acknowledged by the Philippine National Bank but as well
that it is outstanding in the books of the Central and is listed and itemized;
or, in the alternative, (2) if it had alleged that the obligation purports to be
one of the Central but does not appear in the books thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1962</st1:date> is affirmed, without prejudice to the
filing of another action in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
