  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appeal, by defendants <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava, Nicolas B. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> and William D. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, from a decision, of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, finding Nava and <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
guilty of the "complex crime of rebellion with multiple murder and

thousand pesos (P5,000.00), without subsidiary imprisonment in case of

one-fourth (1/4) of the costs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Said appellants are accused, together with one Crispin <span class="SpellE">Aureal</span> and 20 other persons,<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><sup><font color="#ff0000">[3]</font></sup></span>
who are still at large, of the crime of "rebellion with multiple murder
and arson," in an amended information, dated November 22, 1950,
containing twenty-four (24) specifications, which are summarized in
said pleading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That during the period from January 1, 1949, up to the present time, in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>
and other municipalities of Iloilo province and in the city of Iloilo,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the above-named
defendants, conspiring, confederating, and working together with about
600 others, whose identities, are still unknown and with the object of
overthrowing the Government, banding and arming themselves together and
organizing a purported army, and affiliating with the HMB, an
insurrectionary organization in Luzon, for the purpose of forcibly
removing from power, His Excellency the present President of the
Philippines and other high government officials or of overthrowing the
present Government and to replace it with one of their own making, did
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously engage in plotting and organizing rebellious movements, in
circulating seditious and revolutionary pamphlets, and rise publicly
and take up arm against the Government or its agencies by raiding
municipal buildings, barrios, and towns and looting them, killing
Government officials and employees and civilians, ambushing police and
constabulary patrols, and engaging in actual killing shooting: and
skirmishing with the police and Philippine Army and Constabulary forces
and setting fire to dwelling houses of the inhabitants, in the manner
herein set forth, to wit:" (Here follow the 24 specific counts).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When the case was called for trial of said four (4) defendants, Crispin <span class="SpellE">Aureal</span>
withdrew his former plea of "not guilty" and entered, in lieu thereof,
that of "guilty", whereupon he was sentenced accordingly, in a separate
decision. Then herein appellant" were tried. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence against appellant <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
consists mainly of the testimony of Alfredo Aguilar, to the effect —and
the lower court found—that, en October 15, 1959, at about 9:00 a.m.,
Aguilar delivered to <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, in his gun store (Filipino Gun Store) in the city of Iloilo, a latter of <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> commander "Roland", addressed to <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, and the sum of P210, which, together with said letter, had been brought to the law office of appellant <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, in the same city, that morning, at about 8 o'clock, by a woman called "Cherry", who was a special <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> courier; that, after reading said letter, <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
showed to Aguilar fifty (50) clips and two-hundred (200) rounds of
ammunition, caliber .30, for rifle, and bade him (Aguilar) to tell
Cherry to wait for him (<span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>) in said office of <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> that afternoon, at three o'clock; that <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Centeno's</span>
office at said time, bringing with him a package, one foot and
one-fourth long and eleven inches in width, containing six-hundred
(600) rounds of ammunition for rifle, caliber .30, which ho delivered
to Cherry; and that before Cherry, who left immediately, was gone, <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
said to her: "You tell Roland that this ammunition came from me, and if
he needs more ammunition, he should send money because for the present,
there are yet plenty in my possession."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The prosecution introduced, also, the testimony of A. <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>,
an adjutant in the headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary in
Iloilo, who declared that, in a search made on November 15, 1950, two
(2) pistols, one (1) revolver, fourteen (14) magazines, sixteen (16) <span class="SpellE">Garand</span> clips and three hundred eighty-nine (389) rounds of ammunition were found in said gun store of <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
not entered in the records thereof, despite the fact that his previous
authority—as chief informer of the PC operatives in the province of
Iloilo, who, as such, had rendered valuable services to the
Government—to purchase and/or retrieve loose, unlicensed and/or
surrendered firearms and ammunitions had been cancelled since October
25, 1950, and that he had then been instructed to turn over to said
headquarters, within two (2) days, such firearms and ammunitions as he
may have acquired prior thereto, in pursuance of said authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Regalado</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> denied the truth of the aforementioned testimony of Aguilar, as well as being a Communist or a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>,
and asserted that his store was closed and he did not go thereto on
October 15, 1950, because it was Sunday, and he was then in the Iloilo
Rifle Association since 8:15 a.m., and then in the Villa Beach Club of
Iloilo, from 10:45 a.m. to late in the afternoon. <span class="SpellE">Fidencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Varona</span> corroborated <span class="SpellE">Regalado's</span> story as to his aforementioned presence in the Villa Beach Club. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
explained, also, that some of the firearms found in his store on
November 15, 1950, were there solely for cleaning and nickel plating
purposes, and that his failure to report to the Constabulary the
presence in said store of the unlicensed firearms and the ammunitions
therein seized by the Constabulary, on that date, was due to the fact
that said objects were acquired by him only 4 days prior thereto, and
that his report for November, 1950 was not due until the end of that
month, when he was already under investigation by the authorities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We
find the testimony of prosecution witness Alfredo Aguilar unworthy of
credence. His story on the witness stand bears strong earmarks of lack
of veracity. For instance, he would have us believe that he went to the
law office of appellant <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> in the morning of October 15, 1950, because he (Aguilar) was a clerk of the latter, who bade him to deliver to <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
the letter of Commander Roland and the sum of P210.00 brought by Cherry
for the purchase of ammunition; that, after giving this instruction, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> left him (Aguilar) with Cherry, stating that he (<span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>) was going to the court in connection with the hearing of a case; and that he (Aguilar) was present when <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> delivered six hundred (600) rounds of ammunition to Cherry in said law office that afternoon. It appears, however, that </span><st1:date month="10" day="15" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 15, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> was Sunday, so that Aguilar could not have then reported for work, and <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> could not have possibly told him that he (<span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>)
was then going to court. For the same reason, it is incredible that, by
proceeding directly to the Filipino Gun Store, Aguilar found <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> therein, although it was Sunday, and there had been no previous agreement to meet there, on that date. Similarly, had <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>
delivered six hundred (600) rounds of ammunition to Cherry upon payment
of the sum of two hundred ten pesos (P210.00), as supposedly directed
or requested in a letter of Commander Roland to <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
it would have been patently unnecessary for this appellant to remind
Cherry to tell Roland that the ammunition had come from him (<span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>). Again, Aguilar asserted that, upon receipt of the package containing six hundred (600) rounds of ammunition, Cherry left <span class="SpellE">Centeno's</span> law office with the package "under her arms" or "under her arm pit," as if the package were so light that a woman could easily <span class="GramE">carry</span>
it. Yet, defense counsel avers, and the prosecution does not deny, that
His Honor, the Trial Judge, found, in open court that a bag containing
600 rounds of rifle ammunition caliber .30 was so heavy that he could
not, or found it difficult to, lift it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The evidence against <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> is clearly insufficient, therefore, to establish the crime charged. What is more, said evidence suggests that <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> is neither a Communist nor a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>.
Otherwise, why should he demand a monetary consideration for the
ammunition he allegedly delivered to Cherry? Why should he bid her to
allegedly remind Commander Roland of the necessity of sending more
money if he (Roland) wanted more ammunition? And why should this
alleged message be limited only to ammunition, instead of including,
also, arms? Even if the evidence for the <span class="SpellE">defence</span> were entirely disregarded, the most that could be said about <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>—if
the proof for the prosecution were given full faith and credence—would
be that he did not care who bought the ammunition, provided its price
was paid to him. This act is not punishable under our laws on
rebellion, although it might, under certain conditions, constitute a
crime if committed in relation to treason (Art. 116, Revised Penal
Code).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With respect to appellant Nicolas B. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>,
only two (2) of the twenty-four (24) specifications contained in the
amended information herein, dated November 22, 1950, make any express
reference to him. It is alleged in count <span class="GramE">No</span>. XX that, during the period from September, 1949 to said date, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
had, together with the other defendants, circulated insurrectionary
articles and pamphlets; delivered, advocated and propagated highly
seditious and revolutionary ideas incompatible with the permanence of
the government; furnished, provided arid supplied the HMB with arms,
ammunitions, and provisions; and risen publicly, as well as taken up
arms, against the Government, for the purpose of replacing it with
another. <span class="GramE">The allegations under count No.</span> XXIV are to the effect that, for said purpose, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
and his co-defendants had, during the period from September, 1949, to
September, 1950, organized the People's Liberation Army, the object of
which is to fight the Government of the Philippines and its armed
forces; established the People's Institute in several specified places
in the province of Iloilo, to indoctrinate the students therein "in
highly seditious and revolutionary ideas and communistic principles
incompatible with the permanency of the present, Government"; held
meetings and formed "concentrations" in specified localities, "for the
purpose of giving military indoctrination and/or indoctrinating
communistic principles to the members of HMB organization"; solicited,
asked and compelled several persons to join said organization; and
solicited funds and supplies from other persons for the maintenance,
aid and support of the aforementioned organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">More specifically, the prosecution sought to prove; that <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> is a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>,
who, as such, is known as "Peter"; that, on the first Sunday of April,
1949—or beyond the period covered by the above-mentioned
specifications—he spoke in a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> meeting in <span class="SpellE">Borak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>, province of Iloilo, and urged the audience to help him and one <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> <span class="SpellE">Menaje</span> gather arms with which to fight the Government; that on the last Sunday of July, 1949, he went to <span class="SpellE">Bantay</span>, Santa Barbara, of the same province, together with two (2) men, carrying a sack, containing two (2) dismantled <span class="SpellE">Thompsons</span>, which were delivered to <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Patrimonio</span>, a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> known as <span class="SpellE">Kulafu</span>, who was assured by <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> that he would endeavor to get more <span class="SpellE">Thompsons</span>; that, sometime in September, 1949. he attended a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> conference in the house of <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> <span class="SpellE">Menaje</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Tigbanua</span>, municipality of <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>, and discussed therein the functions of the People's Democratic Unity; that on October 15, 1950, the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> courier "Cherry" brought to <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, in his law office in the City of Iloilo, Roland's aforementioned letter to appellant <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, and some money for ammunition, whereupon <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> bade his clerk Alfredo Aguilar to take said letter and money to <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, in his gun store in Iloilo, and that afternoon <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> delivered six hundred (600) rounds of ammunition to Cherry in said office of <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, who, however, was not present then; that, upon instructions of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Capadocia</span>, head of the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> in the province of <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span>, Rodrigo de Jesus contacted <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> that same month and year, about the arms and ammunitions he had agreed to send to the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>, and asked him to continue supplying the same with said materials, to which <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
replied that he had already furnished some arms and ammunitions to the
organization and promised to send more; that, several days later, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
delivered to Cherry a package saying that it contained a Thompson and
ammunition; and that in August, October and November, 1950, <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> courier <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> brought letters of commander Roland (<span class="SpellE">Peregrino</span> <span class="SpellE">Atimonana</span>) to <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon a review of the record, we find that the prosecution—whose main evidence against <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> consisted of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Lidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span> <span class="SpellE">Moñesa</span>, <span class="GramE">Rodrigo</span> de Jesus. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Penetrante</span>, Alfredo Aguilar and <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span>—<span class="GramE">has</span> not satisfactorily established the guilt of said appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To
begin with, prosecution witness Alfredo Aguilar confirmed his
testimony, in the preliminary investigation, to the effect that, when
Cherry allegedly contacted <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> in his law office, on </span><st1:date month="10" day="15" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 15, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, she told him that <i style="">trigger men would be sent to kill him</i>, unless he helped the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> in the acquisition of ammunitions. Such threat patently shows that <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> was not a Communist or a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Secondly, the necessity of so intimidating him, in order to secure <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">privately</span></em> his assistance in getting ammunitions for the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>,
as late as October 15, 1950, strongly indicates that he must have been
wanting, prior thereto, in tokens of cooperation with the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> movement. In other words, said admission by Alfredo Aguilar belies the theory of the prosecution to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
was one of the organizers of the People's Liberation Army and of the
People's Institute, and that, as early as April, 1949, he had spoken <i style="">publicly</i> in <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> meetings and urged the people to help the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> in their fight against the government; that he personally went to <span class="SpellE">Kulafu</span>, on the last Sunday of July, 1949, with two (2) men to deliver a sack containing two (2) dismantled <span class="SpellE">Thompsons</span>; or that he performed the other acts imputed to him by the witnesses for the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thirdly, it has been proven—by the testimony of Salvador <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Jamelo</span>, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Hardok</span> and Ruben <span class="SpellE">Jardenazo</span>—that Rodrigo de Jesus, one of the principal witnesses for the prosecution, had been the <span class="SpellE">VicePresident</span> of the Democratic Peasant-Workers' Union, of which <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> was the President; that a disagreement ensued between both, because De Jesus wanted that part of <span class="SpellE">Centeno's</span> income as a lawyer be turned over to the Union or its officers; and that De Jesus was expelled from the Union for, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></em>, he had allegedly collected <span class="SpellE">palay</span> from its members without <span class="SpellE">Centeno's</span> authority and failed to account <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
to the Union. Apart from materially affecting the credibility and
weight of the testimony of De Jesus, his dismissal from the Democratic
Peasant-Workers' </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Union</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is an additional indication that <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> was not a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>, <span class="GramE">for,</span> otherwise, he would not have dared to expel De Jesus, who was a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> political supervisor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Fourthly,
as a practicing lawyer and president of the aforementioned Union—aside
from being the local chairman of the "Laurel for President" movement—<span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> had <span class="SpellE">spoused</span>
the cause of tenants in about 300 tenancy cases, and preferred
administrative charges against members of the Constabulary, some of
whom were, as a consequence, transferred elsewhere, because of which he
had earned the animosity of certain influential sectors of the
community, as well as of some officers of the Constabulary. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Fifthly,
in addition to the fact that the testimony of Alfredo Aguilar regarding
the alleged deal with Cherry in the law office of <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
on October 15, 1950, is inherently incredible, this appellant has
presented an impressive array of witnesses whose testimony indicates
that <span class="SpellE">Ccntono</span> could not have been, either in <span class="SpellE">Borak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>, on the first Sunday of April, 1949, or in <span class="SpellE">Bantay</span>, Sta. Barbara, on the last Sunday of July, 1949, or in <span class="SpellE">Tigbaua</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>,
in September, 1949; or performed the ether acts testified to by the
witnesses for the prosecution. In this connection, 24 witnesses
testified for appellant <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span><span class="GramE">,</span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><sup><font color="#ff0000">[4]</font></sup></span> aside from the 13 citizens of high standing in the community <span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><sup><font color="#ff0000">[5]</font></sup></span> who vouched for his good moral character. <br></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As regards appellant <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava, the lower court found:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"*
* * (1) that he was at the time of the commission of the crime charged
a member of the HMB, as convincingly testified to by Rodrigo de Jesus,
was even present when <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> in blood on a piece of paper in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Kipot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>, Iloilo, on January 1, 1030, when he, <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava, was formally inducted as a member of the HMB; (2) that on December 27, 1949, he, in company of Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Capadocia</span>, Norma Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Gonzales, <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span class="SpellE">Patrimonio</span> and Rodrigo de Jesus, all <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> officials, held a meeting in barrio <span class="SpellE">Dagame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>,
Iloilo, at which meeting the people were incited to join the HMB in its
fight against the Government; (3) that he attended and underwent
indoctrination in the People Military Academy' of the HMB in said
barrio of <span class="SpellE">Kipot</span> for 18 days beginning the
last week of January, 1950, as De Jesus categorically affirmed in his
testimony; (4) that he delivered a speech in the HMB meeting in barrio <span class="SpellE">Cabacanan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alimodian</span>, on December 10, 1949, as well as in the HMB meeting in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Kipot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>, on December 29, 1949, and in the meeting of the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> in barrio <span class="SpellE">Tigbauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>,
in August, 1950, urging the people to feed and join the HMB in the

confined for three (3) days. This was established, not only by the

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore,
appellant's testimony denying that he had undergone indoctrination in
the "People's Military Academy" in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Kipot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Janiuay</span>,
for a period of 18 days, from the last week of January, 3950, has been
sufficiently corroborated by testimonial and documentary evidence
establishing his presence in the city of Iloilo on January 18 and 20,
1950; in La Carlota, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental,
from February 12 to February 21, 1950, in connection with a labor
strike in that locality, in Manila, from February 22 to February 25,
1950, and, immediately thereafter, in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>,
followed, on March 7, 1959, by a trip back to Manila, where he stayed
up to March 13, 1950; and then his return to the city of Iloilo, where
he attended a meeting of the FOF, held on March 16, 1950.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true, that there is no direct evidence corroborating his testimony on his actual presence in said city from January 20 to </span><st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 11, 1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. But, then, it is impossible for anybody in this world to introduce corroborative evidence of his actual <span class="SpellE">situs</span>
every day of his life. In fact, we would, perhaps, be justified in
doubting the veracity of Nava's testimony, had he introduced such
corroborative evidence as to his presence in the city of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">
on each and every one of the dates specifically referred to by the
witnesses for the prosecution. The important thing is that said
testimony of appellant Nava has been so corroborated on many points as
to indicate its general adherence to objective truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thus, his testimony denying that he was in the house of <span class="SpellE">Placido</span> <span class="SpellE">Menaje</span> in <span class="SpellE">Tigbauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maasin</span>
on September 13, 1950, and that, on another day, during the same month,
he and some members of the "People's Democratic Unity" had sent Ramon <span class="SpellE">Reiteracion</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> to the city of Iloilo to get firearms and ammunition, supposedly in connection with the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> movement, was similarly corroborated by the established fact: (a) that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Mabunay</span>
treated him in said city on September 3, 9, 20 and 29, 1950; (b) that
an annex to appellant's house in that city was constructed from late in
August to late September, 1950, during which time he was in the city
supervising said construction work and was seen therein by carpenters
Jose Almeida and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Quibao</span>, and mason <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarad</span>, who tock part in said work, and by Jose Salvador, driver of the truck who delivered sand and gravel needed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>;
(c) that on September 8, 15 and 25, 1950, he paid in Iloilo city his
accounts for said materials; (d) that he was in said city on August 15
and September 16, 1950, when his electric meter was read by an agent
(Jesus <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>) of the enterprise
operating the electric service; and (e) that he was in the same city on
September 2, 14 and 22, 1950, when one <span class="SpellE">Olizen</span> made certain payments to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not overlook the general rule that positive testimony as to the presence of the accused at the scene of <span class="SpellE">tho</span>
offense b stronger than negative testimony to the contrary. However,
the evidence for the prosecution in this, case came from sources that
cannot be characterized as fully unbiased and disinterested. Most of
the principal witnesses for the prosecution <span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><sup><font color="#ff0000">[6]</font></sup></span> against <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span>
Nava were political detainees, who could not help but fool that their
fate in the hands of the government depended upon the assistance they
may give thereto in thee prosecution of said appellant. Moreover, there
is, at best, a reasonable possibility that said witnesses for the
prosecution may have been misled into concluding that <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava must have been with the dissidents in the places mentioned in their testimony, because a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> known by the name of Diego <span class="SpellE">Silang</span> had allegedly been present in those places, and the prosecution contends that Diego <span class="SpellE">Silang</span> and appellant Nava are one and the same person. The defense, however, introduced evidence<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span> which can not be lightly brushed aside or disregarded, to the effect that Diego <span class="SpellE">Silang</span> is, not <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava, but another person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon
the other hand, the testimony of the witnesses for the defense b, also,
positive as to appellant's presence in some other place than that
claimed by the prosecution, and a good number of said witnesses had no
particular interest in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, their testimony was substantially corroborated by documentary evidence, consisting, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></em>
of receipts, bookkeeping entries, records of shipping companies and
photographs, in some of which public officers, including an officer of
the Constabulary who testified for the prosecution, appear. Then too,
the number of witnesses—though not <i style="">per se</i> controlling
or decisive—is a factor that adds weight to Nava's alibi. Indeed 47
witnesses testified in corroboration of his testimony, <span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span> and "no reason whatsoever was given" by the lower court "for disbelieving" their testimony (People <span class="SpellE"><i style="">vs</i></span><i style="">,</i> <span class="SpellE">Palmones</span>, 61 Phil. 680, 688-G89). Moreover, as in the case of People <i style="">vs</i>.
Gonzales (50 Phil. 9, 13-14), "it seems evident that the principal
witnesses for the prosecution did not tell the unvarnished truth," in
the same manner as "it is quite possible that" the witnesses for the
defense "in the main told the truth." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In conclusion, we find that the evidence on record does not adequately establish the guilt of appellants <span class="SpellE">Flavio</span> Nava, Nicolas C. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> and William D. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
in view of which the decision appealed from should he, as it is hereby,
