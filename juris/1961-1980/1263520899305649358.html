				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by petitioners-plaintiffs from the decision of the Court
of Appeals (in CA-G. R. No. 36043-R) affirming the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 54369), with the sole modification
that plaintiffs are ordered to pay defendant (respondent herein) the sum of
P50,000.00 as temperate damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are herein stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellants are lessees of defendant's premises located
at Nos. 686, 688 and <st1:address><st1:street>690 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
  Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>, where they
also conduct their respective businesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lease was oral and on a month-to-month basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs have been occupying the premises
for a period of from <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10</st1:time> to 15 years
as of the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5">8 May 1962</st1:date>, defendant started sending
out to each of said plaintiffs notices to vacate the premises to give way for
the demo­lition of the old building occupied by them and the eventual cons­truction
of a new one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notices were received
by plaintiffs on their respective dates, namely, <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5">8 May 1962</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="9">21
 September 1962</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="10">10
 October 1962</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15
 January 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of the
said notices gave plaintiffs a period of time within which to move out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last notice gave said plaintiffs 24 hours
within which to vacate the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="1">16 January 1963</st1:date>,
as previously scheduled, defendant started the demolition of the roofing and
upper sidings of the building and also the fencing thereof, although the
demolition of the back portion actually started on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="1">7 January 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="1">17 January 1963</st1:date>,
plaintiffs filed a complaint for forcible entry with the City Court against
defendant, praying, among others, for a writ of preliminary injunction (which
was granted) and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
counterclaimed for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and damages for alleged
loss of the use and occupation of his premises in the form of (a) fixed losses
in the amount of P177,869.06; (b) monthly losses in the amount of P27,295.00
from <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15 January 1963</st1:date>; and
(c) P1,000.00 daily losses, also from <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15
 January 1963</st1:date>, until possession is restored.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="2">23 February 1963</st1:date>,
the City Court rendered its decision in favor of plaintiffs, later amended on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="5">24 May 1963</st1:date> because of the
intervening Compromise Agreement between plaintiff Go Ban and de­fendant, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the COMPROMISE AGREEMENT between Go Ban and the
defendant is hereby approved and judgment is hereby rendered in conformity
therewith; the lease agreement between Alberto T. Reyes, Lorenzo Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>, on one hand
and the defendant on the other hereby extended to one (1) year from 23 February
1963 at the same rate (P800.00 a month); declaring the preliminary injunction
here­tofore issued enjoining the defendant from further performing acts of
demolition of the premises here­by declared permanent during the period of the
intended lease, and ordering the defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, Jr., to restore the premises to the same condition
as they were before demolition started, particularly restoring the roofing of
the premises and removing the fence thereon constructed within three (3) days
from receipt hereof; ordering the defendant to pay unto each of plaintiffs,
except Go Ban, compensatory damages for the impairment caused on their business
establishment at the rate of TWENTY-FIVE PESOS (P25.00) a day from 16 January
1963 until the premises shall have been restored to its former condition; to
pay the sum of TWO HUNDRED PESOS (P200.00) as attorney's fees, plus the costs
of the suit."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant's counterclaim for want of merit is hereby
dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendant appealed the aforesaid decision to the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision dated <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="1">11 January 1965</st1:date>, later amended on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="2">11 February 1965</st1:date>, the said Court
dismissed the complaint and all claims and counterclaims, among others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the decision follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment, dismissing the
complaint and all claims and counterclaims; ordering plaintiff Alberto Reyes to
pay the P800.00 monthly rentals for and beginning with November, 1962, until he
vacates the premises; ordering each of plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> and Lorenzo Hernandez to pay defendant the
P800.00 monthly rentals from 15 January 1963 until they vacate the premises;
ordering the plaintiffs to vacate the premises designated as Nos. 686, 688 and
690 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, Manila, immediately from and after
the date this judgment becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The preliminary injunction is hereby ordered dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals which, in turn,
rendered its decision on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="11">21 November
 1967</st1:date>, affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance, with
the sole modification that plaintiffs should also pay to defendant <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> the sum of P50,000.00 as temperate damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision is quoted below:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with the sole modification that plaintiffs are
ordered to pay defendant the sum of P50,000.00 as temperate damages, the
decision appealed from is AFFIRMED in all other respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs in this instance against the plaintiffs
in favor of defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the appeal by plaintiffs to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following errors are assigned in their
brief:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals erred in -</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether respondent took the law in his own hands is
clearly factual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It invites calibration
of the whole evidence, con­sidering mainly the credibility of witnesses,
existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation
to each other and to the whole, and the probabilities of the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a question of fact, it is for the Court
of Appeals to decide<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
and its findings will not be disturbed by this Court unless clearly baseless or
irrational.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The exceptions do not obtain in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been clearly established in the foregoing that respondent
was assured of petitioners' vacating the premises after the Christmas season,
specifically on or before <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15 January
 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent was putting
up a P1,700,000, 9-story, building in lieu of the old one occupied by
petitioners, among other tenants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
early as <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5">8 May 1962</st1:date>, peti­tioners
had been already notified "to vacate within 60 days" from said
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners requested for an
extension until after the Christmas season for the reason that the 60-day
period was insufficient for peti­tioners to move their respective businesses to
new places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, respondent
completed solution of the technical problems of the proposed building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The services of architect Juan <span class="SpellE">Nakpil</span> were contracted; the loan applications for the
project were followed up; muni­cipal licenses were secured and paid for so that
the construction could be started; and a number of guards were even hired to
secure the site of the new building.</p>

<p class="BODY">From <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="5">8 May 1962</st1:date>,
three more notices were sent to petitioners, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="9">21 September 1962</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="10">10 October 1962</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15 January 1963</st1:date>, that construction would commence after
the Christmas season.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These notices were
not questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, and as
found by the Court of Appeals, petitioners led respondent to believe that the
premises would be voluntarily vacated on or before <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15 January 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, when the respondent started demolishing the back part of the
building on <st1:date year="1963" day="7" month="1">7 January 1963</st1:date>,
which fact was known to petitioners, nothing was done to protest the demolition
or ask for another ex­tension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="1">16 January 1963</st1:date>, when the demolition
of the old building reached the portion tenanted by petitioners, petitioners
saw res­pondent merely to get a written assurance of priority in leasing out
spaces in the new building but not for another extension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the foregoing circumstances, it can hardly be believed that
respondent forcibly entered the leased premises and took the law in his own
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The given assurance of vacating
on or before <st1:date year="1963" day="15" month="1">15 Jan­uary 1963</st1:date>
was clearly proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's belief
in good faith that tenant petitioners would leave voluntarily as scheduled was
well-founded, not only because of the uncontested reminders to vacate but also
because of petitioners' passive attitude when, finally, the demo­lition
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, therefore, that
petitioners reneged on their promise and chose to continue staying in the
premises at the time the scheduled demolition took place should not be taken
against res­pondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view hereof,
there is no reason to disturb the Court of Appeals' finding that "the
defendant's act of ordering the fencing of the premises could not be considered
done in bad faith ….. (or) that he took the law in his own hands".<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> A
pronouncement of good faith cannot be reviewed on appeal by certiorari,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
especially since We find no conflict in the Court of Appeals' findings in this
regard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue was raised in Appellants' Brief but not in the
main petition for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
alleged that the Court of Appeals refused to decide the second and third
assignments of error presented by plaintiffs in their appeal to the said Court,
which are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the Court of First
Instance erred in not granting plaintiffs-appellants' motion for the execution
of the mandatory injunctive relief granted in the City Court decision for
failure of the defendant-appellant to restore the <span class="SpellE">roofings</span>
and remove the fence constructed thereon within three days from receipt of the
decision and/or to pay the sum of P25.00 compensatory damages daily to each of
the plaintiffs-appellants until the premises are restored to their former
condition; and (b) in ordering each of the plaintiffs-appellants to pay P800.00
monthly rental in the premises under its present condition, devoid of <span class="SpellE">roofings</span> and with fencing on their frontage for at least
one year subsequent to the filing of this action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1948<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
partly provides that "every decision of the Court of Appeals shall contain
complete findings of fact on all issues properly raised before it".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision has been reproduced in Section
4, Rule 51, of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of Ramos, et al. vs. Ramos, et al.,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
it has been held that the law does not impose on the Court of Appeals the duty
of stating complete findings of facts on all errors assigned but merely on all
issues <u>properly</u> raised before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled in this jurisdiction that, in a trial <u>de
novo</u> on appeal, the Court of First Instance will not affirm, reverse, or
modify the judgment appealed from inferior courts, for the simple reason that
there is no judgment to affirm or modify, because all the proceedings had in
the Municipal Court, including the judgment, do not in contem­plation of law
exist, having been vacated upon perfection of the appeal; and the only instance
when said judgment appealed from is revived is when the appeal is withdrawn or
dismissed.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
For under Section 9, Rule 40, of the Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> a
"perfected appeal" from the city court to the court of first instance
"shall operate to vacate the judgment" of the city court, and
"the action when duly docketed in the court of first instance shall stand
for trial <u>de novo</u> upon its merits, in accordance with the regular
procedure in that court, as though the same had never been tried before and was
originally there commenced."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Since all the proceedings in the city court including the judgment become, as
it were, inexistent in case of appeal to the Court of First Instance, and since
trial <u>de novo</u> must be held in the latter court, the execution of the
aforesaid decision of the City Court (requiring the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
to restore the roofing and remove the fence and/or pay P25.00 compensatory
damages daily to each of the plaintiffs-appellants until the premises are
restored to their former condition) was not yet proper and warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if a case is to be tried <u>de novo</u>,
there is always the possibility that the trial court may make different findings
that will support a judgment contrary to that of the inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the rights of the parties are
changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the inferior court's
decision were to be executed after appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
the Court of First Instance would have to undo what it had previously ordered
to be done; hence, justice would hardly be served if it were mandatory for the
Court of First Instance to order the execution of the City Court's
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, the original
judgment was superseded by that of the Court of First Instance in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Court's decision upon
rendition of the Court of First Instance judgment "becomes a thing of the
past, without life, purpose or effect".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the decision of the Court of First Instance that prevails.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Finally, the city court decision having been superseded, the issue raised now
has become moot and academic and, therefore, cannot be properly raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same reasons hold true as regards the other error assigned in
the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
records reveal that in spite of the fencing and removal of the part of the
roof, plaintiffs were able to continue their respective businesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals in fact found as not
substantiated by competent evidence the claim of plaintiffs-appellants that
their respective gross sales suffered a reduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The books of plaintiff Hernandez showed an
increase in his 1963 gross sales as compared to those of 1962.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the last issue of whether temperate damages may be awarded in
favor of respondent landlord, it has been held that while damages may be
adjudged in forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases, these
"damages" mean "rents" or "the reasonable compensation
for the use and occupation of the premises",<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
or "fair rental value of the property".<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Profits which the plaintiff might have received were it not for the for­cible
entry or <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> do not represent a fair rental
value.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Former Chief Justice Moran makes the following comment as to the
nature of damages that may be recovered in an action for forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"But what is the character of these damages? Since the only
issue in actions for forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> is
physical possession, the damages which plaintiff is entitled to are such as he
may have sustained as a mere possessor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Material possession involves only the enjoyment of the thing possessed,
its uses and the <u>collection of its fruits</u>, and these are the only
benefits which the possessor is deprived of in losing his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, plaintiff is entitled only to
those damages which are caused by his loss of the use and occupation of the
property, and not to such damages as are caused to the land or building during
the unlawful possession, which he may recover only if he were the owner of the
property, and he cannot be declared as such in an action for forcible entry and
<span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Damages to property may be recovered only by the owner in an ordinary
action."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This Court had further occasion to
explain the meaning of "damages" in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases when it said in <span class="SpellE">Mitschiener</span> vs. Barrios, supra,
that -</p>

<blockquote>"Undoubtedly, these pronouncements of the Supreme Court were
taken into consideration by the authors of the Rules of Court when, although in
section 1 of Rule 72<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>,
plaintiff is authorized to sue for the restitution of possession together with
damages,' in drafting section 6 of Rule 72,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
as to judgment to be pronounced, the word 'damages' was eliminated, placing, in
lieu thereof, the words 'reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of
the premises'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 6. <u>Judgment</u>. - If upon trial the court finds that the
complaint is not true, it shall render judgment in favor of the defendant for
the restitution of the premises, for the sum justly due as arrears of rent or
as reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises, and for costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a counterclaim is established, the court
shall render judgment for the sum found in arrears from either party, and award
costs as justice requires.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That is, in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case,
plaintiff may recover either rents or the reasonable compensation for the use
and occupation of the premises, loosely designated in sections 1<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and 8<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
of Rule 72, as 'damages', which may be designated also as 'fair rental value of
the property.' When rents are adjudged no reasonable compensation for the use
and occupation of the property can be adjudicated, while, inversely, when
reasonable compensation is adjudged, it is because no rents are
adjudicated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the more recent case of Ramirez vs. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
Chit<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>,
the aforesaid ruling on the meaning of damages was reiterated when this Court
held that damages recoverable by plaintiff under Section 1, Rule 70 (formerly
Rule 72), are those which correspond to the reason­able value of the use and
occupation of the property, which in this case is the agreed monthly rental of
P230.00 for the land leased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus
considered the award of P25.00 as damages for every day of delay in addition to
the agreed monthly rental as an error and without basis in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the decision is
quoted below:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since temperate damages are neither
"rents" nor "reasonable com­pensation for the use and occupation

We are constrained to deny the temperate damages awarded by the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in view of the plaintiffs-appellants' repeated reneging
on their promises to vacate, and their resorting to litigation to unreasonably
prolong their holding unto the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> property
for eight years, the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is also entitled to
recover in these proceedings attorneys' fees under Article 2208 of the New
Civil Code (Ramirez vs. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Chit, <u>ante</u>), fees
that we fix at P2,500.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this
decision does not preclude respondent from filing in the competent court a
separate suit for damages consisting of other losses allegedly sustained by him
as a result of the wrongful withholding of possession by
petitioners-appellants, especially since this question had been raised in the
city court but were beyond its jurisdiction to award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> <span class="SpellE">Chromite</span> Mining Co. vs. Robles,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
it was ruled by this Court that -</p>

<blockquote>" ……… The Rules expressly provide that upon appeal from the
judgment of a justice of the peace to the court of first instance, the case
shall stand for trial <u>de novo</u> (Section 9, Rule 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This provision has been interpreted to
mean that parties are prevented from raising issues in the court of first

<blockquote>"We must call attention to the fact that the rules, which have
the force of law, provide the manner and occasion when issues are to be raised
for adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the rules were to
be ignored and We permit litigants to raise issues without order and
regulation, confusion would arise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
would certainly happen were we to allow the issues the defendant raised in his
answer in the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant-appellant is not pre­cluded from raising his counterclaims
in a separate action if he decides to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>But in view of the fact that the trial in the Court of First Instance
in an appeal is merely a trial de novo, We are constrained to dismiss the
counterclaims in pursuance of the dictates and mandate of the rules</u>."
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While said damages arose out of, or are necessarily connected
with, the same transaction or occurrence which was the wrongful with­holding of
possession, they are not a compulsory counterclaim because they exceed the
jurisdiction of the inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Calo</span> vs. Ajax International, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
We held that the rule that a compulsory counterclaim is barred if not set up,
when applied to municipal courts presupposes that the amount involved is within
the said court's juris­diction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason for the rule relating to counterclaims is to avoid multiplicity of suits
and to dispose of the whole matter in controversy in one action, and adjustment
of defendant's demand by counterclaim rather than by independent suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
This reason, however, does not obtain where the amount exceeds the jurisdiction
of the inferior court, for, as aptly stated in <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>
vs. Ajax International, Inc., <u>supra</u> -</p>

<blockquote>“ ……… even if the counterclaim in excess of the amount cognizable
by the inferior court is set up, the defendant cannot obtain posi­tive
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rules allow this only for
the de­fendant to prevent plaintiff from recovering from him (Rule 5, Section
5, Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that
should the court find both plaintiff's complaint and defendant's counterclaim
(for the amount exceeding said court's jurisdiction) meritorious, it will
simply dismiss the complaint on the ground that defendant has a bigger
credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since defendant still has to
institute a separate action for the remaining balance of his counter­claim, the
previous litigation did not really settle all related controversies."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the de­cision appealed from is
modified by deleting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the award of temperate
damages, but sentencing plaintiffs-appellants to pay respondent <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span>, Jr., P2,500.
attorney's fees, without prejudice to said respondent's right to file a
