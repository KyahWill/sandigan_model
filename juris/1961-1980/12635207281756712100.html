<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon of <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="10">15 October 1967</st1:date>,

passing by a political meeting being held for his opponent, re-<span class="SpellE">electionist</span> mayor <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
Peralta. The driver of the jeep, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>,
also sustained wounds in the head and on the right arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of this incident, four
persons were charged with murder and frustrated murder before the Court of
First instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte - then municipal mayor
<span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> Peralta, Chief of Police Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>, and Patrolmen Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Arios</span> of the
Marcos police force.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that in the evening of <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="10">13 October 1967</st1:date>, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> was involved in a shooting incident with some
followers of candidate <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>, which became the
subject of a PC investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in
connection with said investigation that <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> and
six of his men went to the PC detachment in <span class="SpellE">Dingras</span>,
riding in a jeep, in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="10">15
 October 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the PC officers
<span style="">had </span>agreed to the necessity
first of an ocular inspection of the place where the incident allegedly took
place, <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> left the area with his men<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and two others - PC Corporal <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> Campos and barrio captain Segundo de la Cruz - <span style="">&nbsp;</span>who had requested for a ride up to barrio <span class="SpellE">Capariaan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> seated himself at the front seat of the <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>-type jeep, between driver <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>
to his left, and Corporal Campos to his right. On the rear side seat behind the
driver were seated Albino <span class="SpellE">Bumanglag</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">Aguidan</span>; <span class="SpellE">Terencio</span> de la Cruz sat
on the spare tire on the floor of the vehicle; and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>, Segundo de la Cruz and Julio <span class="SpellE">Menor</span> sat on the rear side seat behind Corporal Campos.</p>

<p class="BODY">When they reached barrio <span class="SpellE">Alabaan</span>, the
occupants of the jeep saw standing in front of the gate of the yard of Fidel <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> (where a poli­tical meeting was being held), Mayor
Peralta, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> <span style="">and </span>Patrolman Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>,
flagging their jeep to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
slow-moving jeep passed by the trio, Chief <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> and
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> ran after the vehicle and clambered
at the right side thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> took to the side parallel to the front seat occupied
by the driver, <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> and Corporal Campos, while
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> was at the rear side of the vehicle,
his left hand holding on to the steel support of the jeep-top, his feet planted
on the nickel-plated side guards thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The </span>chief of police asked
the driver to stop the vehicle and when he was not heeded, he grabbed the
steering wheel with his left hand.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Then he inquired if the occupants of the vehicle were carrying arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As to
what </span>actually transpired after this point, the declarations of the
alleged eyewitnesses diverge.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the defense, Chief <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>
reached for something under the seat of Corporal Campos and brought out the
barrel of a carbine; that at that instance <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>,
who was sitting at the left of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Campos</span></st1:place></st1:city>
drew a gun and aimed it at the chief of police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seeing his superior in danger, according to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>, he pulled his gun and fired two successive shots at <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>, both of which hit him.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> declared that he alone fired at the deceased<span class="GramE">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>but
that <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> was also able to fire his gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the prosecution witnesses testified that to
the Chief of Police's query whether they were carrying arms Corporal Campos and
<span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> answered in the negative; that immediately
there­after, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>, who was clinging at the
rear right side of the jeep, fired his gun hitting the head of <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>, and when the latter slumped to the right, with
his head resting on the backrest of the seat, <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>
fired at him, hitting <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> on the body.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The victim was already dead when the jeep stopped in front of his own house
about 400 meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also
testified that somebody fired shots at the jeep as it was pulling away from the
scene of the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The necropsy report of the rural health <span class="GramE">physician</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Norberto <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>,

<p class="BODY">On 24 January 1969, the court rendered judgment finding accused
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>
guilty of the crimes charged, and sentencing each of them to life imprisonment,
for the slaying of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>,
and <span style="">to </span>the indeterminate penalty
of 6 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>, as minimum, to 6 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, as maximum, for the wounding
of Norberto <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both accused were also ordered, jointly and severally, to indemnify the
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> in the <span style="">sum </span>of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>, in the sum of P200.00, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> Peralta and <span class="SpellE">Amando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arios</span> were acquitted, there being no evidence estab­lishing
their complicity to the shooting of the victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this decision only <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>
has appealed, assailing the correctness of the decision of the lower court
finding him guilty of the offenses charged and sentencing him accordingly,
allegedly on the basis of the same evidence that acquitted <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
Peralta and <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Arios</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant does not deny that he was with Patrolman Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that fateful afternoon of 15 October 1967 along the road in front of the house
of Fidel <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> (the father of his co-accused Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>); that he flagged down the jeep bearing the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> and eight
others; that he and Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> climbed the
slow-moving vehicle when it passed by them; and that he positioned himself on
the right side of the jeep parallel to the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denies, however, that he fired any gunshot
at all to <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> or anyone inside the jeep, and
this is corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Rosal's</span> admission in court
that he alone fired the two gunshots that caused fatal injuries to <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
disregarding the testimonies of the accused on this point, the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful evaluation of the evidence on record, the
Court believes that the pretension of the defense that Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>, although present, had no participation in the
shooting, is belied by the fact that the fired bullet or slug (Exhibit 'F') found
in the pool of blood on the front floor of the fatal jeep, turned out to have
been fired from <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>' gun (Exhibit 'C'). This is <span class="GramE">a most</span> telling evidence which establish the participation of
<span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
believed that this is the slug that hit <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> at
the back, left armpit, plowed thru his body, and came out of the chest."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Of course, there is insinuation that the fragmented slug (Exhibit
'F') found by the PC investigator <span class="SpellE">Lasaten</span> in the pool
of blood inside the jeep was planted or placed there on purpose by some
interested persons. In the absence of proof, however, that there was tampering
with the evidence, as it is in this case, the presumption that the police
authorities had regularly performed their official duties must be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, there is no doubt that the first shot fired by Jose <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> hit the deceased <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>
at the right mid parietal region (a little above the forehead) penetrating
through and through and coming out at the left <span class="SpellE">occiput</span>
(back portion) of the head above the ear. Since the second bullet that hit him
entered the rear portion of the left forearm (near the armpit), coming out of
the chest, left portion, mid nipple line, and perforating the left lung, this
left to right direction of the bullet indicates that it was fired from a gun at
the rear, left side, of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant insists that this second bullet also came from the gun of Jose
<span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>. It is claimed that when <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>
was hit on the right side of the head, he turned counterclockwise (towards the
left), his head resting on the shoulder of <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>,
the driver, so that when <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> fired the second shot,
the bullet found its mark at the rear portion of <span class="SpellE">Daquioag's</span>
forearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of appellant loses strength in the face of the
following circumstances: first, according to Corporal Campos, when he heard the
first shot he ducked, his lowered head touching the outer part of his thigh.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
With <st1:city><st1:place>Campos</st1:place></st1:city>’ body thus bent forward
and outwardly, there would be nothing that would hold or prop up the body of <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, when
the first shot hit him on the head, the body could have really slumped on the
right side with his head resting on the backrest of the front seat, as
testified to by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this posi­tion, <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> could not have
inflicted the second wound; it would have been caused by a bullet fired from a
gun at the front, right side of the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, as pointed out by the trial judge, the PC investigator found
pools of blood (a) on the floor of the <span class="GramE">jeep,</span> rear,
below the front seat-backrest, and (b) on the floor of the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we follow ap­pellant's theory that the
deceased, on being hit on the head, immediately reeled towards the left and it
was while his head lay on the shoulder of the driver that he was hit the second
time, then why would there be a pool of blood at the back part of the jeep
below the backrest of the front seat? Thirdly, if the wounds sustained by the
deceased were both inflicted by the same person, how can we account for the
presence of powder burns around the second, whereas the first (head) wound was
found to be clean? The only logical conclusion that can be drawn from this fact
is that the gun from whence the first bullet was fired (<span class="SpellE">Rosal's</span>)
was farther than that which fired the bullet that entered the forearm of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As demonstrated by <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> during the trial, when he fired at <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>, the muzzle of his gun was more than 3 feet away
from the latter's body.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Puruganan</span>, the physician who con­ducted the
post-mortem examination of the victim, on the other hand, testified that the
muzzle of the gun from where the first shot was fired must have been more or
less one meter from the head of the deceased,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
thus tallying with <span class="SpellE">Rosal's</span> testimony. But the range
of firing of the gun that inflicted the second wound was only about 18 inches.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Undeniably, <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span>, who was at the side of Corporal
Campos, would be much nearer to <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> when the
latter, slumped to the right side, received the second wound in his body.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, according to <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> himself, he
fired the two shots successively, the difference in time between the first and
the second shot being merely a matter of seconds.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is very unlikely, therefore, that in such split-second <span class="SpellE">Daquioag's</span>
body, by sheer reaction to or impact of the shot, could have turned at the
waist,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
by an angle of no less than 45º, in order that from its original position when
the first bullet plowed through his brain the rear part of his body would be
exposed to the path of the second bullet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is even on the assumption that when the first bullet hit him, <span class="SpellE">Daquioag's</span> back was resting flat against the backrest of
the seat, which is doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that the presence of the Chief of Police, clinging on to the right side of the
jeep and inquiring about firearms, is something unusual if not foretelling of
danger, the normal reaction of an ordinary person would be to turn his body a
little towards that side that engaged his attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a situation like that, it would require a
wider angle than 45º to place <span class="SpellE">Daquioag's</span> body in that
position pictured by ap­pellant when the second shot was fired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another piece of evidence that points to appellant's
participation in the shooting incident of <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="10">15 October 1967</st1:date> is the existence of the wounds of driver <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be recalled that according to the witnesses, when the jeep was flagged
down by the accused, it did not come to a full stop; it merely slowed
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it kept on running until
it reached the front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> about
400 meters away from where the shooting had taken place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, although the driver could
have managed taking quick glances at what was happening inside the vehicle, he
kept his eyes on the road and minded his driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, he sustained two gunshot wounds-one
on the lower third, lateral aspect of the right arm from which the slug,
Exhibit "J", was extracted,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and another, an abrasion on the scalp, right parietal, 1 cm. from the
hairline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true that it was
only <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> who fired his gun inside the jeep, and he
fired at <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> only twice, it is difficult to
explain how <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span> got his wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming for the sake of argument that
the slug that embedded on his right arm had previously passed through the body
of the slain <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>, how did <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>
get grazed on the head? There is no showing that when the deceased was shot in
the head <span class="SpellE">Macatiag's</span> head was in the trajectory line
of that bullet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
there is a bullet hole found by the PC investigator on the canvass-top of the
jeep, located on the left side above the driver's head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a clear indication that somebody
situated on the right side of the driver had also discharged a gun, and it
supports the declarations of the prosecution wit­nesses that Chief <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> took part in the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be true, as appellant <span class="GramE">maintains,</span>
that his purpose in trying to stop the jeep was only to verify a tip that the
occupants thereof were carrying firearms. <span class="GramE">But the legitimacy
of his purpose would not negate his commission subsequently of illegal acts,
nor would such lawful purpose legitimize otherwise unlawful acts.</span> The
fact remains that the evidence on record has sufficiently established that
appellant and <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> almost simultaneously fired their
guns at <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>, resulting in the <span class="GramE">latter's</span>
death and the wounding of driver <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>. Under the
circumstances, it is not even necessary to show that appellant and <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> had previously agreed to carry out the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By their concerted acts of aiming and
actually firing at <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> and/or the occupants of
the jeep, appellant <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>
showed oneness of purpose and unity in the execution of the criminal act,
thereby making them co-conspirators in its accomplishment,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
equally liable for all the consequences thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
it being immaterial who actually fired the fatal shot.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We also agree with the lower court that the crimes committed were
murder and frustrated murder, the shooting having been charac­terized by
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the accounts of witnesses,
it appears clear that the firing of the guns was simultaneous and sudden, just
immediately after the chief of police had asked whether they were carrying
firearms, that the occupants of the jeep could not have ex­pected that said
peace officers would open fire on them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> and his companions must have
been completely taken by surprise by <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rosal</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span>
not even one of those in the jeep had the sense, or the opportunity, to jump
out of the vehicle to avoid getting caught in the crossfire.</p>

<p class="BODY">To show that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> was
not totally unaware of what was coming to him, the defense tried to make
capital of the fact that Corporal Campos found on the floor of the jeep at the
front a .22 caliber revolver said to belong to the slain man. Appellant and <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> then testified that when the former discovered the barrel
of a carbine from under the seat where Corporal Campos was sitting, <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span> pulled out a gun and pointed it to the chief of
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This version, however, was
vehemently denied by Corporal Campos, a totally disinterested person who
happened to be an eyewitness to the incident, and <span class="GramE">We</span>
are not prepared to overrule the trial judge in giving more credence to the
testimony of this witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no
error, therefore, in the ruling <span style="">of the
lower court declaring appellant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pillos</span> guilty
of the crimes of murder and frustrated murder, and in sentencing him to life
imprisonment and to the indeterminate penalty of from 6 months </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>, as minimum, to 6 years and 1 day
of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">mayor</span></u><span style="">, as maximum, for
the slaying of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquioag</span>
and the wounding of Norberto <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span>, respectively;
to indemnify <span class="SpellE">Macatiag</span> and the heirs of the deceased;
and to pay one-fourth of the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
