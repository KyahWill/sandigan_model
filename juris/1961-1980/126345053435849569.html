				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc., as owner
and/or operator of the sugar cane plantations known as Haciendas Esperanza, <span class="SpellE">Najalin</span>, Consuelo, <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caiñaman</span>, filed the present petition, praying for the
review and reversal of the orders of the Court of Agrarian Relations (in its
Case No. L-216, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>), dated <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1964</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1964</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1964</st1:date>,
the Associated Labor Union (ALU) petitioned the Court of Agrarian Relations in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(No. L?216) for the holding of a certification election among all the
agricultural workers in the five sugar cane plantations owned and/or operated
by <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc., in the district of La
Carlota, Occidental <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>, to enable them to select
their exclusive bar­gaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It proposed the selection of only one bargaining agent for all the
workers, permanent and seasonal alike, in the five <u>haciendas</u> (Esperanza,
<span class="SpellE">Najalin</span>, Consuelo, <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Caiñaman</span>) <span style="">to</span>
which<span style=""> proposal </span>the management
did not disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU) and the
Commercial, Agricultural and Industrial Labor Organization (CAILO), however,
intervened, praying that separate certification elections be conducted in each
of the five sugar cane plantations, and that one bargaining unit be designated
for the permanent workers and another for the seasonal workers or <span class="SpellE"><u>sacadas</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the hearing, during which the parties entered into certain
stipulations of fact, the court issued an order, dated August 20, 1964,
directing the conducting of separate certification elections - one for
permanent workers and one for seasonal workers - in each of the five planta­tions,
reasoning that the arrangement would promote the best interests of the workers
in each <u>hacienda</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling was
based on the court's finding that although the <u>haciendas</u> are owned
and/or operated by <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc., they are
administered separately by different individuals; that each of the plantations
is big enough to be considered an employer unit; and that, the petitioner union
(ALU) counts memberships among all the employees of the five planta­tions; the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">intervenor</span></span> PAFLU, among the
permanent employees of three plantations, while <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
CAILO has members only among the permanent workers of one plantation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not appear when the management received notice of this
order, which is dated <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1964</st1:date>,
but the records show that <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> filed a motion for its reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1964</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
complaining that to require it to deal with ten small units virtually amounts
to harassment of the manage­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
motion was denied on <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="9">September 12,
 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also appears on
record that in compliance with the August 20, 1964 - order of the Court,
certification elections were conducted by the Department of Labor on November
16, 18, 23, 24 and 25, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
following the results of these elections, the Agrarian Court, on January 11,
1965 issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
certifying PAFLU as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of the
permanent workers in <u>Haciendas</u> Esperanza, <span class="SpellE">Najalin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span>, while the Associated Labor Union<span style=""> </span>was certified as the bargaining agent
of the temporary or seasonal workers in the same <u>haciendas</u> Esperanza, <span class="SpellE">Najalin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span>, as well as
of all the workers (permanent and seasonal) in <u>hacienda</u> Consuelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No representative was certified far the <span style="">workers in </span><u>hacienda</u> <span class="SpellE">Caiñaman</span>, who returned "no-union" votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Elizalde</span> &amp; Co., Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> filed the present petition in this Court for the purpose
already stated at the beginning of this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner is taking an appeal from the orders of the
Agrarian Court of August 20, 1964, holding that there should be separate <span style="">bargaining </span>units for permanent workers
and seasonal workers, in each of the five sugar cane plantations; <span style="">from </span>the order of September 12, 1964,
denying its motion for reconsideration; and from the order of January 11, 1965,
certifying the unions voted for in the certification elections conducted by the
Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Revised Rules of Court, any party may appeal from a
final order, ruling or decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations by filing
with said tribunal a notice of appeal and with this Court, the required number
of petition for review or certiorari, within <u>15 days</u> (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 1 and 4, Rule 43) from receipt of the order, ruling
or decision <span style="">being </span>contested.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption that the first two orders have become <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for lack of timely appeal is rendered conclusive,
not only by the holding of the certification elections on November 16, 18, 23,
24 and 25, 1964, but also by petitioner's failure to state in the petition that
the appeal from the aforesaid orders is made within the period.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The appeal from the orders of <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1964</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="9">September 12,
 1964</st1:date>, therefore, must be ruled out for being out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the appeal fruit the order of <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1965</st1:date> must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, having been notified of this
order on <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1965</st1:date>,
the filing of the petition in this Court on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1965</st1:date>, was clearly beyond the 15-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming that the correctness and legality of the orders
of November 1964 and <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1965</st1:date>
could still be properly entertained by this Court, there is nothing in the
allegations of the petition that would justify reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well to reiterate, in this connection,
that the determination of what constitutes a proper bargaining unit, like any
other phase of certification proceedings, lies primarily in the discretion of
the trial Court, since no individual factor is given by law decisive weight,
and we see nothing that indicates arbitrariness or abuse of discretion by the
Court below.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Further, that each <u>Hacienda</u> has its separate administrator strongly
supports the orders complained of, as labor conflicts due to manage­ment
practices in one plantation will not necessarily involve the others.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's claim of nullity of the certification-order of <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1965</st1:date> is further weakened
in that it is premised on its main proposition that the designation of separate
bargaining units for the workers in the five sugar cane plantations is not
supported by law and existing jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the issue of the constitution of appropriate bargaining units for the
workers can no longer be passed upon, the same having been barred by
prescriptive limitations, besides being conformable to law and jurisprudence,
the attack against the certification-order necessarily must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed, without
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><b>SO ORDERED.</b></span></p>
