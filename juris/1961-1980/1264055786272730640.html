<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal from the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> 
Occidental direct to this Court on a question of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioners, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and others filed in the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental a petition for certiorari against 
the respondents <span class="SpellE">Tertulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> and Manuel H. <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span>, 
Justice of the Peace of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bago</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Briefly the facts are as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 14, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
barrio elections were held in Barrio Lag-<span class="SpellE">asan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Negros</span></span> Occidental. Cesar Alvarez was proclaimed 
elected barrio lieutenant together with others who were elected in various 
positions in the barrio assembly. On </span><st1:date month="1" day="18" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 18, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
<span class="SpellE">Tertulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> filed a 
protest before the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, naming Ramon <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> Garcia and 
<span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Toledo as <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>. <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> however failed to 
allege in his protest that he was voted for any office in the barrio elections, 
and he also failed to include the name of Cesar Alvarez who was the duly 
proclaimed elected barrio lieu tenant. On </span><st1:date month="3" day="7" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 7, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
protest was called for hearing by the respondent Justice of the Peace. The <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>, thru counsel, moved for the dismissal of the 
protest on the ground that the Justice of the Peace had no jurisdiction to hear 
the case. The protestant asked for leave to file an answer to the motion to 
dismiss, but instead of filing an answer he filed a motion for leave to admit 
his amended election protest which included Cesar Alvarez as <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>. At first the respondent Justice of the Peace 
denied the admission of the amended election protest but he later reconsidered 
his order and admitted the amended election protest. In the amended election 
protest, Cesar Alvarez, along with the original <span class="SpellE">protestees</span> Ramon <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> 
Toledo and other members of the barrio assembly were included. It appears, 
however, that when the amended election protest was admitted by the respondent 
Justice of the Peace more than two weeks had elapsed since the proclamation of 
the elected barrio lieutenant and members of the barrio council who were 
included as <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>. Having failed to obtain the 
reconsideration by the respondent Justice of the Peace of his order admitting 
the amended election protest, the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span> 
(petitioners herein filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental a petition for certiorari. Two grounds 
were alleged in the petition for certiorari, namely:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the original election 
protest did not allege that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tertulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bico</span> was a candidate who was duly voted for the position of 
barrio lieutenant; and<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span></span></span><span dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That the amended election protest 
which included Cesar Alvarez as <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, whose name 
was not mentioned in the original protest, was filed outside the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of two weeks from the date of the 
proclamation of said <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, as provided in Sec. 
174 of the Revised Election Code.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Issues were joined in the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental and, after 
<span class="GramE">hearing,</span> the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental rendered a decision finding that the 
petition for certiorari was without merit and thereby dismissed the same. <span class="GramE">Hence this appeal of the petitioners from that decision of the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> 
Occidental.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find, however, that the matter 
to be decided in the present case refers to officers of the barrio assembly of 
Barrio Lag-<span class="SpellE">asan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, who were proclaimed elected on January 
14, 1962, as to whether they were legally elected or not Under Republic Act 237A 
otherwise known as Barrio Charter, the term of office of the barrio lieutenant 
and members of the barrio council is only for a period of two years. It follows, 
therefore that the term of office of those that were elected in the barrio 
elections of </span><st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 14, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> has 
already expired. As a matter of fact, <span class="GramE">another barrio 
elections</span> were held throughout the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> on </span><st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 12, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. We 
consider, therefore, that the question to be decided in the present case has 
become academic, so that this case has become moot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the present case is dismissed, 
without costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
