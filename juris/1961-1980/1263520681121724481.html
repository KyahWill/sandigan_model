<p class="BODY">In dismissing the complaint against Victoria <span class="SpellE">Bangkili</span>
the trial court held that under Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code Victoria <span class="SpellE">Bangkili</span> could not be held civilly liable for the criminal
act of her minor son, who was already 19 years of age at the time he committed
the offense; and that Article 2180 of the New Civil Code was not applicable for
it covers only obligations arising from quasi-<span class="SpellE">delicts</span>
and not to those arising from crimes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiffs moved to reconsider the dismissal of the complaint as
against defendant Victoria <span class="SpellE">Bangkili</span>, and upon denial
of the motion instituted the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment as against Carlos <span class="SpellE">Bangkili</span>
is not now questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of the
parties has appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liability of the said defendant is
therefore a closed matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
issue upon which both the appellants and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
have submitted this case is whether or not the latter, as the mother of Carlos
who had him in her custody at the time he committed the offense, should be
adjudged liable with him for the amount which he was sentenced to pay,
considering that he was then a minor of 19 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is not of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been resolved in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Exconde</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span>, 101 Phil.
843; <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Arreglado</span>,

748.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this last-mentioned case
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Balce</span>, father of <span class="SpellE">Gumersindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balce</span>, a minor of less than 18 years who was living
with him, was sued on his subsidiary liability for the civil indemnity adjudged
in the criminal case for homicide wherein <span class="SpellE">Gumersindo</span>
had been found guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
dismissed the case, stating that the subsidiary civil liability of the
defendant must be determined under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code,
and not under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing the decision this Court, thru
Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo, held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that under Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code,
a father is made civilly liable for the acts committed by his son only if the
latter is an imbecile, an insane, under 9 years of age, or over 9 but under 15
years of age, who acts without discernment, unless it appears that there is no
fault or negligence on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
because a son who commits the act under any of those conditions is by law
exempt from criminal liability (Article 12, subdivisions 1, 2 and 3, Revised
Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea is not to leave
the act entirely unpunished but to attach certain civil liability to the person
who has the delinquent minor under his legal authority or control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a minor over 15 who acts with discernment
is not exempt from criminal liability, for which reason the Code is silent as
to the subsidiary liability of his parents should he stand convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, resort should be had to the
general law which is our Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The particular law that governs this case is Article 2180, the pertinent
portion of which provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="GramE">The</span> father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the
mother, are responsible for damages caused by the minor children who live in
their company.' To hold that this provision does not apply to the instant case
because it only covers obligations which arise from quasi-<span class="SpellE">delicts</span>
and not obligations which arise from criminal offenses, would result in the
absurdity that while for an act where mere negligence intervenes the father or
mother may stand <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable for the damage
caused by his or her son, no liability would attach if the <span class="GramE">damage</span>
is caused with criminal intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily,
the void that apparently exists in the Revised Penal Code is <span class="SpellE">subserved</span> by this particular provision of our Civil Code,
as may be gleaned from some recent decisions of this Court which cover equal or
identical cases."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the decision just cited referred to the subsidiary
liability of the father whose son had been sentenced to pay civil indemnity in
the criminal case, the reasons given by this Court in applying Article 2180 of
the Civil Code hold true with greater cogency in this case, where the
allegations in the complaint show that herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was sued directly under the said provision, in that she "failed and
neglected to exercise the proper care and vigilance over her ward and minor
child and as a consequence of such failure and neglect, the said Carlos <span class="SpellE">Bangkili</span> committed the wrongful act herein complained
of." Even more to the point is the case of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Arreglado</span>, <i>supra</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There the minor Dario <span class="SpellE">Arreglado</span>
entered a plea of guilty on a charge of frustrated homicide, but the court
suspended proceedings pursuant to Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code in view
of the fact that he was only 14 years of age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A civil suit was thereafter filed by the offended party against the said
accused and his parents for the recovery of damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling of the lower court holding the
said parents liable was affirmed, although with some modification as to the
amount awarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> here agrees that Article
2180 is applicable in this case, but submits that its applica­tion should be
relaxed, considering that her son, al­though living with her, was already 19
years of age and hence mature enough to have a mind of his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact is not a legal defense, however,
and does not exempt the appellant from her responsibility as parent and natural
guardian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 2180 does not provide
for any exemption except proof that the defendant parent "observed all the
diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage." There is no
such proof in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the judgment appealed from is reversed with
respect to defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Victoria <span class="SpellE">Bangkili</span>, and she is hereby adjudged liable <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> with her co-defendant for the amounts awarded in
said judgment, with costs.</p>
