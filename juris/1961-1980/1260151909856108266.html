				G.R. No. L-20814, November 29, 1966</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. CARMEN DY ALIAS DY GIOK KHA, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><div align="justify"><br><p>Appeal by the Solicitor General from a decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Misamis Occidental granting the petition for naturalization, as 
citizen of the Philippines, of appellee Carmen Dy. Upon a review of the record, 
we are satisfied that said petition should be dismissed, for: </p>
<ol><li>Petitioner has no lucrative occupation, it being alleged in her petition 
that her income is P2,400 a year, or P200 a month, which is far from being 
"lucrative" within the purview of the Naturalization Law, considering that she 
has six (6) children, five (5) of them dependent upon her and of school age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In fact, her gross receipts in 1959 
amounted to P1,713.16 only.<br><br>
</li><li>In her declaration of intention, as well as in her petition herein, 
petitioner stated that her name is Carmen Dy <i>alias</i> Dy Giok Kha; but her 
birth certificate, dated May 13 , 1924, shows that she was born and baptized 
with the name Carmen Dy. This is confirmed by her alien certificate of 
registration dated November 28, 1945. However, her immigration certificate of 
residence, issued in 1951, shows that she then began to use the "<i>alias </i>Dy 
Giok Kha". It is not disputed that petitioner had secured no previous judicial 
authority for the use of said alias. In other words, she has violated the 
Anti-Alias-Law, which is sufficient groundto deny her application for 
naturalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]<br><br></sup>
</li><li>Petitioner has not evinced a sincere desire to embrace the customs and 
traditions of the Filipinos, she having enrolled everyone of her six (6) 
children in Chinese schools. Although, after the filing of her petition for 
naturalization, petitioner transferred two (2) of them to a Catholic school, 
this circumstance—apart from having been obviously influenced by the present 
proceedings—does not detract from the fact that her behavior, at the time of the 
commencement thereof and prior thereto, showed a lack of earnest intention to 
identify herself and her children with the Filipino community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </li></ol>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby 
reversed, and the petition for naturalization herein dismissed, with costs 
against petitioner Carmen Dy.</p>
<p><strong>IT IS SO ORDERED.</strong></p><em>Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Regala, 
Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez</em> and <em>Ruiz Castro, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Dizon, J.,</em> took no part.<br><br><br>
