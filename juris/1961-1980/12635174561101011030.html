				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Begosa</span>, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, sought the
aid of the judiciary to obtain the benefits to which he believed he was
entitled under the Veterans' Bill of Rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
To such a move, there was an insistent objection, both vigorous and persistent,
on the part of defendants, the chairman and the members of the Philippine
Veterans Administration, now appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court, then presided by the then Judge, now Justice of the
Court of Appeals, the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, found for plaintiffs, after a careful and
meticulous study of the applicable statutory provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being satisfied with such a judgment,
defendants appealed, relying once more on the principal grounds raised below
that plaintiff should have exhausted his administrative remedies before coming
to court and that he was in fact suing the State without its consent having
been obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As neither defense is
sufficiently meritorious, we affirm the lower court decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in such decision, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
complaint was predicated on his having been "an enlisted man in good
standing of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, inducted in the service of the
USAFFE" and having taken "active participation in the battle of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>" as well as the "liberation drive against
the enemy" thereafter having become "permanent­ly incapacitated from
work due to injuries he sustained in line of duty * * *.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was likewise asserted in his complaint that after having submitted all the
supporting papers relative to his complaint, there was a disapproval on the
part of defendants on the ground of his having been dishonorably dis­charged,
although such an event did not take place until almost five years after the end
of the war on November 7, 1950 and while he was in the service of a different
organization that such a penalty was imposed on him.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the allegation that there was an approval on his claim
on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1964</st1:date> but
effective only as of October 5 of that year, and for amounts much less than
that to which he was entitled under the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relief sought was the payment, as of the
date to which he believed his right to pension should have been respected, of
the sums, which he felt were legally due and owing to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The then Judge <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> noted that there
was an admission of certain allegations to the complaint with others being
denied, and that the following affirmative and special defenses were
interposed: "Defendants' answer admits certain allegations of said
complaint, while denying others; sets up the following affirmative and special
defenses: (1) payment of disability pension under Republic Act No. 65, as
amended, by the Philip­pine Veterans Administration commences from the date the
proper application <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is approved; (2)
plaintiff has not exhausted all administrative remedies before resorting to
court action, hence the present action is premature; (3) inasmuch as the
instant action pertains to money claim against the Government, it must first be
presented before the Auditor General as provided by existing law on the matter (C.
A. 327); and (4) plaintiff's claim is in reality a suit against the Government
which cannot be entertained by this Court for lack of jurisdiction because the
Government has not given its consent, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The case was then submitted on an agreed statement of facts and the respective
memoranda of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the decision now on appeal, the question of when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is entitled to his pension as well as how much it
would amount to were fully discussed by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as to the former: "From the facts
just set out, it will be noted that plaintiff filed his said claim for
disability pension as far back as March 4, 1955; that it was erroneously
disapproved on June 21, 1955, because his dishonorable discharge from the Army
was not a good or proper ground for the said disapproval, and that on
reconsideration asked for by him on November 1, 1957, which he continued to
follow up, the Board of Administrators, Philippine Veterans Administration,
composed of herein defendants, which took over the duties of the Philippine
Veterans Board, finally approved his claim on September 2, 1964, at the rate of
P30.00 a month."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
After stating that in fairness and good conscience the said claims could be
made effective as of June 21, 1955, when it was erroneously disapproved by
appellants, and not on September 2, 1964 when it was approved on
reconsideration, as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should not for obvious
reason be made to suffer for the error of another, the then Judge <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> observed further: "Had it not been for the
said error, it appears that there was no good ground to deny the said claim, so
the latter was valid and meritorious even as of the date of its filing on March
4, 1955, hence to make the same effective only as of the date of its approval
on September 2, 1964 - according to defendant's stand - would be greatly unfair
and prejudicial to plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
especially true in the light of the well-known intent of the legislature in
passing these pension laws of war veterans, and the no less well-known spirit
in which they should be construed or interpreted by the courts in favor of
their beneficiaries."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of how much plaintiff should receive according to
law, the appealed decision contains the following: "The next question for
resolution refers to the monthly rate or amount to which plaintiff is entitled
by way of pension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
plaintiff, he should be given a disability pension of P50.00 a month from June
21, 1955 (the effective date of his claim as above found by this Court) until
June 21, 1957, and P100.00 a month for life from June 22, 1957 (when Section 9
of Republic Act No. 65, as amended by Republic Act No. 1362, was further
amended by Republic Act No. 1920).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention, is well taken because the very letter of the Philippine Veterans
Administration to plaintiff (Annex F of the [Agreed Statement of Facts])
contains the following 'Note: Re-rating is not required, permanent disability.'
By 'Permanent disability', as this Court understands it, is meant that
plaintiff is permanently incapacitated from work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 9 of Republic Act No. 65, as
amended by Republic Act No. 1362, which was the law in force when plaintiff's
claim for pension should have been approved on June 21, 1955, he was entitled to
a pension of P50.00 a month as such permanently incapacitated person, which
monthly rate or amount was increased to P100. 00 a month when the said Section
9 was further amended by Republic Act No. 1920 on June 22, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Why the action of appellants in the form of resolution could not prevail as
against the law was made clear by the decision in this wise: "For one
thing, the said resolution may not change or amend the meaning of the term
'permanent disability' as used by Congress itself in enacting the said Section
9 of Republic Act No. 65, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For another, as of June 21, 1955 and as of June 21, 1957, plaintiff was
already entitled to the said pension of P50.00 and P100.00 a month
respectively, and his said right cannot be adversely affected by a resolution
which was allegedly adopted only in 1963."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Necessarily, there was in the decision likewise a recognition of the monthly
allowance for each of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> unmarried minor,
children below 18 years of age at the time he was entitled to the pension to
which under the statute he could validly lay claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">After rejecting as untenable the defenses that there was no
exhaustion of administrative remedies, that the action is in the nature of
money claim which should first be presented before the Auditor General, and
that said action is in reality a suit against the Government without the
latter's consent, the decision concludes with the following: "[Wherefore],
judgment is; hereby rendered in accordance with the prayer of plaintiff's
amended complaint, to wit, that defendants make plaintiff's pension effective
June 21, 1955 at the rate of P50.00 a month up to June 21, 1957 at the rate of
P100.00 a month, plus P10. 00 a month each for his four unmarried minor
children below 18 years old from June 22, 1957 up to September 1, 1964; and the
difference of P70. 00 a month, plus P10.00 for his one unmarried minor child
below 18 years old from September 2, 1954, and thereafter, with costs against
said defendants."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants elevated the matter to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The careful and painstaking way in which the
controlling statutory provisions were considered and applied by the then Judge <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> must have impelled them to place their faith in the
alleged failure to respect the doctrines of non-suability and exhaustion of
administrative remedies to obtain a reversal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appealed decision, however, as will now be shown, is not subject to
such a reproach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal then, as
noted at the outset, is not to be attended with success.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">The fourth assignment of error
assails what it considers to be the failing of the lower court in not holding
that the complaint in this case is in effect a suit against the State which has
not given its consent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
recently had occasion to reaffirm the force and primacy of the doctrine of non-suability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not admit of doubt, then, that if the suit were in fact against the
State, the lower court should have dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is it to be doubted that while ostensibly
an action may be against a public official, the defendant may in reality be the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, it is equally
well-settled that where a litigation may have adverse consequences on the
public treasury, whether in the disbursements of funds or loss of property, the
public official proceeded against not being liable in his personal capacity, then
the doctrine of non-suability may appropriately be invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no application, however, where the
suit against such a functionary had to be instituted because of his failure to
comply with the duty imposed by statute appropriating public funds for the
benefit of plaintiff or petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
is the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine announced by us in Ruiz v. <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
finds relevance: ”We hold that under the facts and circum­stances alleged in
the amended complaint, which should be taken on its face value, the suit is not
one against the Government, or a claim against it, but one against the
officials to compel them to act in accordance with the rights to be established
by the contending architects, or to prevent them from making payment and
recognition until the contending architects have established their respective
rights and interests, in the funds retained and in the credit for the work
done."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, in an earlier case where we sustained the power of a
private citizen claiming title to and right of possession of a certain property
to sue an officer or agent of the government alleged to be illegally
withholding the same, we likewise expressed this <u>caveat</u>: "However,
and this is important, where the judgment in such a case would result not only
in the recovery of possession of the property in favor of said citizen but also
in a charge against or financial liability to the Government, then the suit
should be regarded as one against the government itself, and, consequently, it
cannot prosper or be validly entertained by the courts except with the consent
of said Government."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Nor is the third assignment of
error to the effect that the lower court did not require <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to exhaust his administrative remedies before coming to court any more persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An excerpt from the leading case of Gonzales
v. <span class="SpellE">Hechnova</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by the present Chief Justice, clearly demonstrates why
appellants' argument in this respect is unavailing: "Respondents assail
petitioner's right to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for because
he 'has not exhausted all administrative remedies available to him before
coming to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already held,
however, that the principle requiring the previous exhaustion of administrative
remedies is not applicable 'where the question in dispute is purely a legal
one', or where the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> act is 'patently
illegal' or was performed without jurisdiction or in excess of juris­diction,
or where the respondent is a department secretary, whose acts as an alter ego
of the President bear the implied or assumed approval of the latter, unless
actually disapproved by him, or where there are circumstances indicating the
urgency of judicial intervention."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The Gonzales doctrine, it is to be noted, summarized the views announced in
earlier cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The list of subsequent cases reiterating such a doctrine is quite impressive.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
To be more specific, where there is a stipulation of facts, as in this case,
the question before the lower court being solely one of law and on the face of
the decision, the actuation of appellants being' patently illegal, the doctrine
of exhaustion of administrative remedies certainly does not come into play.</p>

the alleged failure of the lower court to comply with the law in-fixing the

has often been announced, and rightly so, that as much as possible the findings
of these regulatory agencies which are expected to acquire expertise by their
jurisdiction being confined to specific matters, deserve to be accorded respect
and finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a limit, however,
to such a deference paid to the actuations of such bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, where there has been a failure to
interpret and apply the statutory provisions in question, judicial power should
assert itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the theory of

the final say on questions of law in appropriate cases coming before it is
vested.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the then Judge <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, therefore,
as he was called upon to do, saw to it that there was strict compliance with
the amounts of pension required by the law to be granted plaintiff and

appellants, the effect of which would make <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
suffer the consequences of an error committed by them, it cannot be truly said
