				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> imposing upon the defendant Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>reclusión</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and upon defendant Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>, alias Jose <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>, <span class="GramE">an</span> indeterminate sentence of from 12 years and 1 day to 17
years, <span style="">4 months </span>and 1 day.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17"><span style="">5:00 o'</span>clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1963</st1:date>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>
was working in his <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> in <u>Barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Lipata</span>, Allen, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Samar</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The brothers Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> and Felipe <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Mongaya</span></span> who, due to previous
incidents, harbored ill-feelings towards Angel Garcia, <span style="">Sr., and his </span>family, came passing by and asked <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Briones</span></span><span style=""> if he </span>had seen Santos Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Briones</span> asked why
they were <span style="">looking for </span>Santos
Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Socorro replied "If only I
will see him now, it will not last up to tomorrow morning, we will kill
him." <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> followed the two brothers to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> of <u>Barrio </u><span class="SpellE">Lipata</span>
with the intention of warning Angel <span style="">Gar</span>cia,
Jr., elder brother of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After crossing the bridge, <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> stopped <span style="">by </span>the
house of his son, Jesus, where he drank a glass of water and played for a short
time with his grandson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before he
went up the house of his son, he saw the <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>
brothers some distance from the bridge standing and looking around. </p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock P.M.</st1:time>,
he (<span class="SpellE">Briones</span>) went down the house of his son to <span style="">go </span>to the house of Angel Garcia, Jr.,
which was about one hundred meters further ahead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he reached the house of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pollente</span>, he heard someone groaning near a hill planted to
bananas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he cast his eyes in that
direction he saw Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> Stabbing with a
long-pointed weapon the chest of Santos Garcia while Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>
held the latter fast by the left arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, seized with fear, scampered away towards the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>, and his home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While running he looked back and saw Santo staggering towards the house
of his brother, Angel, pursued by the two <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>
brothers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Angel was in his house at the time and heard his brother <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
utter, "I was stabbed by Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> and
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beaming his flashlight on the stairs, he saw his brother bathed in <span style="">blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>A short time later, <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pornelos</span></span><span style="">, </span>step-father of the <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> <span style="">brothers,
arrived, went up </span>the <span style="">house and
told Angel </span><span style="">Gar­cia, </span><span style="">Jr., "You better not go out any more </span>with
your family so that <span style="">your life and the
lives of the members of your family will not be in danger".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After delivering </span>the warn­ing, he
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also caught in the beam of <span style="">Angel's </span>flashlight were Socorro, who
was holding a blood-stained, long-pointed weapon, and Felipe, both standing on
the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also left immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> </p>

<p class="BODY">At about the same time, Jose <span class="SpellE">Macabare</span>,
barrio Lieutenant of <span class="SpellE">Lipata</span>, <span style="">was resting in </span>his house, when <span class="SpellE">Pornelos</span>
arrived and informed him that <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
had met with a mishap, namely, that he had been stabbed by his step-sons,
Socorro and Felipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macabare</span>
told <span class="SpellE">Pornelos</span> to go ahead to Angel Garcia's house and
he would follow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macabare</span>
went to Angel's house and on seeing Santos Garcia lying in a prone position
with his abdomen <span class="GramE">bleeding,</span> he placed his hand on <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>'
right shoulder and asked who wounded him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> replied that Socorro
wounded him while Felipe held him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
hearing this declaration, <span class="SpellE">Macabare</span> told Angel to put
it in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angel did so, and <span class="SpellE">Macabare</span> held the thumb of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and placed the imprint of the latter's thumb on the declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Macabare</span> then
affixed his sig­nature on the declaration as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> was then
placed on a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Allen</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he died.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy report shows that six stab wounds were inflicted on
the chest and abdomen of Santos Garcia, and that his death was caused by severe
hemorrhage due to the stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, without giving legal reasons, found the two
defendants guilty of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first point for
determination, not discussed in the lower court's decision, is whether there
was conspiracy between the two brothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The point is a vital one because without conspiracy, the liability of
the defendants would not be that of principals, but individual, that </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">each defendant would be liable only for his own acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy means previous concert of criminal
design or participation in the same criminal intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that at about five </span><span style="">o'clock </span><span style="">in the afternoon, when the two <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>
brothers, who had been looking for Santos Garcia, came passing by the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> being tilled by Juan <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>,
Socorro asked the latter </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">he
had seen Santos Garcia; that when asked why they were looking for Santos
Garcia, </span><span style="">Socorro </span><span style="">replied: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>“If only I will see him now, it will not last
up to tomorrow morning, we will kill him"; that the two brothers then
continued walking in the direc</span><span style="">tion
of </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>,
Juan <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> following them at a distance with the
intention of going to the house of Angel Garcia, Jr. (Santos' elder brother),
to inform him of the plan of the <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> brothers to
kill Santos; that on the way, Juan <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> stopped
for a while at the house of his way, son in order to drink a glass of water and
to play with his grandson; that he saw at a distance the <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>
brothers near the bridge and they appeared to be waiting for </span><span style="">some­one; </span><span style="">that at about six o'clock in the same afternoon he resumed walking
towards the house of Angel Garcia, </span><span style="">Jr.;
</span><span style="">that when he reached the house
of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pollente</span>, he heard someone groaning near
a hill planted to bananas; that casting his eyes in that direction he saw
Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> stabbing Santos Garcia with a
sharp-pointed weapon at the chest, while Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>
held Santos Garcia fast by the left arm; that seized with fear he scampered
away towards the <span class="SpellE">ricefleld</span> and his home; that while
running, he looked back and saw Santos Garcia staggering towards his elder
brother's house pursued by </span><span style="">Socorro
</span><span style="">and Felipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts and circumstances clearly show
that there was previous concert of criminal design or participation in the same
criminal intent, which was conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the concerted acts performed by the defendants clearly
show their individual, direct participation in the execution of the crime,
which they had agreed to commit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second question for
resolution, on which the trial court made no finding, is whether there was
evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts
above-stated clearly show that the defendants had, under the circumstances,
sufficient time for full meditation and reflection; hence, there was evident
premeditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court's finding
that there was treachery is correct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> stabbed Santos Garcia
from in front, said victim could not defend him­self because he was held fast
by his left arm by Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span> and because he had
no weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The killing was committed in
such form and manner that there was no risk to the corporal integrity or the
lives of the killers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Reviewing the case for the appellants, we find that their defense
of <u>alibi</u> is not worthy of serious considera­tion; that it is unnecessary
to resolve their contention that it was error for the lower court to admit in
evidence the alleged dying declaration of Santos Garcia, for the reason that
the testimonies of Juan <span class="SpellE">Briones</span>, Angel Garcia, Jr.,
and the Barrio lieutenant, Jose <span class="SpellE">Macabare</span>,
sufficiently proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of said appellants; that
the circumstances pointed out by appellants' counsel <span style="">to cast doubt upon the credibility of the said witnesses for the
prosecution are not of sufficient weight or importance to disturb the findings
of the trial court which found them and their testimonies worthy of credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The qualifying circumstance of treachery having elevated the
killing of murder, the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation should
be taken into account only as a generic aggravating circumstance calling for
the imposition of the penalty for murder in its maximum period, which is
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The death penalty should,
technically, be imposed upon appellant Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>,
but for lack of the necessary votes for <span style="">the imposition </span>of this penalty, considering
that said appellant was only 18 years old at the time of the commission of the
murder, he should be given the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">reclusión</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the other appellant,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>, considering that he was only 17 years
old when the murder was committed, a privileged mitigating circumstance under
Article <span style="">68 </span>(2) of the Revised
Penal Code, he should be given the penalty one degree lower than the applicable
penalty and in relation to the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The award of P6,000 as compensatory damages to the heirs of
Santos Garcia should be modified and raised to P12,000 (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, <span class="SpellE">G.R.No</span>. L-18793,
promulgated <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1968</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b><span style="">,
</span>the appealed judgment is hereby affirmed with respect to the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>reclusi</u><u><span style="">ó</span>n</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> imposed upon Socorro <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">appealed</span> <span style="">judgment </span>is, however, modified with respect to the penalty
imposed upon Felipe <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>, alias Jose <span class="SpellE">Mongaya</span>, who is hereby given an indeterminate sentence of
from 10 years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prisi</u><u><span style="">ó</span>n</u></span> <u><span style="">mayor</span></u>
