				<H3>MIGUEL P. ARRIETA, PETITIONER, VS. HONORIO BELLOS, AS DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF NEGROS ORIENTAL, AND SERAFIN L. TEVES, AS GOVERNOR OF NEGROS ORIENTAL, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Review of the decision of the Court of Appeals approving the dismissal of 
petitioner's action of <em>quo warranto.</em> Said court found that in April 
1952, Miguel P. Arrieta, was appointed by then Governor Pedro A. Bandoquillo of 
Negros Oriental, as deputy governor of said province. He served as such up to 
January 3, 195C, when he obtained from Serafm L. Teves, then the newly elected 
Governor, leave of absence for 103 days. Simultaneously with his leave 
application, Arrieta asked for permission—which was granted—to transfer to 
another branch of the government service within the province.</p>
<p>It appears that on January 1, 1956, Teves appointed Honorio Bellos deputy 
governor of the province vice Miguel Arrieta. On January 11, 1956, eight days 
after Arrieta had applied for leave, Governor Teves <em>advised him in 
writing</em> that his leave application was approved on condition that, upon 
expiration thereof, Arrieta's services would be considered terminated "unless 
this office can find a position for you, in which case we will advise you".</p>
<p>On February 8, 1956, Arrieta sought the opinion of the Commissioner of Civil 
Service concerning the conditional acceptance by Governor Teves of his leave 
application; on March 14 of the same year, ho also brought the matter to the 
attention of then President Magsaysay; again on March 26, same year, he 
submitted his case to the Secretary of Finance, who, in turn, referred the 
matter to the Executive Secretary on April 23; and the latter official on May 
28, 1956, indorsed it to the Civil Service.</p>
<p>On July 2, 1956, the Civil Service Commissioner opined that "the position of 
Deputy Governor is not <em>per se</em> a primarily confidential position" which 
opinion was, on July 9, transmitted to Teves by the Executive Secretary, with 
the request that Arrieta be reinstated to his former position. On July 12, 1956, 
Resolution No. 2214 of the Negros Oriental Provincial Board was passed providing 
that, subject to the President's approval, the positions of deputy governor and 
special agent in the province should be considered primarily confidential. And 
on JuJy 14, Petitioner asked respondent Teves to reinstate him forthwith, but on 
July 16, respondent Teves wired the President requesting reconsideration of the 
indorsement received by him from the Executive Secretary about petitioner's 
reinstatement. Then on July 18, 1956, respondent Teves advised petitioner to 
consider himself as still out of the service pending his appeal to the 
President.</p>
<p>Finally, on August 27, 1956, acting on the Teves appeal, the Executive 
Secretary by authority of the President, and pursuant to sec. 671(1) of the 
Revised Administrative Code, and as recommended by the Commissioner of Civil 
Service, declared the position of deputy governor of Negros Oriental as 
primarily confidential.</p>
<p>Despite this official stand, Arrieta commenced the instant proceedings in the 
Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental seeking reinstatement via this 
<em>quo warranto</em> petition. After trial in said court, petitioner's action 
was dismissed; on appeal to the Court of Appeals, judgment was affirmed with 
costs.</p>
<p>Hence the petition for review to which we gave due course, upon petitioner's 
contention that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling: (a) that the position of 
Deputy Governor is primarily confidential in nature; (b) that petitioner had 
virtually acquiesced in his separation from office; and (c) that petitioner's 
cause of action accrued on January 11, 1956, so that the filing of this action 
on January 13, 1957, was out of time.</p>
<p>On the first question, it appears that the Court of Appeals found from 
petitioner's own documentary evidence that the duties of deputy governor of 
Nejrros Oriental were to be defined by the Provincial Governor; that the Deputy 
Governor performed only such duties and responsibilities as were delegated or 
assigned to him from time to time; and that as such delegate, he inspected and 
supervised local offices under the administrative control of tho Governor, and 
investigated complaints against local officials.</p>
<p>It seems obvious that as the only duties assigned to the Deputy Governor are 
those inherent in or pertaining to the office of the Provincial Governor which 
the latter, in the interest of the service may deem proper to delegate, such 
Deputy Governor must have the confidence of the Provincial Governor. He is 
actually the eyes and ears of said executive. True, every appointment implies 
confidence but, is this of an ordinary kind, limited to trust in the Deputy 
Governor's ability or aptitude? Or does it involve, as held in a case,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> "primarily close intimacy which insures 
freedom of intercourse without embarassment or freedom from misgivings of 
betrayal of personal trust or confidential matters of state?"</p>
<p>The answer seems clear. More than ordinary confidence and trust is necessary 
to induce a provincial governor to farm out such duties and functions to a 
deputy. Any lingering doubt regarding the confidential character of petitioner's 
position fades in the light of the presidential ruling on August 27, 1956, which 
classified it as primarily confidential.</p>
<p>Petitioner assails the application of this ruling and affirms that in 1956, 
when respondent Bellas was appointed to replace him, the position was not 
primarily confidential Note that the return indorsement of the Executive 
Secretary on July 9, 1956, urging respondent Teves to reinstate petitioner was 
appealed by the latter to the President on July 16, 1956, and, as stated, on 
August 27, 1956, said Executed Secretary's view was reversed. The later ruling 
was declaratory of the true nature of the position—primarily confidential—and 
petitioner may not successfully assail the validity of such ruling.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Withal, petitioner cannot escape the 
conclusion that when ho filed the instant petition for <em>quo warranto</em> on 
January 13, 1957, the position he claimed had already been declared primarily 
confidential.</p>
<p>His right at most, supposing that the position was not confidential in 1956 
when he was replaced, is to recover for .salaries; but his claim could bo 
validly defeated, what with his manifested desire to seek a transfer—which 
implied an admission that he could be (and had been) deprived of his position as 
a deputy-governor, perhaps because he had worked for the candidacy of the 
defeated Governor Bandoquillo. Considered from all pertinent angles, the 
equities of the case do not favor herein petitioner.</p>
<p>In this view of the matter, we find it unnecessary to pass on the timeliness 
of the action of <em>quo warranto</em>.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>
