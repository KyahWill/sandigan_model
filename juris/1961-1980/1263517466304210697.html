<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">Under
date of 25 April 1966, <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span> de la Cruz filed </span>a
<span style="">complaint against Julio Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Montes and Alfonso Miranda, praying the court to
have himself (plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span> de la
Cruz) declared as entitled to purchase, by way of pre-emption and legal
redemption, the one-half (1/2) portion of the land that was sold to Miranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of issues, the parties agreed, during the pre-trial of the case, to submit the
case for decision on the pleadings, and, on the basis thereof, the court below
rendered judgment, as stated at the beginning of this decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Not satisfied with the
court court's decision, plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span>
de la Cruz interposed the present direct appeal to the Supreme Court and
assigns the following errors as having been committed by the lower court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. The trial
court erred in holding that plaintiff-appellant and defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Julio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
Montes are not co-owners of the parcel of land embraced in Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 10680 of the Office of the Register of Deeds for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in concluding that
plaintiff is not entitled to the right of pre-emption or legal redemption.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in awarding damages in
the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in favor of defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Julio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
Mantes, and "another P2,000.00 in favor of their co-defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Alfonso Miranda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court finally erred in ordering
plaintiff-appellant to pay defendants -<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the
sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's theory, under
his first two assignments </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">error, is that, after he bought from the
spouses Julio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Montes the northern
half of the parcel of land embraced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 10680,
he and the spouses became co-owners of the said parcel of land, "the
plaintiff owning one-half (1/2) (northern part) and defen­dants Julio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Montes owning the remaining one-half (1/2) portion
(southern part)", or that," considering the situation or loca­tion of
the parts being owned by plaintiff and defendants Julio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Montes, respectively,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . . . . <span class="GramE">the</span>
parts are adjacent to each other, and consequently, plaintiff and defendants
Julio Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Montes are adjacent
owners" , such that plaintiff has the right of pre-emption or legal
redemption over the portion that was subsequently sold to Alfonso Miranda
(Quoted portions taken from appellant's brief, pages 3-4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing theory is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tested against the concept of
co-ownership, as authoritatively expressed by the commentators, appel­lant is
not</span> <span style="">a co-owner of the registered
parcel of land, taken as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">unit or subject of co-ownership, since he and
the spouses do not "have a spiritual part </span><span style="">of a </span>thing which is not <span style="">physically
divided" (3 Sanchez Roman 162), nor is each of them an "owner of the
whole, and over the whole he exercises the right of dominion, but, he is at the
same time the owner </span>of a portion which is truly <span style="">abstract<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . ." <span class="GramE">(3 </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Manresa</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><span style=""> 405).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
portions of <span style="">appellant-plaintiff and </span>of
the <span style="">defendant spouses are concretely
determined and identifiable, for to the former belongs the northern half, and
to the latter belongs the remaining southern half', of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That their respective portions are not technically
described, or that said portions are still embraced in one and the same
certificate of title, does not make said portions less determinable or
identifiable, or distinguishable, one from the other, nor that dominion over
each portion less exclusive, in their respective owners. 'Hence, no right of
redemption among co-owners exists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor is
plaintiff-appellant entitled, as an adjoining owner, to the right of
pre-emption or redemption over the southern portion of the parcel of land
because he had not alleged in his complaint and has not proved (since the case
was submitted for decision on the pleadings) that said portion is so small and
so situated that a major portion thereof cannot be used for any practical
purpose within a reasonable time, having been bought merely for speculation
(Article 1622, Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">Soriente</span> vs. GA, L-17343,
31 August 1963, 62 O. G. 7013, 8 SCRA 750).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The third assignment of
error is concerned with the defendants' counterclaim. The court <u>a quo</u>
awarded damages of P2,000.00 to the spouses Cruz and another P2,000.00 to their
co-defendant Alfonso Miranda because the court considered the allegations on
two (2) causes </span>of <span style="">action in the
counterclaim as not specifically denied by the plaintiff-appellant and,
therefore, deemed to have admitted said allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first cause of action, in brief, alleges
that plaintiff had failed to cause the preparation and submission of a
subdivision plan that Would serve as a basis for the issuance of separate
titles for the northern and southern parts of the land, contrary to their
agreement, and for the inaction and delay on the part of plaintiff had caused
damages in the amount</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of </span>P5, <span style="">000.00 to the counterclaimants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second cause of action, in turn, alleges that the plaintiff had
refused to surrender the certificate of title, despite demands, to the Register
of Deeds for an­notation of a release of mortgage that said plaintiff had
himself executed, thus preventing the dealing with the land, sans the
encumbrance, with third persons and prejudicing the counterclaimants in the sum
of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. Appellant's argument that the court
erred in awarding damages without proof of the amount of actual damage is
well-taken, for even though the rule is that failure to deny specifically the
material allegations in the complaint (or counterclaim) is deemed an admission
of the said allegations, an exception is provided <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
which is "other than those as to the amount of damage" (Section 1,
Rule 9, Revised Rules of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“ . . . . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under section
8, Rule 9 [Sec. 1, Rule 9 of the Revised Rules of Court], however, allegations
regarding the amount of dam­ages are not deemed admitted even if not
specifically denied, and so must be duly proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants did not offer to present evidence
to prove their dama­ges but merely asked for judgment on the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they must be considered to have waived
or renounced their claim for damages. . . . . . ." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rili</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Chunaco</span>, et al.,
L-6630, 29 February 1956, 98 Phil. 505, 507).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On his last assignment of
error, appellant contests the award of attorney's fees on the ground that such
fees do not accrue merely because of an adverse decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, he does not claim </span>that
the court below had abused its discretion in giving the award, which is a
matter that is discretionary with it under Article 2208, Civil Code of the
Philippines, specially since the action was clearly unfounded (Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Justiva</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>, et
al., L-16396, 31 Jan­uary 1963, 7 SCRA 72; Lopez, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, et al., L-18788, 31 January 1964, 10 SCRA 167).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">FOR THE FOREGOING
REASONS</span></b><span style="">, the appealed
decision is hereby affirmed, except insofar as it awarded damages to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, which is hereby reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
