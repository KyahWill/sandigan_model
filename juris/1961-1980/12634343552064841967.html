				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Treating this Petition as a special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i>,
we affirm the Decision of the Court of Appeals denying petitioners' prayer to
set aside the trial Court Order, dated <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1975</st1:date>, to surrender the barge in question under pain of
contempt, and its subsequent Orders denying their Motion for Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the following background facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 31, 1973, respondent Associated Banking Corporation
(the Bank, for short) instituted an action, Civil Case No. 89692, in the Court
of First Instance of Manila, Branch XXVIII, respondent Judge, presiding,
against private respondent <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern Wood
Industries, Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern, for brevity), a
domestic corporation, for recovery of a sum of money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> application by the Bank
for a Writ of Preliminary Attachment, respondent Judge, after the filing and
approval of the required bond of P220,000.00, issued, on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1974</st1:date>, an Order of Attachment
commanding the Sheriff to attach the estate, real and personal, of <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1974</st1:date>,
the Sheriff's "Notice of Levy Pursuant to the Writ of Attachment" was
registered in the Office of the Commander of the First Coast Guard, District of
Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to Sec. 805 of the Tariff and Customs Code, as amended by Presidential
Decree No. 34, requiring the registration of documents affecting titles of
vessels with that entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
notice read, "levy is hereby made upon all the rights, titles, interest,
shares and participation which the defendant <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern
Wood Industries, Inc. has or might have over a sea vessel or barge named <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern V."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that prior to the issuance of said Writ of Attachment,
<span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern had delivered the barge to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Development
Corporation sometime in April, 1973, for repair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The job was completed in June 1973, but <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern failed to pay the cost of repairs of
P261,190.59.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the provisions
of Article 2112<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in relation to Article 1731<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code, the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
Development Corporation proceeded before Notary Public Clemente R. Gonzales of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to the sale of said barge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the public
auction sale conducted by said Notary Public on <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1974</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> acquired the barge as the highest bidder, and
was accordingly issued a Certificate of Sale by the Notary Public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Development Cor­poration issued an Affidavit
of Release of mechanic's lien against <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Certificate of Sale was received in the
office of the Philippine Coast Guard on <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="5">May
 3, 1974</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was not until <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1974</st1:date>,
however, that Certificate of Ownership No. 8647, a Certificate of Philippine
Register, a Certi­ficate of Change of Name of Vessel from "<span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern V" to "Satellite II", as well as
a Coastwise License were issued to <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> by the
Philippine Coast Guard.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
These <span class="SpellE">muniments</span> of title were issued only after
counsel for <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
had assured the Philippine Coast Guard, in a letter dated November 13, 1974,
that "without touching on the merit of the preference of our client's
claim in relation to the levy registered by other claimants, such levy is not
in any manner a legal obstacle to the registration of the vessels in our
client's name."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting thereon, the Acting Command­ant of the Philippine Coast Guard in a
letter dated <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1974</st1:date>,
authorized the issuance of a new certificate of registration "annotating
thereon any levy validly registered against said vessel(s)".<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
However, neither the Certificate of Ownership nor the Certificate of Philippine
Register appended as Annexes "C" and "D", respectively, to
petitioners' Urgent Manifestation and Motion filed before the lower Court<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
carry that annotation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 29, 1974, the Bank filed a "Motion for the
Issuance of Another Writ of Attachment" stating that at the time of the
issuance of the Writ on February 4, 1974, the barge in question could not be
located within the jurisdiction of the trial Court, having been anchored
somewhere in the <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span>, and that actual levy on the
barge could not be made as "the original Order of attachment is allegedly
in the possession of the Branch Deputy Sheriff appointed by the Honorable
Court, who has not reported to the office since August 26, 1974, and,
therefore, could not implement the writ".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
On the same date, August 29, 1974, the trial Court (Judge Rafael S. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, presi­ding) denied the issuance of another Writ
(apparently because it was deemed unnecessary), but instead ordered the Deputy
Sheriff of Branch XXVIII to coordinate with the City Sheriff of Manila in the
implementation of the Writ previously issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1974</st1:date>, Deputy
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Garvida</span> actually seized and levied upon the
vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1974</st1:date>,
respondent Bank and respondent <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern submitted
a Compromise Agreement whereby <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern bound
itself to pay to the Bank the principal amount of P200,000.00, with 14%
interest, plus other amounts stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1974</st1:date>,
respondent Judge approved the Agreement and rendered judgment accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="11">November
 6, 1974</st1:date>, the Bank moved for the issuance of a Writ of Execution for
failure of <span class="SpellE">Fil</span>-Eastern to make payments within the
period stipulated in the Compromise Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, without prior authority from Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Garvida</span>, the barge in question was "spirited
away" to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> by a certain Captain <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Agito</span>, who claimed to

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued an Order requiring Capt. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agito</span> in coordination with Deputy Sheriff Benjamin E.
<span class="SpellE">Garvida</span> to bring back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1975</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1975, Capt. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Agito</span> and Deputy Sheriff Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Garvida</span>

petitioners, and all persons claiming under them, be directed to surrender the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioners filed before the trial Court an Urgent Manifestation and Motion
seeking to set aside the Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1975</st1:date>, claiming that <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> is now the
new owner of the barge having acquired the same at a public auction sale
arising from a mechanic's lien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Motion was denied by respondent Judge on the ground that the records belied
petitioners' claim that the auction sale occurred very much ahead of the notice
of levy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' first and second
Motion for Reconsideration were similarly denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="7">July

under guard.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioners sought relief from the Court of Appeals by filing a "Petition
for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction and
Preliminary Mandatory Injunction" assailing and seeking to vacate the
Orders issued in Civil Case No. 89692 by respondent Judge as well as the Writs,
notices and other processes emanating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> in denying the Petition in its Decision
promulgated on <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1975</st1:date>,
ruled that <i>Certiorari</i> did not lie as petitioner was not without
sufficient and adequate remedy to obtain relief from the damaging effects of
the Orders complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed the present Petition on <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1976</st1:date> before this Court, claiming that
they are purchasers in good faith and for valuable consideration, having
actually paid the total amount of P354,689.00 to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Development Corporation for three barges, one
of which is the barge in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
have also raised the following legal issues:</p>

<blockquote>"1. The
decision of the res­pondent Court of Appeals sustaining the challenged orders,
writs and other processes issued by the respondent Judge is contrary to the
provisions of Art. 1731 in relation to Art. 2112 of the New Civil Code and to
the ruling laid down in Bank of P.I. vs. Walter A. Smith &amp; Co., 55 Phil.
533 and <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> Motor Co. vs. Mendoza, 43 Phil. 410.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the levy and/or attachment by the sheriff
of the barge in question are illegal, will herein petitioner be required to
avail of Section 14, Rule 57 and/or Section 17, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of
Court?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1976</st1:date>,
we issued a Restraining Order enjoining respondents from proceeding with the
projected sale at public auction of the barge, subject of this litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also declared the case submitted for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1977</st1:date>, the Bank filed a Motion for
Authority to Sell the barge under attachment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was opposed, however, by petitioners and we resolved to defer
resolution until decision on the merits is rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1979</st1:date>,
the Bank filed a Motion for Early Resolution, but the same was <span class="SpellE">agendaed</span> only on <st1:date year="1979" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take note of
the Bank's contention that ever since the Sheriff took custody of the vessel on
<st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1975</st1:date>, the same has
been lying idle, moored at the <span class="SpellE">Muelle</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Industria</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>, exposed to the elements, and
has deteriorated rapidly, hence the need for early resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be reiterated that this is a special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i>,
the main requisites for the issuance of which Writ are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) that the Writ be directed against a
tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial functions; 2) that such
tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or
with grave abuse of discretion; and 3) that there is no appeal, nor any plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
While the first requisite has been met, the second and the third have not.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the findings of the Court of Appeals that
petitioners were not without any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the
ordinary course of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, upon
the issuance of the Order, dated <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1974</st1:date>, commanding the implementation of the Writ of Attachment,
petitioners could have availed themselves of the remedy provided for in Section
14, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"If the property taken be claimed by any person other than the
party against whom attach­ment had been issued or his agent, and such person
makes an affidavit of his title thereto or right to the possession thereof,
stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves such affidavit upon the
officer while the latter has possession of the property, and a copy thereof
upon the attaching creditor, the officer shall not be bound to keep the
property under attachment, unless the attaching creditor or his agent, on
demand of the said officer, secures him against such claim by a bond in a sum
not greater than the value of the property attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For another, when respondent Sheriff seized the vessel in
question to be sold at public auction in accordance with the Order of execution
of <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1975</st1:date>, petitioner
could have availed of the remedy under Section 17, Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"If the property levied on be claimed by any other person than
the judgment debtor or his agent, and such person make an affidavit of his
title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such
right or title, and serve the same upon the officer making the levy, and a copy
thereof upon the judgment creditor, the officer shall not be bound to keep the
property, unless such judgment creditor or his agent, on demand of the officer,
indemnify the officer against such claim by a bond in a sum not greater than
the value of the property levied on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
argues, however, that he could not avail of the foregoing Rules inasmuch as the
vessel was not in the actual custody of the Sheriff nor of the Court, since the
supposed levy by the Sheriff on February 7, 1974 was a mere paper levy which,
in legal contemplation, is no levy at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fact that respondent Sheriff could not effect seizure
immediately, first, because the barge could nowhere be found in this vicinity,
and subsequently when found, because petitioners would not deliver possession
to the Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until the
trial Court granted the Sheriff's Motion praying for an Order directing
petitioners or their agents to surrender the barge to the custody of the Court,
that the Sheriff was able to take physical custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, however, a levy of an
attachment upon personal property may be either actual or constructive.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, levy had been constructively made by the registration of the same
with the Philippine Coast Guard on <st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="2">February
 7, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Constructive
possession should be held sufficient where actual possession is not feasible,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
particularly, when it was followed up by the actual seizure of the property as
soon as that could possibly be effected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further argue that the levy was illegal because the
Writ was implemented more than sixty days after its issuance so that they need
not have complied with Section 14, Rule 57, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rules do not provide any lifetime for a
Writ of Attachment unlike a Writ of Execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even granting that a Writ of Attachment is valid for only sixty
days, yet, since there was constructive levy within that period the fact that
actual seizure was effected only thereafter cannot affect the validity of that
levy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be said that respondent Judge committed grave
abuse of discretion in issuing the chal­lenged Order of April 14, 1975, <u>supra</u>,
whereby it commanded the immediate implementation of the Order of execution of
March 7, 1975 and ordered petitioners to surrender possession of the barge to
the Sheriff under pain of contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
trial Court is enjoined by law to bring about a prompt dispatch of the controversy
pending before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was, it took
the trial Court more than a year to cause the enforce­ment of its Writs and
processes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, its Decision of <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1974</st1:date> had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and execution then became purely a ministerial
phase of adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had no
jurisdiction to pass upon petitioners' claim of ownership not only because
trial in that case had already been terminated but also considering that
petitioners were not parties in the case below nor had they filed any
third-party claim for the enforcement of their rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, petitioners' remedy was to ventilate their claims of
ownership in a separate and independent <span class="SpellE">reivindicatory</span>
action, as even then suggested by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the arena where the question of
preferential rights, if any, impliedly raised in the first assigned error,
could have been fully threshed out.</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> a third person claiming to be the
owner of the property attached or levied upon is requires to file a separate or
independent action to determine whether the property should answer for the
claim of the attaching or judgment creditor instead of being allowed to raise
that issue in the case where the writ of attachment or execution was issued
(Sec. 17, Rule 39 and sec. 14, Rule 57, Rules of Court; Bayer Philippines, Inc.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>, L-38701, April 8,1975, 63 SCRA 355).<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the interest of justice, petitioners can still file an
independent civil action to establish their ownership over the barge, if they
have not yet done so.</p>
