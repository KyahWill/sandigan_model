				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The broad, all-embracing sweep of the self-incrimination clause,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
whenever appropriately invoked, has been accorded due recognition by this Court
ever since the adoption of the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

decided in 1937, was quite categorical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we there stated: "This Court <span style="">is </span>of the opinion that in order that the constitutional provision
under consideration may prove to be a real protection and not a dead letter, <span style="">it must be given <span style="">a </span>liberal and broad interpretation favorable to the person
invoking it." </span>As phrased by <span style="">Justice
Laurel in his concurring opinion: "The provision, <span style="">as </span>doubtless it <span style="">was </span>de­signed,
would be construed with the utmost liberality in favor of the right of the
individual intended to be served."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even more relevant, considering the precise point at issue, is
the recent case of Cabal v. <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held that a respondent in an administrative proceeding under the
Anti-Graft Law<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
cannot be required to take the witness stand at the instance of the com­plainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it must be in this case, where petitioner
was sustained by the lower court in his plea that he could not be compelled to
be the first witness of the <span style="">complainants,
he </span>being the party proceeded against in an administrative charge for
malpractice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a correct
decision; we affirm it on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
Jr., petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, filed on February 1, 1965
with the Court of First Instance of Manila an action for prohibition with
prayer for prelim­inary injunction against the Board of Medical Examiners, now
respondent-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged
therein that at the initial hearing of an administrative case<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
for alleged immorality, counsel for complainants announced that he would
present as his first witness herein peti­tioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
who was the respondent in such mal­practice charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
<span style="">through </span>counsel, made of record
his objection, relying on the constitutional right to be exempt from being a
witness against himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent-appellant, the Board of Examiners, took note of such <span style="">a </span>plea, at the same time stating that
at the next scheduled hearing, on February 12, 1965, petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would be called upon to testify as such witness,
unless in the meantime he could secure a restraining order from a competent
authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> then alleged that
in thus ruling to compel him to take the witness stand, the Board of Examiners
was guilty, at the very least, of grave abuse of discretion for failure to
respect the constitutional right against self-incrimination, the administrative
proceeding against him, which could result in forfeiture or loss of a
privilege, being quasi-criminal in character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With his assertion that he was entitled to the <span style="">relief demanded consisting of perpetually restraining the respondent
Board </span>from compelling him to testify <span style="">as </span>witness for his adversary and his readiness or his
willingness to put <span style="">a </span>bond, he
prayed for a writ of preliminary in­junction and after a hearing or trial, for
a writ of prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1965</st1:date>,
the lower court ordered that <span style="">a </span>writ
of preliminary injunction issue against the res­pondent Board commanding it to
refrain from hearing or further proceeding with such an administrative case, to
await the judicial disposition of the matter upon peti­tioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> posting <span style="">a
</span>bond in the amount of P500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of respondent Board, while admitting the facts
stressed that it could call petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to
the witness stand and interrogate him, the right against self-incrimination
being available only when <span style="">a </span>question
calling for an incriminating answer is asked of a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further elaborated the matter in the
affirmative defenses interposed, stating that petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
remedy is to object once he is in the witness stand, for respondent <span style="">"a </span>plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law," precluding the issuance of the
relief sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Board,
therefore, denied that it acted with grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was a motion for intervention by Salvador <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span>, the complainants in the administrative case for
malpractice against petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, asking that
they be allowed to file an answer as <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a motion was granted and an answer in
intervention was duly filed by them on <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1965</st1:date> sustaining the power of respondent Board, which for them
is limited to compelling the witness to take the stand, to be distinguished, in
their opinion, from the power to compel a witness to incriminate himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They likewise alleged that the right against
self-incrimination cannot he availed of in an administrative hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">A decision was rendered by the lower court on <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1965</st1:date>, finding the claim of
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to be well-founded and
prohibiting respondent Board "from compelling the petitioner to act and
testify as a witness for the com­plainant in said investigation without his
consent and against himself." Hence this appeal both by respondent Board
and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted at the outset, we find for the
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm the lower court
decision on appeal as it does manifest fealty to the principle announced by us
in Cabal v. <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that proceeding for certiorari and
prohibition to annul an order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>, it
appeared that an administrative charge for unexplained wealth having been filed
against petitioner under the Anti-Graft Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the complainant requested the investi­gating committee that petitioner be
ordered to take the witness stand, which request was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon peti­tioner's refusal to be sworn <span style="">as </span>such witness, a charge for
contempt was filed against him in the sala of respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed a motion to quash and upon its
denial, he initiated this proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
found for the petitioner in accordance with the well-settled principle that
"the accused in a criminal case may refuse, not only to answer
incriminatory questions, but, also, to take the witness stand."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was noted in the opinion penned by the present Chief Justice
that while the matter referred to an administrative charge of unexplained
wealth, with the Anti-Graft Act authorizing the forfeiture of whatever property
<span style="">a </span>public officer or employee
may acquire, manifestly out of proportion to his salary and his other lawful
income, there is clearly the imposition of a penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding for forfeiture while
administrative in character thus possesses <span style="">a criminal </span>or penal aspect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case before us is not dissimilar; petitioner would be similarly
disadvantaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could suffer not the
forfeiture of property but the revocation of his license as a medical
practitioner, for some an even greater deprivation.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the argument that Cabal v. <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>
could thus be distinguished, it suffices to refer to an American Supreme Court
opinion highly persuasive in character.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the language of Justice Douglas: "We conclude * * * that the
Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amend­ment has been absorbed in the
Fourteenth, that it ex­tends its protection to lawyers as well as to other
individuals, and that it should not be watered down by imposing the dishonor of
disbarment and the deprivation of a livelihood as a price for asserting
it." We rei­terate that such a principle is equally applicable to a
proceeding that could possibly result in the loss of the privilege to practice
the medical profession.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal apparently
proceeds on the mistaken assumption by respondent Board and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>-appellants
that the constitutional guarantee against self-incrim­ination should be limited
to allowing a witness to ob­ject to questions the answers to which could lead
to a penal liability being subsequently incurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that one aspect of such <span style="">a </span>right, to follow the language of
another American decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
is the protection against "any disclosures which the witness may
reasonably apprehend could be used in <span style="">a
criminal </span>prosecution or which could lead to other evidence that might be
so used." If that were all there is then it becomes diluted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional guarantee protects <span style="">as </span>well the right to silence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far back as 1905, we had occasion to declare: "The accused has a
perfect right to remain silent and his silence cannot be used as a presumption
of his guilt.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Only last year, in Chavez v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
speaking through Justice Sanchez, we reaffirmed the doctrine anew that is the
right of a defendant "to forego testimony, to remain silent, unless he
chooses to take the witness stand - with undiluted, unfettered exercise of his
own free genuine will."</p>

<p class="BODY">Why it should be thus is not difficult to discern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional guarantee, along with
other rights granted an accused, stands for a belief that while crime should
not go unpunished and that the truth must be revealed, such desirable
objectives should not be ac­complished according to means or methods offensive
to the high sense of respect accorded the human personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More and more in line with the democratic
creed, the deference accorded an individual even those suspected of the most
heinous crimes is given due weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
quote from Chief Justice Warren, "the constitutional foundation underlying
the privilege is the respect a government * * * must accord to the dignity and
integ­rity of its citizens."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise of interest to note that while earlier decisions
stressed the principle of humanity on which this right is predicated,
precluding as it does all re­sort to force or compulsion, whether physical or
mental, current judicial opinion places equal emphasis on its identification
with the right to privacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus accord­ing
to Justice Douglas: "The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination clause
enables the citizen to create <span style="">a </span>zone
of privacy which government may not force to surrender to his detriment."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
So also with the observation of the late Judge Frank who spoke of <span style="">"a </span>right to a private enclave
where he may lead a private life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
right is the hallmark of our democracy."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above, it could thus clearly appear that no
possible objection could be legitimately raised against the correctness of the
decision now on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that in
an administrative hearing against a medical practitioner for alleged
malpractice, respondent Board of Medical Examiners cannot, consistent­ly with
the self-incrimination clause, compel the person proceeded against to take the
witness stand without his consent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court of August 2,
1965 is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement
