Court of Appeals <span style="">(in </span>CA-G.</span>
R. No. 35519-R) ordering the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
to approve the appeals <span style="">in its </span>Civil
Case No. 5483 and Land Registration Case No. N-250 previously disallowed by the
latter court; requiring the appellants <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> to
post an additional appeal bond of <span style="">P</span>120.00
in 10 days; and suspending the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
pertinent decrees and titles (issued in connection with the land registration
case) until the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span>' joint appeal has been
finally resolved by the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"In Civil Case 5483, CFI <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
Province, instituted on November 5, 1953, wherein the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
are the plaintiffs and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>,
the defendant, involving a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u>
sale of P35,000.00 over four (4) parcels of land with a total area of 1,386
hectares, more or less, situated in the Municipality <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Mulanay</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
the Lower Court rendered judgment on November 19, 1962 in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span> and against <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>
declaring the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> sale and
the affidavit of consolidation dated July 12, 1951 as null and void and without
force and effect, absolving the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span> from paying
defendant <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span> the liability of P35,000.00, the
consideration of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u>
de retro</u>, without pronouncement as to costs (Record 68).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 7, 1953, <span style="">in
</span>Land Registration Case N-250, the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span>
filed an application for registration over 16 lots which included the lands
subject of the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> sale,
involved in Civil Case 5483 above cited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Spouses <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>
and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Adap</span> filed an opposition upon the ground
that the redemption period of the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de
retro</u> sale had already expired on October 31, 1947 without any repurchase
having been made (Record 40).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon the order of the Lower Court on March 1, 1954, the joint
trial of Civil Case 5483 and Land Registration Case N-250 was decreed (Record
42).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a joint hearing of the two
cases, the Lower Court rendered a separate judgment in Land Registration Case
N-250, on November 21, 1962, adjudicating the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u>
de retro</u> properties in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span>
(Record 71)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records show that
copies of the decisions in both the civil and land registration cases, mailed
together in one envelope, were received by counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span>
on January 28, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 23,
1963, the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> filed in the two cases a motion
for new trial, which motion was denied on March 7, 1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of this denial order was received by
Atty. Ruben <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, counsel for the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span>, on April 8, 1963.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 10, 1963, a
messenger of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> filed in the Clerk's office
(of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Province),
for both cases, a notice of appeal and record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice of appeal, which was incorporated
in the record on appeal, contained the following statement:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Simultaneously with this Notice of Appeal, defendants in
Civil Case No. 5483 and <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in L. R. C. Case
No. N-250 have deposited with the Clerk of Court of this Honorable Court the
amount of P60.00 as the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span>' appeal bond as
shown by O. R. No. H-3038791 dated April 10, 1963." (p. 174, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">As
by order of January 26, 1965 the trial court disapproved their appeals for
being out of time, the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> resorted to the
Court of Appeals in a petition for certiorari and mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, upon proper showing that </span>during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> in the trial court of the motion for
approval of the appeals the corresponding decrees and certificates of title
over the properties subject of the proceeding were issued in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span>, the Court of Appeals, at the instance of therein
petitioners, directed the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction
restraining the exercise by the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span> of any act
of ownership of the same properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 15, 1965, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment, as stated
at the beginning of this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Motions for reconsideration of the decision were denied by resolutions
of February 9 and March 16, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties herein are agreed that the filing by the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> on April 10, 1963 of the notice of appeal and record
on appeal was on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present
petition against the ruling of the Court of Appeals approving the appeals,
however, was based mainly on two grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the alleged failure of the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> to
furnish herein petitioners with copy of the appeal bond; and (2) the invalidity
of the deposit of the appeal bond for P60.00, <span style="">petitioners </span>claiming that said bond was not only inadequate<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but also that it was deposited with the Provincial Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> and not with the Clerk of Court, contrary to the requirement
of Section 3, Rule 41, of the old Rules of Court <a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which is applicable to the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no error in the Court of Appealsâ€™ overruling of the
allegation of lack of service of the appeal bond upon the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As appeal bond in the two cases, the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> made <span style="">a </span>cash deposit of P60.00 on April 10,
1963.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was specifically alleged in
the record on appeal, of which the <span class="SpellE">Rosaleses</span> were
duly served with copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inclusion of
the statement in the record on appeal, which put petitioners on notice of the
amount and date of filing of the appeal bond, constitutes sufficient compliance
with the rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it may be observed
that Section 3 of the old Rule 41 simply required that said party be furnished
with the notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal, and did not
prescribe any particular mode or manner in which the adverse party is to be
informed of the filing of the necessary papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rules could not have confined compliance therewith to the service of
separate or individual copies of the notices, but should have contemplated also
of notices placed together in a single pleading or instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, judicial cognizance may be taken of
the practice of incorporating the notice of appeal in the record on appeal as
part of said record, in which practice we see nothing objectionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, no practical benefit would be
attained in requiring individual and separate service to the adverse party of
the notice of appeal and the record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As this Court had previously ruled, the act of filing a record on appeal
is by itself eloquent indication of the party's intention to appeal; thus,
although there was no proof that a notice of appeal had been filed, the appeal
was nevertheless allowed, upon proper showing that there was a record on appeal
already submitted to the court for approval.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is true that in this case the statement or certification reÂ­garding the
appeal bond was not entirely accurate as to the office where the bond was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, it cannot be denied
that the notification made in the record on appeal was adequate enough to
satisfy the purpose of the requirement, which is to inform and enable the
adverse party to object <u>to the amount</u> of the deposited bond and
accordingly guide the court into deciding whether or not the appeal is to be
allowed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The primary issue in this
case actually lies on the effect of the deposit of </span>P60.<span style="">00, intended as appeal bond, with the
Provincial Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, petitioners claiming
that the deposit was irregular and defective and did not result in the
perfection of the appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span>, on the other hand, argue (a) that the deposit
with the Provincial Treasurer is equivalent to the filing of the appeal bond
with the Clerk of Court, since the Provincial Treasurer is the representative
of the National Treasurer to whom the Clerk of Court anyway would ultimately
deliver the funds he has collected; and (b) that the collection by the
Provincial Treasurer of only P60.00 as appeal bond for the two cases, instead
of </span>P120.00, was <span style="">an inÂ­nocent
mistake that should not bar the appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is evidence on
record that on </span><span style="">April 10, </span><span style="">1963, or prior to the exÂ­piration of the
period to appeal, which was April 12, 1963, a messenger </span>of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, carrying with him the sum of P120.00, <span class="SpellE">travelled</span> from Manila to <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
province to file the appeal with the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one reason or another, while he was able
to file the record on appeal in the Clerk's office, he was not able to deposit
the appeal bond and was directed instead by somebody in the said office to make
the payment to the Provincial Treasurer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Deputy Provincial Treasurer accepted the payment, but only <span style="">in </span>the sum of P60.00, specifying in
the corresponding receipt issued to the payee (O. R. H-3038791) that it was
"for appeal bond deposit on Civil Case 5483 &amp; Land Reg. Case No. <span class="GramE">N-250".</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
receipt number, date of payment, and amount of deposit was not only annotated
on the court's copy of the notice of appeal but also, appeared in the record on
appeal filed with the Clerk of Court and furnished to the adverse party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we hold that the appeal
in the two cases should have been allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering that under
the Judiciary Act -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All moneys accruing to the Government, in the Supreme Court,
in the Court of Appeals, and in the Courts of First Instance, including fees,
fines, forfeitures, costs; or other miscellaneous receipts, and <u>all trust or
depository funds paid into the courts shall be received by the corresponding
clerk of court</u> and in the absence of special provision, <u>shall be paid by
him into the National Treasury</u> to the credit of the proper account or fund
and under such regulations as shall be prescribed, by the Auditor General"
(Sec. 6, Republic Act 296; underlining supplied);</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">considering further that an appeal bond
is one such trust or depository fund that has to be transmitted to the National
Treasury; that the Provincial Treasurer is a person authorized to receive
payments; and that there is no showing that the deposit so made has not been
actually remitted to the National Treasury and credited to the proper account
or fund <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the deposit in question, made
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period and duly annotated on
the records, can be considered in substantial compliance with Section 3 of Rule
41.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it is true that for the two cases the appeal bond
should be P120.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objection,
however, to the allowance of the appeals on ground of insufficiency of the bond
could be met by the pronouncement of this Court <span style="">in </span>the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span><u>
vs. De Guzman</u>, 93 Phil. 824.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
case, a civil case and a land registration case, involving the same parties
represented by the same attorneys, were tried jointly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment in both cases having been rendered,
counsel for the losing party presented a notice of appeal, a joint record on
appeal, and an appeal bond for P60.00, which was deposited in the civil
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bond in the registration case
was filed about two months thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Granting certiorari against the trial court's order allowing only the
appeal in the civil case, this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"But while we hold that there is no error of law committed by
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in dismissing the appeal in the registration
case, there are potent reasons why, in the exercise of its discretion, it
should have decreed otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is
the fact that the civil case is entirely dependent upon the regisÂ­tration case;
no recovery of possession can be decreed in favor of, and no damages can accrue
to, the plaintiff unless he is declared the owner of the property subject of both
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When defendant, therefore,
questioned plaintiff's right to the possession and to damages, he must have
meant to question plaintiff's title to the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other reason is the fact that as the two
cases were so inextricably related to each other, and they were tried jointly,
and only one joint record on appeal presented, appellant's attorney or his
client or both may have overlooked the need of filing two bonds, or thought
that one was sufficient without the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This constitutes an excusable oversight.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners belabor the point that, unlike in the case cited
above, there were two separate decisions of the trial court involved herein,
and that there were parties in the land registration proceeding who were not
included in the civil case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no
significance in the distinction:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>precisely, it was held in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span>
case that the rendition of a single decision did not alter the fact that there
were actually two cases therein involved; and the opposition of the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> in the land registration case was based on the <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span><u> de retro</u> contract and their
consolidation of ownership of the disputed lots, and the validity of these acts
were exactly the subject of the civil case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, between the petitioners and the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span>,
the controversial issues in both the civil and land registration cases are, if
not the same, at least inextricably related to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have here the situation that brought about
the ruling in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Aquino</u></span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to state, there being a finding of excusable oversight
in the deposit of only P60.00 as appeal bond in the two cases, the Court of
Appeals' order to the <span class="SpellE">Escuderos</span> to pay an additional
bond for P60.00 (not P120.00), is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals under
review is affirmed, with costs against the petiÂ­tioners.</p>
