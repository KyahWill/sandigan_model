				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Upon the averment that respondent judge is without authority and
is disqualified to act, petitioner comes to this Court on prohibition and
mandamus to stop the judge, presiding over Branch IV, Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, from taking cognizance of, and to require
him to return to Branch IV of the same court, Civil Case 4871,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in which petitioner, a member of the Bar, is one of the defendants and
cross-defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, because
petitioner's original petition for the same purpose was thwarted by the Court
of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">To better understand this case, it is necessary to narrate in
some detail the events that transpired between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baldo­mero</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> and respondent Judge Union C. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> that spawned the legal controversy now before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Union C. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan's</span> oath of office
described his position as "Judge, CFI of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Prov</span>.

On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1965</st1:date>, by
Administrative Order 268, he was authorized "in addition to his regular
duties, to hold court in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, effective <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1965</st1:date>, or as soon
thereafter as practicable, for the purpose of trying all kinds of cases and to
enter judgments therein." By virtue of this order, Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> proceeded to hold court sessions in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1965" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1965</st1:date> in

source of authority Section 56 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Turning back to the case before us, on <st1:date year="1948" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1948</st1:date>, Civil Case 4871 was commenced in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> by <span class="SpellE">Bibiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Natalio</span>
A. Enriquez and Susana Enriquez against <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ona</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> (petitioner herein), Andrea <span class="SpellE">Afri­cano</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span> Castillo, and Romeo, <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Clarito</span>, all sur­named <span class="SpellE">Baldeo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs therein sought to set aside the
April 17, 1944 decision in Civil Cases 6 and 26 of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> approving the parties' April 15, 1944
compromise agree­ment which allegedly was procured thru duress and
intimidation, and questioned <span class="SpellE">Luque's</span> attorneys' fees
as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Sinforoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Ona</span>
in said cases. <span class="SpellE">Enriqueta</span> Castillo, in the same Civil
Case 4871, filed a cross-claim against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Luque</span> and others.</p>

<p class="BODY">By notice of hearing dated <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1965</st1:date>, Civil Case 4871 was set for trial on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1965</st1:date> before <u>Branch</u>
<u>I</u> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
presided over by Judge Gabriel Valero.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1965</st1:date>
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> first took cognizance of said
Civil Case 4871.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to plain­tiffs'
attorney in the case below,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1965</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the morning, he found that Civil Case
4871 "was <u>not</u> <u>included</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>calendar</u> <u>of</u>
<u>cases</u> scheduled for Branch I"; that "he looked up the calendar
of the other <span class="SpellE">sala</span>", and finding his case there,
he thus appeared therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
"other <span class="SpellE">sala</span>" is that of Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
and cross-defendant <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span>
(petitioner herein) was absent therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Going by petitioner's version, he was at Branch I "where he should
be"; after he was informed by Judge Gabriel Valero hearing cases at Branch
I that Civil Case 4871 was in Branch IV, he proceeded to said branch but was
informed <span style="">by </span>a clerk that
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> had already left for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge's order of November 5 was prefaced by the
following words: "When this case was called today for hear­ing, neither
the counsel for the defendants and cross-claimant as well as counsel for the
cross-defendant appeared." That order reset the hearing for <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1965</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner submits to be inaccurate that part
of the order that <span style="">says </span>that he
did not appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because, so he says, he
was there in court, although at Branch I.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next pertinent order by respondent judge was made on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>, which set the case
for hearing on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This last mentioned date was admittedly
erroneous because the parties agreed on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1966</st1:date> to reset the hearing for March 8.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the start of the hearing on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1966</st1:date>, petitioner <span style="">was </span>present, the other parties absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for plaintiffs came 20 minutes late;
he got wind of the hearing on that date after he left the other <span class="SpellE">sala</span> attending to another case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought all along that the case was to be
heard on March 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another order of the
same date (February 28) reset the case for March 8, as originally scheduled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the March 8 hearing, petitioner sent by registered mail on
March 3 (received by the court on March 7) a motion for postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not appear on March 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted the court to order the
resetting of the hearing to March 23; but the court also directed petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> and another
attorney for defendants in "twenty-four (24) hours upon receipt hereof, to
explain why they should not be cited for contempt."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner again decries that this order is wrong because his
explanation in writing was already made in his motion for post­ponement; and
that furthermore since his motion for postponement was dated May 3, not May 7
as stated in the order, said motion was not <span style="">in </span>violation of the three-day rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, the ex­planation in
writing thereafter made by petitioner was considered satisfactory by respondent
judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner lodged a motion to dismiss the <span style="">case </span>upon the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge on <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1966</st1:date> denied this motion for the reason
that <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is not one of the grounds for a motion <span style="">to </span>dismiss under the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner moved to disqualify respondent judge from the case, alleging that:</p>

<blockquote>"Judge Union C. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> doctored the
records of this case in that he suppressed the TRUE and GENUINE proceedings had
in open Court on Feb­ruary 28, 1966 (1) that the undersigned defendant moved to
dismiss this case; (2) that this case was <span style="">set
for hearing on March 21, 1966; and (3) that the undersigned defendant was
ordered to make his motion to dismiss in writing and to set it for hear­ing
also on March 21, 1966.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>He also doctored the records by issuing an Order defending the plaintiffs,
and in which it is stated that it was given in open Court although it can no
longer be legally done, because after the case was called and the parties have
left, <span style="">as </span>this case was already
called and I had already left, the Court can no longer legally issue any order
in open Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The said <span class="SpellE">doctorings</span> of the records of
this case are serious. If they were done in the past days, then they may be
done again in the coining days, unless Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>
is disqualified to con­tinue to hear and to act on this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Order about those TRUE and GENUINE proceedings was not issued
by Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>. In other words, they were doctored
by suppressing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was in Court
on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1966</st1:date>, for a
hearing of this case, I looked at the records, and I found that there was none.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But the records were again doctored, by the issuance of an UNTRUE
and an UNGENUINE Order dated February 28, 1966, copy of which I received on
March 15, 1966, in which the plaintiffs were defended and which stated it <span style="">was </span>given in open Court, <u>although</u>
<u>after</u> a case was already called and the parties had left, the Court can
no longer legally issue an order in open Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, on that date, this case had already been called and <span style="">I had already left after a TRUE and GENUINE
order was issued in open Court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> issued the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
UNTRUE and UNGENUINE Order of <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1966</st1:date> in defense of the plaintiffs and their attorney.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So, it is conclusive that there are gross ERRORS in the Order of <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probably they were due either to gross
incompetence or that they were deliberately made so that there could be a basis
for requiring me to explain within 24 hours why I should not be cited for
contempt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But considering that more anomalies followed, there is now reason
to believe that the anomalies committed are intentional.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The foregoing series of anomalies show the evident bias and
partiality of Judge Union C. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> in favor of the
plaintiffs and against me, which will prevent him from resolving the questions
in this case with impartiality and solely on the merits.“</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 12, 1966, petitioner was again ordered by respondent
judge to explain why he should not be cited for contempt of court for
"using clearly insolent, disrespectful, and contemptuous lan­guage therein,
which insinuations or imputations are highly dero­gatory and served nothing but
to discredit the judge presiding this Court in an attempt to secure his
disqualification, considering that they have no basis in truth and in fact and
palpably unwarranted, in violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics and
Rule 71 of the Rules of Court." Petitioner's explanation was filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 26, 1966, respondent judge declared the explanation to
be unsatisfactory, adjudged petitioner in direct contempt, and sentenced the
latter to pay a fine of P100 "to be remitted to the Clerk of Court not
later than May 3, 1966", the next scheduled hearing of the case, or upon
failure or refusal to pay, to five (5) days imprisonment in the provincial
jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of this order does not
appear to have been received by petitioner before <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner registered with this Court a petition for impeachment of respondent
judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1966</st1:date>, this
Court dismissed the same for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, at the hearing of <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1966</st1:date>, respondent judge asked petitioner to withdraw
his pleading moving for re­spondent judge's disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­upon, the judge asked if petitioner was
going to pay the fine or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
informed the court that he had not received copy of any order sentencing him
for contempt and that he had a right to move for reconsideration after receipt
of a copy of such order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at this
juncture that the judge verbally ordered a guard to commit peti­tioner to jail
(according to respondent judge, he instructed the guard to detain petitioner
merely at the Office of the Warden).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was restrained of his liberty for two hours from 10:00
o'clock a.m. to 12:00 o'clock p.m., at which time the judge reconsidered his
verbal order of commitment and set petitioner free with the follow­ing order:
"Acting on the oral manifestation of defendant Atty. <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> to the effect that up to this date he has
not received the Order of this Court dated April 26, 1966, the Order of his
Commitment to the Provincial Jail at <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City is
hereby held in abeyance until after said defendant shall have received a copy
thereof and given a chance to explain why the said Order shall not be carried
out."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition to disqualify respondent judge was denied by the
latter on the same day, <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1966</st1:date>,
as follows: "It appear­ing that there is neither a legal nor moral ground
to disqualify the Presiding Judge of this Court in hearing this case, the
Petition to disqualify the trial Judge by defendant <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> is hereby denied. Reset the hearing of this
case on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1966</st1:date>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 26, 1966, following a series of pleadings, respondent
judge signed an order which in part reads:</p>

<blockquote>"x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendant, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> insists that the Presiding Judge of this Court should
not try this case for which he requests that he be given one (1) month from
today within which to file his Petition of either Cer­tiorari or Prohibition,
so that he again requests for postponement, which is not objected to by the
other counsel, if only to settle this issue once and for all and to afford said
defendant all conceivable remedies he may choose to take advantage of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless said defendant secures a restraining
order from the Supreme Court, the trial shall proceed definitely on September 6
and 9, 1966, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 A.M.</st1:time> and the Court
will not countenance any further postponement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next went to the Court of Appeals with a petition for
prohibition and mandamus with preliminary injunction,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
pray­ing, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, for the return of
Civil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Case 4871 to Branch I of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1966</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's move to reconsider was thwarted
by the Court of Appeals' resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="10">October
 10, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of
Appeals, through a reasoned resolution of <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1966</st1:date>, denied petitioner's second motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then came to this Court on <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1966</st1:date> on appeal by certiorari with a
prayer for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
gave due course on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1966</st1:date>
and directed the issuance of a preliminary injunction upon a <span style="">P1<span class="GramE">,<span style="">000</span></span></span>-bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having received the foregoing resolution on November 22, 1966,
petitioner on the same day telegraphed respondent judge asking that the case be
held in abeyance because this Court gave due course to his petition and that he
was filing the injunction bond the day following.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the receipt of the foregoing telegram, on <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1966</st1:date> respondent judge
denied postponement and directed that trial on the merits proceed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it turned out, respondent judge cancelled the succeeding
hearings he set for the case after receiving the preliminary in­junction of
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We treat the case before us as an original petition for cer­tiorari,
prohibition and mandamus. Enough averments there are in the petition and the

<p class="BODY">1. This case presents an unedifying picture of animosity,
hostility and bad blood between petitioner, a lawyer and party defendant and
cross-defendant, and respondent, a judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the events that occurred in the court below, <span style="">we </span>gather the im­pression that the
courtroom had been converted into an arena of recriminations between the
two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Opprobious</span>
language has been employed by both.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the duty of both counsel and judge to maintain, not to
destroy, the high esteem and regard for courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any act on the part of one or the other that tends to undermine the
people's res­pect for, and confidence in, the administration of justice is to
be avoided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, even if both may
have to restrain pride from taking the better part of their system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be expected then of petitioner and
respondent is a sense of shared responsibility, a crucial factor in the
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet lack
thereof is painfully apparent in the record of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear that both petitioner and
respondent were seized by a kind of ennui which immobilizes the <span style="">sense </span>of proportion of men trapped in
situa­tions where emotion runs loose.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lawyer is an officer
of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Canon I of the Canons of
Professional Ethics enjoins him "to maintain towards the Courts a
respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial
office, but for the maintenance of its supreme im­portance." When a lawyer
<span style="">goes </span>past respectful
disagreement with the judge and enters into the forbidden area of uncontrolled
criticism, he trenches upon this canon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us look into the language employed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner, in his motion to disqualify
respondent judge, charged that the latter had "suppressed the true and
genuine proceedings" and had "doctored the records" in reference
to what took place in court on February 28, 1966; that the other order of March

him to explain within 24 hours why he should not be cited for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suppression of the true and genuine proceedings is a charge
serious enough. Doctoring is no less grave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The word "doctored" connotes a deliberate act to conceal the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, the mere omission in
the order of February 28 of the facts that petitioner moved to dismiss the
case, that petitioner was ordered to make his motion to dismiss in writing, and
that the motion was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="3">March
 21, 1966</st1:date>, in our opinion, are not serious enough to warrant the use
of the word "doctored".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
thus explained by respondent judge, there was a mere mistake; there was no

have suffered exasperation at re­spondent's order to show <span class="GramE">cause</span>
why he should not be held in con­tempt of court for failure to appear at the

ideal in the relations between man and man, between lawyer and judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undignified language rarely escapes reproof
from courts of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
accordingly be but a demonstration of lack of discipline and self-restraint for
a lawyer to characterize a judge's actions with some such words as
"doctored", "fabrications" or "distortion of
truth".<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

that at the July 26 hearing, respondent judge would not give him leeway to
speak in court, interrupting him and continuing to say things against him in a
derisive tone and in a humiliating and abusive manner; that re­spondent judge
even said: <span style="">"Why

respondent judge may not be legally disqualified from hearing Civil Case 4871,
still it may not be amiss to repeat what we have said not so long ago in <u>Pimentel</u>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Salanga</u></span> (1967), 21 SCRA 160,
167-168, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"All the foregoing notwithstanding, this should be a good
occasion as any to draw attention of all judges to appropriate guidelines in a
situation where their capacity to try and decide a case fairly and judiciously
comes to the fore by way of challenge from any one of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge may not be legally prohibited from
sitting in <span class="GramE">a litigation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when suggestion is made of record that he
might be induced to act in favor of one party or with bias or prejudice against
a litigant arising out of cir­cumstances reasonably capable of inciting such a
state of mind, he should conduct a careful self-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should exercise his discretion in a way
that the people's faith in the courts of justice is not impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A salutary norm is that he <span class="GramE">reflect</span>
on the probability that a losing party might nurture at the back of his mind
the thought that the judge had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span> tilted
the scales of justice against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
passion on the part of a judge may be generated because of serious charges of
misconduct against him by a suitor or his counsel, is not altogether
remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a man, subject to the
frailties of other men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should,
therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to act or
withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could in good grace inhibit himself where
that case could be heard by another judge and where no appre­ciable prejudice
would be occasioned to others involved therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the result of his decision to sit or not to sit may depend to a great
extent the all-important confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If after reflection he should resolve to
voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where his motives or fairness might
be seriously impugned, his action is to be interpreted as giving meaning and
substance to the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He serves the cause of the law who forestalls
miscar­riage of justice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Very recently, on <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="5">May 6,
 1969</st1:date>, in <u>Buenaventura</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bene­dicto</u></span>,
Administrative Case 137, we resolved the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon consideration of the motion for recon­sideration praying
that the resolution of this Court of January 29, 1969 be reconsidered and that
re­spondent judge be ordered to inhibit himself from hearing Civil Case No. 300
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and considering that the issues in said Civil Case
No. 300 apparently are the same as those in Criminal Case No. 420, re­spondent's
actuations in which is the subject of the present administrative case, and
while tech­nically, respondent judge may not be compelled to inhibit himself
from sitting in the trial of Civil Case No. 300 upon the provisions of Section
1 of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court; but that nonethe­less having in mind that <u>a</u>

whatever action may be taken by the respondent judge in said Civil Case No. 300
may be subject to interpretation <u>not</u> <u>conducive</u> <u>to</u> <u>faith</u>

its view that <u>the</u> <u>ends</u> <u>of</u> <u>justice</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>will</u> <u>be</u> <u>better</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>subserved</u></span> if respondent judge should inhibit himself
from hearing Civil. Case No. 300 afore­said."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All suitors, we must say, are entitled to nothing short of the
cold neutrality of an independent, wholly-free, disinterested and impartial
tribunal.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been said that "next in importance to the duty of rendering a

suspicion of the fairness and integrity of the judge." <a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Let it not be said that the administration of justice in this country suffers
from too many human imperfections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
our mind, respondent judge should inhibit himself since it has become apparent
that his further continuance in Case 4871 would not be in the best interests of
justice, which he is bound to serve.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But consideration of
the petition herein does not end here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is the order of respondent judge of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1966</st1:date> - issued <u>after</u> the herein
petition was lodged with this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said order came about thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1966</st1:date>, this Court gave
due course to the present petition, directed that <span style="">a </span>cease-­and-desist order issue upon a P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>-bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of this reso­lution reached petitioner
only on November 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same day,
November 22, petitioner wired respondent judge informing the latter that the
herein petition was given due course and that he would file the necessary
injunction bond the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
telegram reads: "Respectfully reiterate motion hold abeyance hearing Case
No. 4871, <span class="SpellE">Ilaw</span> et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ona</span>,

Stop injunction bond filed tomorrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span>,
Defendant." It will be recalled that respondent judge received the
telegram on November 23.</p>

<p class="BODY">He held sessions on that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he received that telegram from petitioner, caution should have
suggested to respondent to first ascertain from this Court as to whether or not
the petition herein was really given due course and injunction granted if he
doubted the veracity of the telegram.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right away, he
disbelieved petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here is what respondent judge in part said in his order of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1966</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"After hearing the views of counsel for the plaintiffs and for
other defendants as well as cross-claimant in connection with the Petition for
Cer­tiorari filed by defendant Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">B</span>aldomero</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span> before the
Supreme Court on November 14, 1966, as well as his pleading entitled 'Special
Appearance to Move for Holding Hearing in Abeyance', received on November 22,
1966, coupled with the telegram he sent which we received only today
reiterating his motion to hold in abeyance again the hearing of this case on the
alleged ground that the Supreme Court gave due course to the petition without
furnishing us a copy of the order, the Court is of the considered opinion that
in order to protect the interests of all concerned who are desirous to
terminate this case as soon as practicable since it has been pending way back
in April, 1948, and to assert the dignity of the Court, we are constrained to
proceed to the trial on the merits after several postponements at the behest of
defendant Atty. <span class="SpellE">Luque</span>, evidently intended as dila­tory
tactics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We share the view of all
counsel that the petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court without
including the Court of Appeals as co-re­spondent is patently irregular, and we
have grave doubts whether the Supreme Court, with due res­pect, will give this
petition due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, since
there is no restraining order from a higher court, as previously understood,
and if only to appear consistent to our repeated orders that we shall not countenance
any further post­ponement, there is no course of action left for us to take but
to proceed to trial in the exercise of our discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This order of November 23 is plainly indicative of the judge's
frame of mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evidence that
petitioner has not merely fallen in his disfavor; respondent judge had by then
formed a hardened idea that petitioner is incapable of telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge should have taken stock of
the fact that petitioner, besides being an attorney, <u>is</u> <u>also</u> <u>a</u>
<u>party</u> <u>defendant and</u> <u>cross</u>-<u>defendant</u> in Civil Case
4871.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fate of that case mainly
hinges upon whether or not the compromise agreement entered into in Civil Cases
Nos. 6 and 26 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
were obtained through duress and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is quite reasonable to assume that the petitioner as defendant in the
case before respondent judge would take the stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, counsel had a hand in that compromise
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, too, must meet
the evidence against him on the cross-complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it far-fetched then to say that if Case
4871 is to be heard before respondent judge, there is a great pro­bability that
His Honor would not give petitioner's testimony the credit that normally should
be given to it?</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual setting of the present case goes beyond that in <u>Pimentel</u>
<u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Salanga</u></span>, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, petitioner, counsel in a number of
cases, sought the judge's disqualification in said cases, because <u>counsel </u>was
complainant in an administrative case against respondent judge upon averments
of "serious misconduct, inefficiency in office, partiality, ignorance of
the law and incompetence."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, complainant is not merely an attorney but also a defendant and
cross-defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Pimentel</u>,
“[n]o act or conduct of his (respondent judge) would show arbitrariness or
prejudice."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
There, whether or not petitioner's clients would get a fair trial was still in
the speculative stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the case
went farther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's prejudice
against a suitor has concretely manifested itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The animosity between respondent judge and
petitioner, a party to the case below, had developed through a long period of
time, become patent in the order of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1966</st1:date>, and is even evident in this case before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By now, it is quite difficult to take out of
petitioner's mind the impression that he cannot get a fair trial from
respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances presented, we are constrained to state that
respondent's taking cognizance of said case does not square with our sense of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be stressed once again
that parties have a right to have their cases tried fairly by an impartial
tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is because of all of these that we rule that it would be a
grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent judge to further take
cognizance of Civil Case 4871.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But another reason as
potent exists why respondent judge should not be insulated from the charge of
abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of Case 4871.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is that respondent judge got hold of that
case under circumstances which were far from regular.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it must be conceded that respondent judge of Branch IV
had authority to hold court in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for the pur­pose of trying all
kinds of cases and entering judgments therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the fact is that Case 4871 had been <u>previously</u> assigned and
belonged to Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the
formal notice to the parties for the hearing scheduled for <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1965</st1:date>, in plain terms, states that
"the above-entitled case will be heard in the <u>1st</u> <u>Branch</u> of
this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
But when the case came up for hearing on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1965</st1:date>, this Case 4871 no longer appeared in
the calendar of cases corresponding to Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are confronted by informa­tion put forward
by petitioner in his reply to respondent's answer, dated December 24, 1966
(which was made complete on January 4, 1967), that on November 5, 1965,
"Judge Valero did not fail to report, but on the contrary, he reported
early on November 5, 1965 in his Branch I in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
City and <u>he</u> <u>called</u> <u>up</u> <u>a</u> <u>high</u> <u>pile</u> <u>of</u>
<u>cases</u> <u>that</u> <u>day</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
He appended as Annex A to his printed memorandum filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1967</st1:date>, a certification coming from
Deputy Clerk Pedro B. <span class="SpellE">Zara</span> that "Hon. Gabriel V.
Valero held Court sessions on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November
 5, 1965</st1:date> at the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Capital of this province." In the face of these averments, we find
respondent judge standing mute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
made no effort to deny that Judge Gabriel Valero was in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1965</st1:date> hearing
cases for Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had two
opportunities to deny the same before us, after petitioner twice - once in
petitioner's said reply and then on pages 24-25 of his printed memorandum -
represented this point of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judge waived his right to oral argument and to the submission of his
memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he did not refute the
proffered fact just mentioned we consider very significant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have to give due credence to petitioner's assertion of fact
not only because it is <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> on record and
supported by an official certification, but also because it is corroborated by
the narration of facts given by the attorney for the other side - the
plaintiffs - in the case below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will
be recalled that, as earlier stated, plaintiffs' attorney carne to court that
day - Novem­ber 5, 1965 - and found that Case 4871 was not included in the list
of cases to be heard by Branch I but was included in the calendar of "the
other <span class="SpellE">sala</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implicit from the foregoing is that on Novem­ber 5 there was a list of
cases for Branch I which did <u>not</u> include Case 4871, as should be the
case, for Case 4871 properly belonged to Branch I.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the explanation given by respondent judge
does not appear to be reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
contrary to the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It surely is not
in keeping with the sound administration of justice for a judge of a branch of
a court to take for himself a case belong­ing to another branch of the same
court without justifiable reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a procedure breeds confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could even be suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It opens up a charge such as here presented
that respondent has demonstrated "unusual interest" in this case and
refused to return it to Branch I <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of
petitioner's move for the purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>
