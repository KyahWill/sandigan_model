				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the order of the Court of First <span style="">Instance of Manila (Branch I), dated March 5,
1965, denying the motion of Ramon E. Saura, former First Receiver of the World
War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. (hereinafter re­ferred to merely as WARVETS),
asking for reimbursement of the sum of P5, 236.00, representing the amount
which he al­legedly paid in advance as compensation to a clerk whose services
he availed of while he was still a receiver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September </span>6,
1960, <span style="">appellant was appointed receiver
of the WARVETS by the lower court in Civil Case No. </span>34998<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">"generally to do and perform such
acts respecting the pro­perty, assets and transactions" of the
organization "as the court may authorize".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon filing a bond in the sum of fifty thousand
(P50, 000.00) pesos, he entered upon the dis­charge of his functions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During his term,
appellant went to Japan by authority of the lower court's order dated October
12, 1960 for the purpose of checking on the reported undervaluation of goods
shipped to the WARVETS and of preparing the shipment of the goods which had not
yet been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For expenses in­curred
by him during this trip, which amounted to P9, 431.48, he was ordered
reimbursed by the lower court on June 5, 1963.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The
order authorizing reimbursement stated thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“</span>x x x The order
permits the claim for reimbursement as part of the receiver's compensation as
such receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not prohibit the
reimbursement of the expenses before the payment of the receiver's compen­sation,
and it <span style="">is </span>only fair and just
that at least the expenses which the receiver advanced, if found reason­able <span style="">and necessary, be reimbursed as soon as the
funds of the WARVETS per­mit."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Except for this
reimbursed amount, appellant received no other fee or compensation from the
WARVETS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, for a continuous
period of three (3) years, he performed his duties as receiver without
receiving any compensation as such.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on October 9, 1963, he filed a motion in </span>the <span style="">lower court to fix not only his compensation
but also that of his co-receiver, Macario Ofilada.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In his motion, he prayed further for such
amounts as attorney's fees and stenographer's fees as the court may allow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an oppo­sition thereto had been duly
interposed, the lower court issued an "Omnibus Order" on January 22,
1964, the second paragraph of which denied the motion of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A re­consideration of the order of denial was
immediately sought by appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Without awaiting action
on his motion for reconsider­ation, appellant filed another motion, on May 28,
1964, re­signing from his post </span>as <span style="">receiver
and praying that the low­er court accept it and at the same time fix the amount
of his fees and compensation as receiver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 5, 1964,
appellant was discharged as receiver and his compensation was fixed at
P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the lower court
approving his discharge reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Ramon E. Saura, first receiver, filed in his own behalf on
May 28, 1964, his motion to withdraw as first receiver and for fixing of his
compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There be­ing no objection
to this withdrawal, the same <span style="">is </span>hereby
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respecting his <span style="">compensation, neither is there object­ion
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, per joint mo­tion
filed on May 28, by defendants, except Filipinas Merchandising, which has been
granted, they asked the withdrawal of their joint motion dated March 31, 1961,
for the removal of Saura as receiver; and per manifesta­tion of said defendants
except Fili­pinas Merchandising dated May 28, they recommend P10, 000.00 as
Saura's fee, which Jose and Susana Cochingyan are willing to advance for the
account of WARVETS.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, Ramon E.<span style=""> S</span>aura's
with­drawal as receiver in this case is hereby approved, and his fee as such is
hereby fixed at Pl0, 000.00, which Jose and Susana Cochingyan shall ad­vance
for the account of WARVETS."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently, one Atty.
Anacleto Magno, on his own behalf, presented before the lower court a motion
dated August 18, 1964, for the payment of attorney's fees to him in the amount
of P10, 000.00 for his alleged services as legal counsel for the appellant when
he was still a receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant,
himself, filed another motion for the payment and cancellation of his
receiver's bond and for the reimbursement to him of the sum of P2, 030.00 which
he paid out of his personal funds as premium for said bond from September 9,
1960 to September 9, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September
24, 1964, the lower court disposed of both motions in one order by allowing
compensation to Atty. Magno in the reduced amount of P1, 000.00 and granting re­imbursement
to appellant in the </span>whole <span style="">sum
prayed for by him as premium on his bond.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In granting fee to the coun­sel of appellant, the lower court: said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The motion, to the mind of the Court, is not well taken,
because Ramon E. Saura is himself a lawyer and he did not have to retain legal
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he did, the matter should be
for his own account, particularly because it was a unilateral act on Saura's
part to get Magno as his lawyer in the receivership.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless, the Court is not un­aware that Atty. Magno did
in fact work for Saura, for the former appeared in Court and signed pleadings
for Saura as <span style="">receiver. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, in fairness to Atty. Magno, it is hereby ordered
that he be paid '1,000.00 from the funds under receivership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he is not satisfied with this amount, he
can go after Saura."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Barely two months after the issuance of the last-mentioned order,
or on November 18, 1964, appellant filed another motion for reimbursement, this
time for the amount he allegedly paid as compensation of a clerk whom he em­ployed
when he was still a receiver for the period Septem­ber 9, 1960 to May 28, 1964,
inclusive, at the rate of P120.00 a month, or the total sum of P5, 236.00.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant alleged that in view of the
voluminous paper and legal work which he had to attend to as receiver, it was
neces­sary for him to engage the service of a typist-stenogra­pher, one Melchor
C. Ordoño, who doubled as messenger, filing clerk, utility clerk and records
clerk.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 5, 1965, although no party registered any objection to
appellant's last motion for reimbursement, the lower court denied it in the
appealed order, reasoning thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The record shows that the Court had previously ordered the
payment of P10, 000.00 as compensation for Ramon E. Saura for his services as
first receiver in this case. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Therefore,
whatever amount he now seeks in addi­tion thereto would be improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, he is now estopped from claim­ing
any further amount as compensa­tion for alleged clerical services employed by
him as such receiver without prior approval or authority of this Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lone contention of appellant in this appeal is that the lower
court committed an error in holding that he is not entitled to reimbursement of
the salaries paid by him to his clerk as receiver of the WARVETS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the other parties filed any brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">A receiver is a representative of the court appointed for the
purpose of preserving and conserving the <span style="">property
in litigation and prevent its possible destruction or dissipation, if it were
left, in the possession of any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The receiver is not the representative of any of the parties but of all
of them to the end that their in­terests may be equally protected with the
least possible inconvenience and expense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is inherent in the office of a receiver not only that </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">should act at all times with the diligence and prudence of a good
father of a family but should also not incur any obligation or expenditure
without leave of the court and it is the responsibility of the court to
supervise the receiver and see to it that he ad­heres to the above standard of
his trust and limits the expenses of the receivership to the minimum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For these rea­sons, it is generally the
receivership court that is in a better position to determine whether a
particular expendi­ture is reasonable and justified or not and its ruling
thereon may not be disturbed by this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in the case at bar, the motion in question of the
receiver was not opposed by any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be observed, however, that the records show that the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> had previously allowed or ap­proved reimbursements to the receiver
of expenditures made by him in connection with the performance of his duties,
more particularly, for a trip made to Japan and for the fees of a lawyer who
had allegedly assisted him, notwith­standing, he is a lawyer himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> fixed
the total compensation to the appellant receiver at P10, 000.00 for his
services as such and said amount, from all appearances, is agreeable to
everyone, including appel­lant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The receivership court's reasons for withholding approval of the
reimbursement in question are precisely because "whatever amount he (the
receiver) now seeks in addition thereto (P10, 000) would be improper.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he is now estopped from claiming
any further amount as compensation for alleged clerical services employed
by-him as such receiver without prior approval or authority of this
Court." We find these reasons to be cogent enough in the premises,
specially because appellant's alleged employment of a clerk was made without
prior leave of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these
circumstances, it cannot be said that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> abused its
discretion, much less gravely.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order appealed from is affirmed, with costs
against appellant.</p>

This is a case filed on January 23, 1958 by Pilar Nor­mandy, in her own behalf and
of others similarly situa­ted as well as of the WARVETS against the defendants
Calixto Duque, Claro P. Lizardo, Florencio Selga, Al­berto Ramos, Manuel
Buenafe and the Filipinas Merchan­dising Corporation, to set aside the
contracts of Octo­ber 22 and November 25, 1957 entered into between the latter
corporation and the WARVETS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allowed as
inter­venors were the spouses Susana and Jose Cochingyan, Sr. Lorenzo B.
Camins, who was later joined in as party-plaintiff, petitioned for the
appointment of a receiver, which petition was granted by the lower court after
finding facts sufficient to warrant said appointment, to wit:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"From an examination of the
records, it appears that at its meeting on August 1957, the Cabinet approved
the proposal of the World War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. to undertake the
procurement and sale of specific items of reparation goods from Japan, valued
at $8,000,000.00, in order to gene­rate trust funds for the benefit of
veterans, war widows and orphans as contemplated in the Repara­tions Agreement
between the Philippines and Japan and as provided for in Republic Act No.
1789.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on November 4, 1957, the
World War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. entered into a Joint Account Agreement
(Annex D) with the spouses Susana and Jose Cochingyan, Sr., doing business
under the name and style of the Catholic Church Mart, where<span style=""> </span>by <span style="">the latter was given the right to dispose of the reparation goods
aforementioned of the total value of $8,000,000.00, with marginal profits of
40% on non-unclassified goods and 60% on unclassi­fied items in favor of the
former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"Likewise, and at almost the
same time, that is, on October 22, and November 25, 1957, the aforementioned
World War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. entered into the two contracts in
question (Annexes E and F) with the Filipinas Merchandising <span style="">Corporation whereby the latter was allowed to
negotiate the sale and distribution of the same reparation goods valued at
$2,000,000.00 and $6,000,000.00 </span><span style="">with
</span><span style="">marginal profits of 15% and 20%
respectively, in favor of the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"By reason of these
overlapping con­tracts, Susana and Jose Cochingyan, Sr. filed a specific
performance suit against the World War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. being
Civil Case No. 34392 of this Court, with damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this case was sub­sequently
dismissed after the World War <span style="">II </span>Veterans
Enterprises, Inc., the Filipinas Merchandising Corporation, and Susana and Jose
Cochingyan, Sr. executed on February 2, 1959, a Memorandum of Settlement and
Deed of Assignment whereby the Filipinas Merchandising Corporation, for a
considera­tion, assigned to and relinquished in favor of the Cochingyans all
its rights and pri­vileges under its two contracts aforestated (Annexes E and
F), and whereby the World War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. agreed to receive
greatly reduced marginal profits, from the Cochingyans, of 20% and 25% on
non-unclassified and unclassified items respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as a result of the con­fusion that
resulted in the execution of these various contracts, the ultimate bene­ficiaries,
namely, the veterans, war widows and orphans, would suffer losses equivalent to
a decrease or reduction in expected pro­fits, from 40% and 60% assigned under
the contract with the Cochingyans of November 4, 1957 (Annex D) to 20% and 25%
under the Memorandum of Settlement dated February 2, 1959, or roughly
P3,400,000.00 to P6,600,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">"<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It cannot be said that the
original profits of 40% and 60% assigned under the contract with the
Cochingyans of November 4, 1957 (Annex D), would be hard to realize, for it is
common knowledge that imported goods command very high prices much above their
procurement costs, and because the Cochingyans would not have sacrificed time,
energy and expenses in filing their performance suit, Civil Case No. 34392 of
this Court, against the World War II Veterans Enterprises, Inc. had they not
been sure that they could easily obtain those percentage gains and at the same
time make a safe margin of profits for themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As things now stand, the interest of the
beneficiaries cannot be amply protected by the World War II Veterans
Enterprises, Inc. which naturally feels bound to support its com­mitment under
the Memorandum of Settle­ment aforementioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"For the above reasons, the
Court considers the petition for the appoint­ment of a receiver to be well
founded, and the same is, therefore, hereby granted."</p>
