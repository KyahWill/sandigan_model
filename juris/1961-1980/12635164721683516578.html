due trial the court, on May 20, 1955, rendered, judgment in favor of
petitioners.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nator</span>
and Talon appealed to the Court of Appeals (C.A.-G.R. No. 16861).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this appeal was pending the Court of
Appeals was informed about the loss by fire of the stenographic notes of the
testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">result, on September 24, 1958, the case was
remanded to the court a quo <u>for retrial</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter, however, instead of retrying the case, issued on August 10,
1958 the following order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After hearing the arguments of the plaintiffs and it

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiffs
in the </span><span style="">case
</span><span style="">(petitioners
herein) assailed the above order in a petition for mandamus and prohibition
filed with Us on September 29, 1958 (G. R. L-14368) to compel the judge of the
court a quo <u>to retry</u> the case, as he had been ordered to do by a higher
court; to restrain him from rendering any decision upon the evidence taken
anew, and instead to transmit such evidence to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition, however, was dismissed because </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">held that appeal in due time from the order of
dismissal was the proper remedy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Due to the foregoing
circumstances, petitioners herein (plaintiffs in </span><span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Case No. 3238) filed a claim with the Court of Industrial Relations on
December 5, 1958, against <span class="SpellE">Nator</span> and Talon (Case No.
22-V <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>) also for underpayment of wage
differentials under the Minimum Wage Law, overtime pay, separation pay for
having dismissed without due notice and cause, actual and moral damages and
attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nator</span>
and Talon filed separate answers wherein, after specifically denying material
averments of the claim, interposed the following special defenses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) lack of cause of action; (b) prescription
of the several causes of action making up the claim; and bar by prior judgment
based on the order of dismissal issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-3238 and by the
dismissal of the action for mandamus and prohibition (G.R. No.</span> L-14368)
- both mentioned heretofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Talon
likewise interposed a counter-claim for P2<span class="GramE">,500</span> for
moral damages and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due hearing, the
Court of Industrial Relations rendered judgment in favor of the claimants as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

complexities of the already long delayed case, we said the following, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under the above set of facts, therefore, it is clear that
respondents’ causes of action are legally maintainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>

controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, in

<p class="2Q">'Under the law and jurisprudence the Court of Industrial Relations’
jurisdiction extends only to cases involving (a) labor disputes affecting an
industry which is indispensable to the national interest and so certified by
the President to the Court (Sec. 10, Rep. Act No. 875); (b) con<span style="">troversy about the
minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, Rep. Act No. 602; (c) hours of
employment, under the Eight Hour Labor Practice (Sec. 5/a. Rep. Act No. </span><span style="">87</span><span style="">5</span><span style="">), a</span><span style="">nd such disputes, to fall under the jurisdiction of the CIR, must arise
while the employer-employee relationship between the parties exists or the
employee seeks reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When such
relationship is over and the employee does not seek reinstatement all claims
become money claims that fall under the jurisdiction of the regular Courts (<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Huan</span> v. Judge Bautista, et

connection with C.A.-G.R. No. 16861-R (appeal from the decision of the Court of

status of the above-entitled case, whether it has considered the above-entitled

course which had been given to the defendants-appellants appeal shall be
resumed.'</blockquote>

</span>The Court RESOLVED to deny the said motion, this case having been
dismissed by this Court in its resolution of Jan. 26, 1960 and the same was
remanded on Jan. 20, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From
the above resolution it appears that CA-G.R. L-16861 had been dismissed by the
Court of Appeals since January 26, 1960, the reasons therefore not appearing of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Going
back now to the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
dismissing the case <u>remanded to it for retrial</u>, it appears that on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, herein petitioners
filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari against said court
assailing the validity of said order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, by resolution of August 3 of the same year the Court of Appeals
dismissed said action upon the ground that the main case CA-G.R. No. 16861-R
was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According
to the foregoing the real issue before Us now is whether or not the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> erred in dismissing Civil Case
R-3238 of its docket (Appealed to the Court of Appeals as G.R. 16861) remanded
to it by the Court of Appeals for <u>retrial</u> in accordance with its
resolution of February 24, 1958 in CA-G.R. 16861; and whether or not the Court
of Appeals likewise erred in dismissing the aforesaid case CA-G.R. 16861 as per
its resolution of January 26, 1960.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After a careful review of the record and the
complicated circumstances involved, we have arrived at the conclusion that both
courts erred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> erred because under
the resolution of the Court of Appeals of February 24, 1958 and our decision in
G.R. No. L-16671 of March 30, 1962, it had absolutely no authority and no
discretion to dismiss the case remanded to it expressly for the purpose of
conducting the "hearing as ordered by the Court of Appeals in the
resolution dated February 24, 1958, in case CA-G.R. No. 16861-R for the purpose
of retaking the portions of the testimonies in the case which were lost, after
which to forward the same to the Court of Appeals for decision".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its only duty, therefore, was to retake the
testimony of the witnesses the stenographic notes of whose testimonies had been
lost by fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of doing this, it
dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly,
the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the case G.R. 16861 when it should
have ordered the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to
proceed to retry the case under the conditions heretofore mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both courts, in this manner, </span><span style="">rendered nugatory and virtually set aside our
decision in G. R. L-16671.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that both orders of dismissal are void end of
no legal effect whatsoever.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition under consideration alleges - and this has not been
denied by respondents - that subsequent and pursuant to our decision in G. R.
No. L-16671, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> took
the testimonies and other evidence presented by the opposing parties and
thereafter elevated the record to the Court of Appeals to enable the latter to
decide CA-G.R. No. 16861-R, but that the Clerk of said Court returned the
record to the court of origin on the ground that said appealed case had already
been dismissed by the Court of Appeals in its resolutions of January 16 and 26,
1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having arrived at the conclusion
that the aforesaid resolutions are void and of no legal effect whatsoever, it
is clear that it is now the duty of the Court of appeals to act accordingly in
the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) setting aside and declaring void the
resolutions of the Court of Appeals complained of in the petition under
consideration; (b) ordering said court to reinstate the case known as CA-G.R.
No. 16861, and thereafter, after proper proceedings, to render judgment
therein.</p>
