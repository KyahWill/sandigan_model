				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The only issue of law raised in this appeal from an Order of the
Court of First Instance of Manila is:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>where plaintiff obtained judgment in the Municipal Court against
defendant who in turn ob­tained judgment for reimbursement against the
third-party-defen­dant, but only the latter appealed to the Court of First
Instance, may plaintiff's judgment against defendant be deemed to have become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">In a collection action instituted in the City Court of Manila,
defendant in the course of the presentation of his evidence, obtained leave to
file a third-party complaint against the third-party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After proper proceedings, the City Court
rendered judgment on the original complaint in favor of plaintiff, and on the
third-party complaint in favor of defendant, as third-party plaintiff, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiff and against the defendant Fernando <span class="SpellE">Tempongko</span>,
ordering the latter to pay the former the sum of P1,992.40, representing the
principal account, plus P200.00 stipulated interest up to Jan­uary 31, 1964 and
1% interest per month from Feb­ruary, 1964, until the principal and interest
are fully paid; ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P400.00
as and for attorney's fees; and the costs of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the third party complaint, judgment is hereby rendered in favor
of the third party plaintiff and against the third party defendant, ordering
the latter to pay the former whatever amount the said third party plaintiff is
ordered to pay the plaintiff in this case; plus an additional sum of P200.00 as
and for attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The third party defendant's counter claim is hereby dismissed.
" (Rec. on Appeal, pp. 3-4)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only the third-party defendant appealed in due course from the
judgment rendered against him in the third-party complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the records were elevated to the Court of First Instance of
Manila, plaintiff filed a Motion to Remand Case to the lower court, for
execution of its judgment against defendant, alleging in substance that by
virtue of defendant's failure to appeal, its judgment against defendant had
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and was in no way affected
by the appeal filed by third party defendant from the judgment in favor of
defendant in the third-party com­plaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First instance overruled defendant's opposition to
plaintiff's motion and issued an Order granting the motion for the remand of
the case to the City Court for execution of its de­cision against defendant, directing
that thereafter the records be sent back to it 'for trial de novo insofar as
the third party plaintiff and the third party defendant are concerned."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Order of execution is the challenged order before this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant and third-party plaintiff-appellant's appeal is without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main prop of his appeal that
"(T)he appellant's third party complaint is in effect a defense to the
plaintiff's complaint against him" and that "the intimate connection
of the issues involved in the principal complaint and in the third-party
complaint …. is sufficient to enable the herein appellant to ventilate before
the Court of First Instance his own case without the need of appealing from
that aspect of the decision which dir­ectly imposes upon him the liability to
pay the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is bereft of legal support or basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court a quo, therefore, correctly issued its order for
execution of the judgment on the principal complaint in favor of plaintiff on
the strength of this Court's ruling in Singh vs. Liberty Insurance Corporation<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, this Court
similarly disposed of an identical case:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant admits that it did not appeal from the decision of
the Municipal Court but contends that the appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
taken by the third party defendants inured to its benefit; that said appeal
vacated the decision not only as far as the third party defendants were
concerned but also with respect to the defendant, al­though it did not appeal;
that on appeal the case should be tried <u>de novo</u> as if it had never been
tried before, and finally, that being an <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
itself because of the judgment in its favor against the third party defendants,
it did not have to appeal from the decision of the Mun­icipal Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is true, as appellant claims that an appeal from the
decision of an inferior court (Municipal Court) operates to vacate said
decision, thereafter the case to stand trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> in the Court
of First Instance, but it seems obvious that this applies only to the party who
had taken the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As against other
parties adversely affected by the decision who did not appeal, the decision
must be deemed to have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary view would lead to indefensible
results."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Our conclusions, therefore, are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, that because the defendant Liberty
Insurance Corporation did not appeal from the adverse decision of the Municipal
Court, it had no right to file the answer in question, and second, that the
decision of the Municipal Court having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
as against said defendant, its execution was in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, said defendant is still
an active party in the appealed case because of the appeal taken by the
third-party defendants from the decision of the Municipal Court in so far as it
was in favor of said defendant as third party plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A brief discussion of the Rule on third-party complaints and of
the nature and object thereof suffices to show the rationale <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 6, section 12 defines a third-party complaint as follows: -</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Third-party complaint</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- A third-party complaint is a claim that a
defending party may, with leave of court, file against a person not a party to
the action, called the third-party defendant, for contribution, indemnity,
subrogation or any other relief, in respect of his opponent's claim."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The third-party complaint, is therefore, a procedural device
whereby a “third party” who is neither a party nor privy to the act or deed
complained of by the plaintiff, may be brought into the case with leave of
court, by the defendant, who acts as third party plaintiff to enforce against
such third-party defendant a right for contribution, indemnity, subrogation or
any other relief, in res­pect of the plaintiff's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third party complaint is actually
independent of and separate and distinct from the plaintiff's com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for this provision of the Rules
of Court, it would have to be filed independently and separately from the
original complaint by the defendant against the third party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Rules permit defendant to bring in a
third party defendant or so to speak, to litigate his separate cause of action
in respect of plaintiff's claim against a third party in the original and princi­pal
case with the object of avoiding circuitry of action and unnece­ssary
proliferation of lawsuits and of disposing expeditiously in one litigation the
entire subject matter arising from one particu­lar set of facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Prior leave of Court is necessary, so that where the allowance of a third party
complaint would delay the resolution of the original case, such as when the
third-party defendant cannot be located<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or where matters extraneous to the issue of possession would unnecessarily
clutter a case of forcible entry,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
or the effect would be to introduce a new and separate controversy into the
action,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the salutary object of the rule would not be defeated, and the court should in
such cases require the defendant to institute a separate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When leave to file the third party complaint
is properly granted, the Court renders in effect two judgments in the same
case, one on the plaintiff's com­plaint and the other on the third party
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he finds favorably on
both complaints, as in this case, he renders judgment on the principal complaint
in favor of plaintiff against defendant and renders another judgment on the
third party complaint in favor of defendant as third party plaintiff, ordering
the third party defendant to reimburse the defendant whatever amount said
defendant is ordered to pay plaintiff in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure of any of said parties in such a case
to appeal the judgment as against him makes such judgment final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the
same token, an appeal by one party from such judgment does not inure to the
benefit of the other party who has not appealed nor can it be deemed to be an
appeal of such other party from the judgment against him.</p>

of the decision of the City Court of Manila in favor of plain­tiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as against defendant-appellant is hereby
