				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A decision by the then lower court Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
V. Vasquez, subsequently a Justice of the Court of Appeals, now retired,
convicting <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span>
for violation of the Anti-Subversion <span class="GramE">Act,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is assailed in this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
principal contention is that such a statute is unconstitutional for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>post</u> <u>facto</u> and freedom<span style=""> </span>of speech and assembly
guarantees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our decision in People v. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>upholding its validity had <span class="GramE">foreclosed</span> that question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last two errors assigned in the appeal deal with the alleged failure
of the evidence to demonstrate the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful scrutiny of the
decision as well as the records of the case easily reveals the <span class="GramE">weakness</span> of such a submission, the evidence being more than
sufficient to demonstrate the culpability of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Affirmance</span> is <span style="">thus </span>indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts may be culled from the well-written decision of the
then Judge Vasquez:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The evidence
presented in this case consisted almost wholly of that presented by the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the prosecution
rested, the accused waived the presentation of any testimonial evidence in his
behalf, and rested the case upon presentation and admission of Exhibits 1 to 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquiry in this case becomes, therefore,
a determination of whether or not the prosecution has complied with the
two-witness rule requirement for conviction of the accused for the offenses
with which he is charged in the above quoted information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the membership of the accused <span style="">in </span>the Communist Party of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is concerned, the record contains an express admission by the accused of such
membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one of the hearings of
this case held on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1962</st1:date>,
the accused asked the Court's permission to read a written petition for
postponement which he was allowed to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The written petition was then submitted and made a part of the
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the accused refused to
sign the same, it was marked as Exhibit C for the prosecution and adopted as
Exhibit 2 for the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads in part:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'I am asking for the postponement of the
trial until after the Supreme Court renders decision on the constitutionality
of Republic Act 1700.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Act is
voided the case is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, if the constitutionality of Republic Act 1700 is upheld then all
that this court had to do is pass judgment because <u>I am<span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">not denying my member</span><span style="">ship
</span>in my Party which this Court could interpret as the same party that is
outlawed by Republic Act 1700</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
either case, all concerned will be saved the trouble of a long trial.' * * * It
could thus be seen from the above document presented by the accused himself
that he admits his membership in the party which was outlawed by Republic Act. <span class="GramE">No. 1700.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider­ing
that this manifestation was made on <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="2">February
 15, 1962</st1:date>, it also constitutes an admission that such membership was
after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No. 1700, which
was approved on <st1:date year="1957" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said membership was also shown by the
testimonies of a host of witnesses presented by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The overt acts committed by the accused on
which at least two witnesses of the prosecution testified to are the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The conference of the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> at <span class="SpellE">Telabastagan</span>, a barrio
near Angeles, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in the first week of March,
1958; (2) the armed encounter between government troops and the dissident group
headed by the accused in the same place in the last week of March, 1958; and
(3) the conference of the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> held in barrio <span class="SpellE">Biak-na-Bato</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
in mid-November of 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conference
of the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> in the sugarcane fields at <span class="SpellE">Telabastagan</span> in the first week of March, 1958 was testified
to by prosecution witnesses Ricardo Mendoza, Juan <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They testified that they were in group of <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>
that stayed at barrio <span class="SpellE">Telabastagan</span>; that in the first
week of March, 1958, a conference was held thereat; that present in the
conference were the accused who presided the same, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>,
Linda <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>, Davidson, <span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span>,
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Dabu</span>, and others; that the conference lasted
three or four days; and that these witnesses acted as guards around the place
where the conference was held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conference at <span class="SpellE">Biak-na-Bato</span>, San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in November of 1957, was testified to by
prosecution witnesses [<span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>] Esteban and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> [<span class="SpellE">Aquesa</span>] who both declared
that they were former <span class="SpellE">Huks</span>; that they were assigned
as security guards in the conference held at <span class="SpellE">Biak-na-Bato</span>
in November, 1957; that present in the conference were [<span class="SpellE">Casto</span>]
<span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>,
Linda <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>, Davidson, and others; and that the
conference lasted about two days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
encounter between the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> and government forces at <span class="SpellE">Telabastagan</span> in the last week of March, 1958 had been
testified to by prosecution witnesses Ricardo Mendoza, Juan <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They similarly declared that the accused led one of the groups of <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> that participated in that encounter that the exchange
of shots with government troops lasted for about thirty minutes; that the
accused carried two firearms on that occasion, namely, an automatic carbine and
a German <span class="SpellE">Luger</span> pistol which he used in firing in the
direction of the government forces; and that the accused exhorted his men to
fight."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the question of the validity of the Anti-Subversion Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very extensive opinion of the late Chief

susceptible to the reproach of its being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of
the constitutional guarantees of prohibiting an <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u>
legislation as well as the respect to be accorded freedom of expression and

<p class="NUM">2. Nor is there any substance to the allegation in the last two

who admitted that they were former <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> declared that
they were assigned as security guards in the conference held at<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Biak-na-Bato</span> </span>in
November, 1957 and that appellant <span class="SpellE">Casto</span> <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> was among those present at such
conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lasted about two
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as the encounter between
the <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> and the government forces at <span class="SpellE">Telabastagan</span> in the last week of March, 1958 is concerned,
the evidence of record discloses the testimony of prosecution witnesses Ricardo

There is, therefore, proof, to quote from the decision "that the accused
led one of the groups of <span class="SpellE">Huks</span> that participated in
that encounter that the exchange of shots with troops lasted for about thirty
minutes; that the accused carried two firearms on that occasion, namely, an

<p class="NUM">3. The futility of this appeal is thus obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The well-written opinion of the then Judge
Vasquez cannot be assailed for having been erroneous in any respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the refusal of appellant to present
testimony on his behalf, the case had to be decided on the evidence supplied by
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The outcome was
therefore predictable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony
thus offered sufficed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stage of moral certainty was
reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional presumption
of innocence had been overcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears
repeating that this Court, in the language of People v. <span class="SpellE">Mahinay</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
