				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Solicitor General appealed from the decision of the Judge of
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is established that on December 29, 1961, petitioner Wong <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Mei</span>, then seventeen years old
and a citizen of Nation­alist China, was admitted into the country as a
temporary visi­tor authorized to stay until March 15, 1962 and was issued ACR
B-6239 on the basis of her representation that her Chinese father, Wong Sum
alias Jose King, is a permanent resident of this country with whom she lived in
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte until she married her present husband
and co-petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabo</span>,
<span style="">on February 4, 1962 at St. Jude
Catholic Church, S</span>an <span style="">Miguel,
Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">She claims that her husband, co-petitioner <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rabo</span>, bearing Chinese name Ta <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>
Ta, is a natural born Filipino citizen, although he was born in <span class="SpellE">Chingkang</span>, Amoy, China, of a Chinese mother named Tee Lin
now known as Emma <span class="SpellE">Rabo</span>, because his father Benito <span class="SpellE">Rabo</span> is allegedly a Filipino citizen, allegedly a native of
Sta. Catalina, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>;
and that he was brought to the Philippines when he was about one year old and
baptized in the Catholic Church of <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contending that she is now a Filipino citizen by virtue of her
marriage to a Filipino citizen, petitioner Wong <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Mei</span> filed, on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1962</st1:date>, with the Bureau of Immigration a petition praying that
her alien registration be cancelled on the ground that she possesses no
disqualification to become a Filipino citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1962</st1:date>,
the Commissioner of Immi­gration, without hearing, denied her petition, because
her marriage to a Filipino citizen does not automatically confer upon her
Filipino citizenship, invoking the case of Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>
Ay.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1962</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction against the acting Commissioner of Immigration before
the Court of First Instance of Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 49865 (see
Annex B of Annex D, appellants brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their petition for <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction filed in the Manila Court of First In­stance,
petitioners recited the foregoing facts and argued that the statement of this
Court in the Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span> Ay case is merely obiter dictum
for the simple reason that the issue of citizenship was not raised therein;
that the clause "who might herself be lawfully naturalized", has been
consistently construed by the Supreme Court and the Secretary of Justice to
mean that the alien wife need not possess all the qualifications for natural­ization,
for it is enough that she does not labor under any of the disqualifications
enumerated in Sec. 4 of Com. Act 473 (citing Opinions of the Secretary of
Justice Nos. 176 of 1940 and 111 of 1953, as well as Ly <span class="SpellE">Giok</span>
Ha vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>, L-10760, May 17, 1957); and prayed
that the order of the Commissioner of Immigration denying her petition to
cancel her ACR be declared illegal and void <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ab</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></span></u>
and that the Commissioner of Immigration be re­strained from instituting
deportation proceedings against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision dated November 13, 1962, then Presiding Judge,
now Court of Appeals Justice, <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> upheld the decision of the Commissioner of
Immigration and dismissed the petition, holding among others that, while petitioners
have adduced evidence tending to show that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rabo</span> (Ta <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> Ta) is a
Filipino citizen, still his admitted marriage to co-petitioner Wong <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Mei</span> does not automatically
confer Filipino citizenship upon the latter, relying on Lee <span class="SpellE">Suan</span>
Ay vs. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Supreme Court ruled that the alien wife must possess all the
qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization; and that
the salutary pur­pose of such requirement is to "prevent making the said
mar­riage a subterfuge for conferring Filipino citizenship upon alien wives who
are not otherwise qualified to become Filipino citizens." (See Annex B-1
of appellant's brief.)</p>

<p class="BODY">From said decision of the Manila Court of First Instance,
petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein appealed to the Court of
Appeals, which however dismissed the said appeal on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date> for failure on the part of
petitioners-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to file their brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Annex A and p. 9 of appellant's brief.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>After appealing from the decision of the Manila Court of First
Instance of November 13, 1962 and before the dismissal of their appeal by the
Court of Appeals on July 31, 1963, peti­tioners spouses, on December 20, 1962,
filed before the Court </u><u><span style="">of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte</span></u><span style=""> the present petition subject of the present
appeal, praying that petitioner Wong <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Mei</span> be allowed to "follow or to acquire Filipino
citizenship by virtue of her marriage to a Filipino citizen".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 28, 1963, the Solicitor General filed an opposition on
the ground that under sec. 15 of Com. Act No. 473, an alien woman married to a
Filipino citizen "shall be deemed a citizen of the Philippines" only
if she might be lawfully naturalized; that the marriage alone to a Filipino
citizen does not automatically make her a Filipino citizen and that her
petition does not allege that she does not possess any of the eight
disqualifications under Sec. 4 of Com. Act No. 473.</p>

<p class="BODY">After said opposition was filed, petitioners spouses filed an
amended petition alleging among others that she is not among those disqualified
to be naturalized under Sec. 4 of Com. Act No. 473; without alleging that she
possesses all the qualifications under Sec. 2 of Com. Act No. 473.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, Judge <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> rendered, on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="2">February
 2, 1963</st1:date>, a decision declaring that petitioner Wong <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Mei</span> is a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by reason of her mar­riage to her co-petitioner <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rabo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1963</st1:date>,
the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte filed a
notice of appeal for and in behalf of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed an opposition dated <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1963</st1:date> to the approval of appeal on the
ground that no factual or legal question was raised during the trial and
therefore nothing could be raised on appeal and that the appeal is frivolous
and intended for delay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="4">April
 22, 1963</st1:date>, the court dismissed the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated April 26, 1963, the Provincial Fiscal prayed
for the reconsideration of the order dated April 22, 1963 dismissing the
appeal, on the ground that the notice of appeal was filed on time, that the
record on appeal was perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, and that the appeal raises a question of law which only the Supreme
Court can decide.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated August 26, 1963, the Solicitor General prayed
for the setting aside of the decision rendered on February 2, 1963 and/or for a
reconsideration of the order dated April 22, 1963 dismissing the appeal on the
ground that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction in this case for under
our laws, there can be no action or proceeding for the judicial declaration of
citizen­ship; that the instant case as well as the decision rendered therein is
barred by a prior judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila dealing
with the same subject matter and involving the same parties; and that the
appeal interposed by the Provincial Fiscal was perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1963</st1:date>,
petitioners filed an opposition to the aforesaid motion to set aside the
decision and/or supple­mentary motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">December
 4, 1963</st1:date>, the court granted the aforesaid motions to dismiss and for
reconsideration filed by the Solicitor General, set aside its decision dated <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1963</st1:date>, and dismissed the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated December 13, 1963, petitioners spouses moved
for the reconsideration of the order of December 4, 1963 on the ground that the
motion for reconsideration and motion to dismiss were filed by the Solicitor
General out of time and that the Solicitor General, having perfected his
appeal, all that the trial court can do is to approve the record on appeal and
cer­tify the case to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="12">December
 23, 1963</st1:date>, the trial court set aside its order dated <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1963</st1:date> dismissing the case
and approved the record on appeal filed by the Provincial Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been the consistent ruling of this Tribunal that there is
no proceeding authorized by law or by the Rules of Court for the judicial
declaration of citizenship of an individ­ual.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last restatement of this principle was pronounced in the case <span class="SpellE">Soria</span> vs. Commissioner of Immigration.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Such judicial declaration of citizenship cannot even be decreed pursuant to an
alternative prayer <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in a naturalization
proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, which is
the subject of the present appeal, is in the nature of a petition for declara­tory
judgment; because it prays that petitioner Wong <span class="SpellE">Sau</span> <span class="SpellE">Mei</span> "be allowed to follow or to acquire Philippine
Citizenship by virtue of her marriage to a Filipino citizen" (see original
petition and amended petition in the record of appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></span></u><span style="">
</span>is tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal by the
Court of Appeals on July 31, 1963 of Civil Case No. 49865 filed March 14, 1962
by the petitioners for <i>mandamus</i> and prohi­bition with preliminary
injunction against the acting Commissioner of Immigration before the Court of
First Instance of Manila, fore­closes the right of petitioners to file this
petition before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no dispute that both cases involve the same
issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the
allegations in Civil Case No. 49865 before the Manila Court of First Instance
are substantially the same as those in the original as well as the amended
petitions petitioners filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners in the said Civil Case before the Manila Court of First Instance
are the same petitioners in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The re­spondent or <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> in both cases is
the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
represented by the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The acting Commissioner of Immigration was merely a nominal party
respondent in Civil Case No. 49865 before the Manila Court of First Instance,
since the acting Immigration Commissioner represented and was an agent of the
