				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 22, 1965 <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Insurance
Company of North America, as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> of Motor
Service Company, Inc., sued the Republic of the Philippines to recover the sum
of P3,901.30 representing the insurance value of five packages of truck
replacement parts which the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Ser­vice
failed to deliver to said consignee, and damages caused to two cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaint, the Republic relied, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, upon the following affirmative defenses: </p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That it may not be sued in this instance
without its consent;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the operation by defendant Bureau of
Customs of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at the port of Manila
is pursuant to the duty enjoined by Section 1213 of the Ta­riff and Customs
Code, and was, during the time material hereto, merely the consequence of an
emergency measure principally designed to insure the prompt and continued
collection of customs duties and taxes on imported goods in view of the series
of strikes staged by the labor forces at the waterfront, which strikes this
Honorable Court may well take judicial notice of;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this Honorable Court has no jurisdiction
to hear the instant case which involves a money claim against the government,
for the reason that the requisites laid down by Act No. 3083, as amended, have
not been complied with by plaintiff;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial the lower court rendered the appealed judgment
sentencing the Republic to pay <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,901.30</span>, without costs, interest and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> on appeal
timely taken by the Republic who before filing its brief filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1968</st1:date> a motion to
dismiss the case relying upon our ruling in <st1:place><st1:city>Mobil</st1:city>
 <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region> etc.</st1:place> vs.
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service et al., G. R. No. L-23139
promulgated on <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1966</st1:date>
holding that the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is immune from suit as operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">By resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="1">January
 10, 1969</st1:date> <span class="GramE">We</span> required <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span>
to comment upon the aforesaid motion, and pursuant thereto said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> submitted on <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1969</st1:date> its COMMENTS AND COUNTER MOTION.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> admits that the main issue
raised in the case at bar is the non-suability of the State and that this court
has already ruled in the Mobil case that the Republic of the Philippines is
immune from suit as operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service
of the port of Manila but, for its part, moved that the appeal interposed by
the Re­public be dismissed upon the ground that its record on appeal fails to
state the date when it was served with notice of the decision of the lower
court, which data is necessary to show that its appeal was taken timely, this
omission being a sufficient ground for the dismis­sal of the appeal under
Section 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required, in turn, to answer <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
motion to dismiss the appeal, the Republic did so on <st1:date year="1969" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1969</st1:date> alleging therein the following as
reason why its appeal should not be dismissed.</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That while it is
true that aside from the order of the lower court approving the record on
appeal, our record on appeal does not contain any specific allegation that the
appeal was perfected on time, nevertheless, we respectfully submit that this
technical defect cannot be resorted to for the dismissal of defendant's appeal
for the reason that the case at bar is already moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the ruling laid down by this
Honorable Court in the Mobil Philip­pines case, supra, nullified the
proceedings had in the lower court, as the same had not acquired jurisdiction
over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal, therefore,
of the instant case would not impair the rights of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
as this Honorable Court has already set forth the proper procedure in the
prosecution of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> rights against the herein
appel­lant (Mobil Philippines Exploration Inc. vs. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service, supra)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon consideration of the foregoing, We are of the opinion that,
on the strength of our ruling in Mobil Philippines etc., upholding the <span class="SpellE">nonsuability</span> of the State, this case should be dismissed
because said ruling necessarily means that our courts have no jurisdiction to
render judgment against the Republic of the Philip­pines in any action of the
nature of the one at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as prayed for in appellant's motion mentioned
at the beginning hereof, the present case is dismissed, without costs.</p>
