<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">APPEAL OF AMADO V. HERNANDEZ 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After trial the Court of First 
Instance found, as against appellant Amado V. Hernandez, the following: (1)that 
he is a member of the Communist Party of the Philippines and as such had 
aliases, namely, Victor or Soliman; (2) that he was furnished copies of "Titis", 
a Communist publication, as well as other publications of the Party; (3) that he 
hold the position of President of the Congress of Labor Organizations; (4) that 
he had close connections with the Secretariat of the Communist Party and held 
continuous communications with its leaders and its members; (5) that he 
furnished a mimeographing machine used by the Communist Party, as well as 
clothes and supplies for the military operations of the Huks; (6) that he had 
contacted well-known Communists coming to the Philippines and had gone abroad to 
the WFTU conference at Brussels, Belgium as a delegate of the CLO, etc. Evidence 
was also received by the court that Hernandez made various speeches encouraging 
the people to join in the Huk movement in the provinces. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court also found that there 
was a close tie-up between the Communist Party and the Congress of Labor 
Organizations, of which Hernandez was the President, and that this Congress was 
organized by Hernandez in conjunction with other Huks, namely: Alfredo Saulo, 
Mariano Balgos, Guillermo Capadocia, etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We will now consider the nature 
and character of both the testimonial as well as the documentary evidence, 
independently of each other, to find out if the said evidence supports the 
findings of the court. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Amado V. Hernandez took the oath 
as member of the Communist Party in the month of October, 1947, at the offices 
of the Congress of Labor Organizations at 2070 Azcarraga in the presence of 
Guillermo Capadocia, Hamon Espiritu, Pedro Castro, Andres Balsa, etc. As a 
Communist he was given the pseudonyms of Victor and Soliman, and received copies 
of the Communist paper "Titis". He made various speeches on the following dates 
and occasions: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) On August 29, 1948 before the 
Democratic Peace Rally of the CLO at Plaza Miranda, in which he announced that 
the people will soon meet their dear comrade in the person of Comrade Luis 
Taruc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) On September 4, 1948 he 
conferred with Hindu Khomal Goufar at the Escolta, at which occasion Balgos told 
Goufar that the PKM, CLO and the Huks are in one effort; that the PKM are the 
peasants in the field and the Huks are the armed forces of the Communist Party; 
and the CLO falls under the TUD of theCommunist Party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) On October 2, 1948 he went 
abroad to attend the Second Annual Convention of the World Federation of Trade 
Unions and after arrival from abroad a dinner was given to him by the people of 
Gagalangin, at which Hernandez delivered a speech and he said that he preferred 
to go with the Huks because he felt safer with them than with the authorities of 
the Government. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(4) In April, 1949, he made a 
speech be-fore a group of tenants in Malabon attacking the frauds in the 1947 
elections, graft and corruption in the elections and that if improvement cannot 
be made by the ballots, they could be made by bullets; and enjoined the people 
to go to the hills and join Luis Taruc, the head of the dissidents in the 
Philippines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(5) On October 2, 1949 he 
delivered a speech on the occasion of the commemoration of the World Peace at 
the CLO head quarters at 330 P. Campa. He attacked the city mayor and incited 
the people to go to Balintawak and see Bonifacio there and thereafter join “our 
comrades under the leadership of Luis Taruc”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(6) On </span><st1:date month="10" day="16" year="1949"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 16, 
1949</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> he 
delivered a speech before a convention of the une mploy-.ed at 330 P. Campa. He 
asked the unemployed to approve a resolution urging the Govern-ment to give them 
jobs. In conclusion he said that if the government fails to give them jobs the 
only way out was to join the revolutionary forces fighting in the hills. He 
further said that Mao Tse Tung, leader of the People's Army in <span class="GramE">China.,</span> drove Chiang Kai Shek from his country, and that Luis 
Taruc was also being chased by Government forces run by puppets like Quirino, 
etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(7) On </span><st1:date month="1" day="13" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 13, 
1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
there was another meeting at 330 P. Campa. In his talk Hernandez expressed 
regret that two foremost leaders of the CLO, Balgos and Capadocia, had gone to 
the field to join the liberation army of the HMB, justifying their going out and 
becoming heroes by fighting in the fields against Government forces until the 
ultimate goal is achieved. <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above evidence was testified 
to by Florentino <span class="GramE">Diolata</span> who was the official 
photographer of the CLO since August, 1948. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the tie-up between the 
Communist Party and the CLO, Guillermo Calayag, a Communist and a Huk from 1942 
to 1950, explained: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) The ultimate goal of the 
Communist Party is to overthrow the present government by force of arms and 
violence; thru armed revolution and replace it with the so-called dictatorship 
of the proletariat; the Communist Party carries its program of armed over-throw 
of the present government by organizing the HMB and other forms of organizations 
such as the CLO, PKM, union organizations, and the professional and intellectual 
group; the CLO was organized by the Trade Union Division (TUD) of the Communist 
Party. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) A good majority of the 
members of the Executive Committee and the Central Committee of the CLO were 
also top ranking officials of the Communist Party; activities undertaken by the 
TUD - the vital undertaking of the TUD is to see that the directives coming from 
the organizational bureau of the Communist Party can be discussed within the 
CLO, especially the Executive Committee. And it is a fact that since a good 
majority of the members of the Executive Committee are party members, there is 
no time, there is no single time that these directives and decisions of the 
organizational department, thru the TUD, are being objected to by the Executive 
Committee of the CLO. These directives refer to how the CLO will conduct its 
functions. The executive committee is under the chairmanship of accused Amado V. 
Hernandez. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) The CLO played its role in 
the over-all Communist program of armed overthrow of the present government and 
its replacement by the dictatorship of the proletariat by means of propaganda - 
by propagating the principles of Communism, by giving monetary aid, clothing, 
medicine and other forms of material help to the HMB. This role is manifested in 
the very constitution of the CLO itself which expounded the theory of classless 
society and the eradication of social classes (par. 5, Sec. 1, Art. 2, page 18 
of the CLO Constitution contained in the Fourth Annual Convention Souvenir 
Program of the CLO, Exh. <span class="GramE">"V-1579").</span> Thru propaganda, 
the CLO promoted the alms of Communist Party and disseminated Communist ideas 
by: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(a) The conspicuous display of 
the portrait or pictures of Crisanto Evangelista (Exh. <span class="GramE">V-1662), founder of Communism in the

session hall of the CLO headquarters at 2070 Azcarraga and then at 330 P. 
Campa.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(b) The distribution of foreign 
communist reading materials such as the World Federation of Trade Union 
Magazine, International Union of Students magazine, Voice magazine of the marine 
cooks of the CIO, World Committee of the Defenders of the Peace magazine, Free 
Bulgaria magazine, Soviet Russia Today magazine and World Federation of 
Democratic Youth magazine (Exhs.V-911, V-907, V-910, V-899, V-912, V-853. V/996 
and V-967); <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(c) The publication and 
distribution of some local subversive publications such as the "Titis", "Bisig", 
Kidlat", which are Communist Party organs; "The Philippine Labor Demands 
Justice" and "Hands Off Korea" authored by accused Amado V, Hernandez; 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(d) Principles of Communism were 
also propagated thru lectures, meetings, and by means of organization of 
committee in the educational department as well as researches in the Worker's 
Institute of the CLO. <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(4) The CLO also helped carry out 
the pro-gram of the Communist Party thru infiltration of party members and 
selected leaders of the HMD within the trade unions under the control of the 
CLO. The Communist Party thru the CLO assigned Communist Party leaders and 
organizers to different factories in order to organize unions. After the 
organization of the union, it will affiliate itself with the CLO thru the 
Communist leaders and the CLO, in turn, will register said union with the 
Department of Labor; and the orientation and indoctrination of the workers is 
continued in the line of class struggle. After this orientation and infiltration 
of the Communist Party members and selected leaders of the 1MB with the trade 
unions under the control of the CLO is already achieved and the group made 
strong enough to carryout its aims, they will begin the sporadic strikes and the 
liquidation of anti-labor elements and anti-Communist elements and will create a 
so called revolutionary crisis. That revolutionary crisis will be done for the 
party to give directives to the HMB, who are fight-ing in the country sides and 
made them come to the city gates. The entry of the HMB is being paved by the 
simultaneous and sporadic strikes, by ultimate general strikes thru the 
management of the CLO. <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court upon consideration of 
the evidence submitted, found (l) that the Communist Party was fully organized 
as a party and in order to carry out its aims and policies established a 
National Congress, a Central Committee (CC), Politburo (PE), Secretariat (SEC), 
Organization Bureau (OB), and National Courier or Communication Division (NCD), 
each body performing functions indicated in their respective names; ('2) that in 
a meeting held on August 1.1, 1950 the SEC discussed the creation of a Military 
Committee of the Party and a new G-HQ, under which on September 29, 1950 the SEC 
organized a special warfare division, with a technological division;(3) that on 
May 5, 1950 a body known as the National Intelligence division was created, to 
gather essential military intelligence and, in general, all information useful 
for the conduct of the armed struggle; (4) that a National Finance Committee was 
also organized as a part of the Politburo and answerable to it; (5) that the 
country was divided into 10 Recos, the 10th Reco comprising the Manila and 
suburbs command; (6) that since November1,1949 the CPP had declared the 
existence of a revolutionary situation and since then the Party had gone 
under-ground and the CPP Is leading the armed struggle for national liberation, 
and called on the people to organize guerrillas and coordinate with the HMB on 
the decisive struggle and final armed overthrow of the Imperialist government; 
(7) that in accordance with such plan the CPP prepared plans for expansion and 
development not only of the Party but also of the EMB, the expansion of the 
cadres from 3,600 in July 1950 to 56,000 in September 1951,the HMB from 10,800 
in July 1950 to 172,000 in September 1951, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">et. <span class="GramE">seq<span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></span></span></em> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Around the month of January, 1950 
it was decided by the CPP to intensify 1MB military operations for political 
purposes. The Politburo sanctioned the attacks made by the Huks on the 
anniversary of the HMB on </span><st1:date month="3" day="25" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 25, 
1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The 
HMB attacks that were reported to the PB were those made In May, 1945; June 
1946; April 10, 1947; May 9, 1947; August 19, 1947; August 25, 1950; August 
26,1950; October 15 and 17, 1950; May 6, 1946; August 6,19^6; April 10, 1947.; 
May 9, 1947; August 19, 1947; April 29, 1949; August 25, I950.; August 26, 1950; 
September 12, 1950; March 26, 1950; March 29, 1950. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The theory of the prosecution, as 
stated in the lower court's decision, is as follows: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The evidence does not show that 
the defendants in these cases now before this Court had taken a direct part in 
those raids and in the commission of the crimes that had been committed. It is 
not, however, the theory of the prosecution that they in fact had direct 
participation in the commission of the same but rather that the defendants in 
these cases have cooperated, conspired and confederated with the Communist Party 
in the prosecution and successful accomplishment of the aims and purposes of the 
said Party thru the organization called the CLO (Congress of Labor 
Organizations)." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court found that the CLO is 
independent and separate from the CPP, organized under the same pattern as the 
CPP, having its own National Congress, a Central Committee (which acts in the 
absence of and in representation of the National Congress), an Executive 
Committee(which acts when the National Congress and the Executive Committee are 
not in session), and seven permanent Committees, namely, of Organization, 
Unemployment and Public Relations, Different Strikes and Pickets, Finance, 
Auditing, Legislation and Political Action. Members of the Communist Party 
dominate the committees of the CLO. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The supposed tie-up between the 
CPP and the CLO, of which Hernandez was the President, is described by the court 
below in its finding, thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Just how the CLO coordinates its 
functions with the Communist Party organ under which it operates was explained 
by witness Guillermo S. Calayag, one-time ranking member of the Communist Party 
and the CLO, who typewrite the 'Patnubay sa Education' from a handwritten draft 
of Capadocia, which is one of the texts used in the Worker's Institute of the 
CLO. According to him, the CLO plays its role by means of propaganda, giving 
monetary aid, clothing, medicine and other material forms of help to the HMB, 
which constitutes the armed forces of the Communist Party. Propaganda is done by 
lectures, meetings, and the organization of committees of the educational 
department as well as researches at the CLO Worker's Institute. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Another way of helping the 
Communist Party of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> is by allowing the Communist 
Party leaders to act as organizers in the different factories in forming a 
union. These Party Members help workers in the factories to agitate for the 
eradication of social classes and ultimately effect the total emancipation of 
the working classes thru the establishment of the so-called dictatorship of the 
proletariat. It is the duty of these Communist Party members to indoctrinate 
uninitiated workers in the union to become proselytes of the* Communist Party 
ideology. After the right number is secured and a union <span class="GramE">Is</span> formed under a communist leader, this union is affiliated 
with the CLO and this in turn registers the same with the Department of Labor. 
The orientation and indoctrination of the masses is continued with the help f 
the CLO. The primary objective of the CLO is to create what is called a 
revolutionary crisis. It seeks to attain this objective by first making demands 
from the employers for concessions which become more and more unreasonable until 
the employers would find it difficult to grant the same. Then a strike is 
declared. But the strikes are only preparation for the ultimate attainment of 
the Communist goal of armed overthrow of the government. After the workers in 
the factories have already struck in general at the behest of the Communist 
Party thru the CLO, a critical point is reached when a signal is given for the 
armed forces of the Communist Party, the HUB, to Intervene and carry the 
revolution now being conducted outside to within the city." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the basis of the above 
findings, the court be-low found Hernandez guilty as principal of the crime 
charged against him and sentenced him to Buffer the penalty of <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">reclusion perpetua</span></em> with the accessories 
provided by law, and to pay the proportionate amount of the costs. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Our study of the testimonial and 
documentary evidence, especially those cited by the Court in its decision and 
toy the Solicitor General in his brief, discloses that defendant-appellant Amado 
V. Hernandez, as a Communist, was an active advocate of the principles of 
Communism, frequently exhorting his hearers to follow the footsteps of Taruc and 
join the uprising of the laboring classes against capitalism and more 
specifically against America and the Quirino administration, which he dubbed as 
a regime of puppets of American imperialism. But beyond the open advocacy of 
Communistic Theory there appears no evidence that he actually participated in 
the actual conspiracy to overthrow by force the constituted authority. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Hernandez is the founder and head 
of the CLO. As such, what was his relation to the rebellion? if, as testified to 
by Guillermo S. Calayag, the CLO plays merely the role of propagation by 
lectures, meetings and the organization of committees of education by 
Communists; if, as stated, the CLO merely allowed Communist Party leaders to act 
as organizers in the different factories, to indoctrinate the CLO members into 
the Communist Party and proselytize them to the Communist ideology; if, as also 
indicated by Calayag, the CLO purports to attain the ultimate overthrow of the 
Government first by making demands from employers for concessions until the 
employers find it difficult to grant the same, at which time a strike is 
declared; <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">if it is only after the various 
strikes have been carried out and a. crisis is thereby developed among the 
laboring class</span></em>, that the Communist forces would intervene and carry 
the revolution — it is apparent that the CLO was merely a stepping stone in the 
preparation of the laborers for the Communists' ultimate revolution. In other 
words, the CLO had no function but that of indoctrination and preparation of the 
members for the uprising that would come. It was only a preparatory organization 
prior to a revolution, not the revolution itself. The leader of the CLO, 
therefore, namely Hernandez, cannot be considered as a leader in actual 
rebellion or of the actual uprising subject of the accusation. Hernandez, as 
president of the CLO, therefore, by his presidency and leadership of the CLO, 
cannot be considered as having actually risen up in arms in rebellion against 
the Government of the Philippines, or taken part in the conspiracy to commit the 
rebellion as charged against him in the present case; he was merely a 
propagandist and indoctrinator of Communism, he was not a Communist conspiring 
to commit the actual rebellion by the mere fact of his presidency of the CLO. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court below declares that 
since November 1949 the Communist Party of the Philippines had declared the 
existence of the revolutionary situation and since then the Party had gone 
underground, with the CPP leading the struggle for national integration, and 
that in the month of January 1950, it was decided by the said Party to intensify 
the HMB military operations for political purposes. The court implicates the 
appellant Hernandez as a co-conspirator in this resolution or acts of the 
Communist Party by his mere membership thereto. We find this conclusion 
unwarranted. The seditious speeches of Hernandez took place before <span class="GramE">November.,</span> 1949 when the GPP went underground. The court 
below has not been able to point out, nor have We been able to find among all 
acts at bid-touted to Hernandez, any single fact or act of his from which it may 
be inferred that he took part in the deliberations declaring the existence of a 
revolutionary situation, or that he had gone underground. As a matter of fact 
the prosecution's evidence is to the effect that Hernandez refused to go 
underground preferring to engage in what they consider the legal battle for the 
cause. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We have also looked into the 
different documents which have been presented at the time of the trial and which 
were confiscated from the office of the Politburo of the Communist Party. The 
speeches of Hernandez were delivered before the declaration by the Communist 
Party of a state of revolutionary situation in 1949. Neither was it shown that 
Hernandez was a member of the Executive Committee, or of the SEC, or of the 
Politburo of the Communist Party; so NO presumption can arise that he had taken 
part in the accord or conspiracy declaring a revolution. In short, there has 
been no evidence, direct or indirect, to relate or connect the appellant 
Hernandez with the uprising or the resolution to continue or maintain said 
uprising, his participation in the deliberations leading to the uprising being 
inferred only from the fact that he was a Communist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The practice among the top 
Communists, as declared by the trial court, appears to have 'been for important 
members, if they intend actually to join the rebellion, to go underground, which 
meant leaving the city, disappearing from sight and/or secretly joining the 
forces in the field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The document Exhibit F-562, which 
is quoted in the decision, contains the directive of the SEC of </span><st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1950"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 1, 
1950</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, to 
Saulo and Hernandez, which reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"11. In view of the new 
developments in the city, send out Elias who prefers to work outside. Present 
problem of fighting legally to Com. Soliman. If Soliman is prepared for 
martyrdom, retain him to fight legally. If not, send him out with Elias. Same 
goes with Com. Mino and other relatively exposed mass leaders." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And the lower court itself found 
that whereas Saulo went underground and joined the underground forces outside 
the City, Hernandez remained in the City, engaged in the work of propaganda, 
making speeches and causing the publication of such matters as the Communist 
Party leaders directed him to publish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">That Hernandez refused to go 
underground is a fact which is further corroborated by the following reasons 
(excuses) given by him for not going underground, namely:(l) that his term of 
councilor of the City of Manila was to extend to December, 1951; and (2) that he 
was elected President of the CLO for a term which was to end the year 1951. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As a matter of fact the SEC gave 
instructions to Hernandez not lo be involved with Nacionalista Rebelns, and 
reported to the Politburo that Hernandez "has tendencies of careerism and 
tending to want to deal with leaders of the Nacionalista Party instead of 
following CPP organizational procedures." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court below further found 
that Hernandez had been furnishing supplies for the Huks in the field. But the 
very document dated </span><st1:date month="12" day="3" year="1949"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 3, 
1949</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
Exhibit D-420-422, cited in the decision (printed, p. 49), is to the effect that 
clothes and shoes that Hernandez was supposed to have sent have not been 
received. It is true that some clothes had been sent thru him to the field, but 
these clothes had come from a crew member of a ship of the American President 
Lines. He also, upon request, sent a portable typewriter to the SEC or 
Politburo. <span class="GramE">furthermore</span>, a certain Niagara Duplicating 
machine received by Hernandez from one Rolland Scott Billiard, a crow member of 
the SS President Cleveland, appears later to have been forwarded by him to the 
officers of the SEC or the Politburo. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lastly, it further appears that 
Taruc and other CPP leaders used to send notes to appellant Hernandez, who in 
turn issued press releases for which he found space in the local papers. His 
acts in this respect belong to the category of propaganda, to which he appears 
to have limited his actions as a Communist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The acts of the appellant as thus 
explained and analyzed fall under the category of acts of propaganda, but do not 
prove that he actually and in fact conspired with the leaders of the Communist 
Party in the uprising or in the actual rebellion, for which acts he is charged 
in the information. And his refusal to go underground because of his political 
commitments occasioned by his term of election as president of the CLO, and the 
impressions caused by his acts on the Communist leaders., to the effect that he 
was in direct communication or understanding with the Nacionalista Party to 
which he was affiliated, creates in Us the reasonable doubt that it was not his 
Communist leanings but his political ambitions, that motivated his speeches 
sympathizing with the Huks. For which reason <span class="GramE">We</span> hold 
that the evidence submitted fails to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he has 
conspired in the instigation of the rebellion for which he in held to ac-count 
In this criminal case. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The question that next comes up 
for resolution la<span class="GramE">:Does</span> his or anyone's membership in 
the Communist Party per se render Hernandez or any Communist guilty of 
conspiracy to commit rebellion under the provisions of Article 136 of the 
Revised Penal Code? The pertinent provision reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"ART. 136. CONSPIRACY AND 
PROPOSAL TO COMMIT REBELLION OR INSURRECTION. – The conspiracy and proposal to 
commit rebellion or insurrection shall be punished, respectively, by prision 
correccional in its maximum period and a fine "which shall not exceed P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> pesos, and by prision correccional in its medium period 
and afine not exceeding 2,000 pesos." <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The advocacy of Communism or 
Communistic theory and principle is not to be considered as a criminal act of 
conspiracy unless transformed or converted into an advocacy of action. In the 
very nature of things, mere advocacy of a theory or principle is insufficient 
unless the communist advocates action, immediate and positive the actual 
agreement to start an uprising or rebellion, or an agreement forged to use force 
and violence in an uprising of the working class to overthrow constituted 
authority and seize the reins of Government itself. Unless action is actually 
advocated or intended or contemplated, the Communist Is a mere theorist, merely 
holding belief in the supremacy of the proletariat; a Communist does not yet 
advocate the seizing of the reins of Government by it. As a theorist the 
Communist is not yet actually considered as engaging in the criminal field 
subject to punishment. Only when the Communist advocates action and actual 
uprising, war or otherwise, does he become guilty of conspiracy to commit 
rebellion. Borrowing the language of the Supreme Court of the

only be justified by reference to the relationship of that status or conduct to 
other concededly criminal activity (here advocacy of violent overthrow), that 
relationship must be sufficiently substantial to satisfy the concept of personal 
guilt in order to withstand attack under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth 
Amendment. Membership, without more, in an organization engaged in illegal

form of aid and encouragement to permit the imposition of criminal sanctions on 
that basis. It must indeed be recognized that a person who merely becomes a 
member of an illegal organization, by that 'act' alone need be doing nothing 
more than signifying his assent to its purposes and activities on one hand, and 
providing, on the other, only the sort or moral encouragement which comes from 
the knowledge that others believe in what the organization is doing. It may 
indeed be argued that such assent and encouragement do fall short of the 
concrete, practical impetus given to a criminal enterprise which is lent for 
instance by a commitment on the part of the conspirator to act in furtherance of 
that enterprise. A member, as distinguished from a conspirator, may indicate his

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The most important activity of 
appellant Hernandez appears to be the propagation of improvement of conditions 
of labor through his organization, the CLO. While the CLO, of which he is the 
founder and active president, has communistic tendencies, its activity refers to 
the strengthening of the unity and cooperation between labor elements and 
preparing them for struggle; they are not yet indoctrinated in the need of an 
actual war with or against Capitalism. The appellant was a politician and a 
labor leader and it <span class="GramE">Is</span> not unreasonable to suspect that 
his labor activities especially in connection which the CLO and other trade 
unions, were impelled and fostered by the desire to secure the labor vote to 
support his political ambitions. It <span class="GramE">Is</span> doubtful whether 
his desire to foster the labor union of which he was the head was impelled by an 
actual desire to advance the cause of Communism, not merely to advance his 
political aspirations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Insofar as the appellant's 
alleged activities as a Communist are concerned. We have not found, nor has any 
particular act on his part been pointed to Us, which would indicate that he had 
advocated action or the use of force in securing the ends of Communism, True it 
is, he had friends among the leaders of the Communist Party, and especially the 
heads of the rebellion, but this notwithstanding, evidence is wanting to show 
that he ever attended their meetings, or collaborated and conspired with said 
leaders in planning and encouraging the acts of rebellion, or advancing the 
cause thereof. Insofar as the furnishing of the mimeograph machine and clothes 
is concerned, it appears that he acted merely as an intermediary, who passed 
said machine and clothes on to others. It does not appear that he himself 
furnished funds or material help of his own to the members of the rebellion or 
to the forces of the rebellion in the field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But the very act or conduct of 
his in refusing to go underground, in spite of the apparent desire of the chief 
of the rebellion, is clear proof of his non-participation in the conspiracy to 
engage in or to foster the rebellion or the uprising. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We next consider the question as 
to whether the fact that Hernandez delivered speeches of propaganda in favor of 
Communism and in favor1 of rebellion can be considered as a criminal act of 
conspiracy to commit rebellion as defined in the law. In this respect, the mere 
fact of his giving and rendering speeches favoring Communism would not make him 
guilty of conspiracy, because there was no evidence that the hearers of his 
speeches of propaganda there and then agreed to rise up in arms for the purpose 
of obtaining the overthrow of the democratic government as envisaged by the 
principles of Communism. To this effect is the following comment of Viada:

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view of all the above <span class="GramE">circumstances ;</span>,re find that there is no concrete evidence 
proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant (Hernandez) actually 
participated in the rebellion or in any act of conspiracy to commit or foster 
the cause of the rebellion. We are constrained, in view of the these 
circumstances, to absolve, as We hereby absolve, the appellant Amado V.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">All the other defendants were 
found guilty as accomplices in the crime of rebellion as charged in the 
information and were each sentenced to suffer the penalty of 10years and 1 day 
of <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">prision mayor</span></em>, with the 
accessories provided by law, and to pay their proportionate share ofthe coats. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Legal 
Considerations</span></em><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> - Before proceeding to consider 
the appeals of the other defendants, it is believed useful if not necessary to 
lay down the circumstances or facts that may be determinative of their criminal 
responsibility or the existence or nature thereof. To begin with, as We have 
exhaustively discussed in relation to the appeal of Hernandez, We do not believe 
that mere membership in the Communist Party or in the CLO renders the member 
liable either of rebellion or of conspiracy to commit rebellion, because mere 
membership and nothing more merely implies advocacy of abstract theory or 
principle without any action being induced thereby; and that such advocacy 
becomes criminal only if it is coupled with action or advocacy of action, 
namely, actual rebellion or conspiracy to commit rebellion, or acts conducive 
thereto or evincing the same. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other hand, membership In 
the HMB (Hukbalahap) Implies participation in an actual uprising or rebellion to 
secure, as the Huks pretend, the liberation of the peasant and laboring class 
from thraldom. By membership in the HMB, one already advocates uprising and the 
use of force, and by such membership he agrees or conspires that force be used 
to secure the ends of the party. Such membership, therefore, even if there is 
nothing more, renders the member guilty of conspiracy to commit rebellion 
punishable by law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And when a Huk member, not 
content with his member-ship, does anything to promote the ends of the rebellion 
like soliciting contributions, or acting as courier, he thereby becomes guilty 
of conspiracy, unless he takes to the field and joins in the rebellion or 
uprising, in which latter case he commits rebellion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vergara, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">infra</span></em>, the defendants organized a 
secret society commonly known as the "Katipunan", the purpose of which was the 
overthrow the government by force. Each of the defendants on various times 
solicited funds from the people of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, Pampanga. The Court held that 
the defendants were guilty of conspiracy and proposal to commit rebellion or

Government of the United States in the Philippine Islands, and therefore we find 
that said defendants, and each of them, did, together with others, in the months 
of February and March, 1903, In the Province of Pampanga, Philippine Islands,

<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court found him to be a 
Communist with various aliases, a member of the Central Committee of the CLO, 
member of the Central Committee of the CPP and as such committed to the 
establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. To the same effect is the 
testimony of Guillermo Calayag. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There <span class="GramE">Is</span> 
no evidence to connect him with the rebel-lion or to the conspiracy to commit 
rebellion. He should therefore be absolved of the charges contained <span class="GramE">In</span> the in-formation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">AMADO RACANDAY 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court found him guilty 
as a Communist, a Secretary and Executive Committee member of the CLO, a 
communications center of the Communist Party, having been found in possession of 
letters from Federico Maclang to Salome Cruz, and solicitor of contributions for 
the Huks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Racanday admits being a member of 
the Executive Committee of the CLO, Editor of the Kidlat of the Government 
Workers Union, receiving copies of the Titis. Calayag testified that he was a 
member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party entrusted with the duty 
of receiving directives of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The letters found in his 
possession are dated February 14, 195O, before the Communist Party went 
underground. We have been unable to find the evidence upon which the court bases 
its conclusion that he received contributions for the Huks. With these 
circumstances in mind <span class="GramE">We</span> are not convinced beyond 
reasonable doubt that as a Communist he took part in the conspiracy among the 
officials of the Communist Party to take part and support the rebellion of the 
Huks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are, therefore, constrained to 
absolve him of the charges filed against him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court found him to be a 
Communist since 1945, an officer of an organized Communist branch in

Committee and treasurer of the CLO. He admitted his membership and his position 
as member of the executive committee and treasurer of the CLO, these facts being 
corroborated by the witness Guillermo Calayag. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">His membership in the Communist 
Party dates as far back as the year 1945. As a communist, Genaro de la Cruz 
received quotas and monetary contributions coming from the areas under his 
jurisdiction, and one time he made a receipt from a member from 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> at the CLO headquarters at 2070 
Azcarraga signing the receipt as"Gonzalo" which is one of his aliases. He also 
distributed copies of the "Titis" magazine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While his membership in the 
Communist Party plus his having received contributions for the party indicate 
that he is an active member, it was not shown that the contributions that he 
received from Communist Party members were received around the year 1950 when 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party had already agreed to conspire and 
go underground and support the Huk rebellion. Under these circumstances <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot find him guilty of conspiracy to commit rebellion 
because of the lack of evidence to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">JULIAN LUMANOG 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court found him to be an 
organizer of HKB among the mill workers, solicited contributions for the HMB and 
Central Committee member of the CLO as per testimony of Guillermo Calayag. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">He admitted that he joined the 
Communist Party because he was made to believe that the Party is for the welfare 
of the laborers. He also admitted being a member of the Central Committee of the 
CLO. Calayag testified that Lumanog organized the HMB units of the Communist 
Party in the Lumber Unions and attended a Communist meeting held by Maclang. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Domingo Clarin testified that he 
(Julian Lumanog<span class="GramE">)used</span> to give the money collected by him 
to one Nicasio Pamintuan, one of the members of the HMB Special Unit (Trigger 
Squad) in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for the use of the said unit. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering that the HMB was 
engaged in a rebellion to overthrow the government, it is evident that by giving 
his contributions he actually participated in the conspiracy to overthrow the 
government and should, therefore, be held liable for such conspiracy, and should 
be sentenced accordingly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">FERMIN RODILLAS 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court found that Fermin 
Rodillas was a member of the CCP and the CLO; that his activities consisted in 
soliciting contributions, in cash and in kind, from city residents for the use 
of the HMB, turning over said collections to the Party; that he has also given 
asylum to a wanted Hukbalahap at his house at Juan Luna St. Gagalangin, which 
house was used as Military post. The above findings of the court are fully 
supported by the testimony of Domingo Clarin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering that while he has not 
actually taken part in the rebellion, he has shown sympathy with the cause by 
soliciting contributions for it and had given shelter to the Huks. We feel that 
the court was fully justified in finding him guilty, but We hold that he should 
be declared liable merely as a co-conspirator in the crime of conspiracy to 
commit rebellion, and should be sentenced accordingly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">BAYANI ESPIRITU 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This appellant was found by the 
court to be a Communist, he having admitted membership in the Communist Party 
since 1945; that his duties as a Communist was to help in the office of the 
national Finance Committee, assorting papers and written documents; that 
sometimes he accompanied the purchaser of medicines, shoes, papers, foodstuffs 
and clothing to be given to the Huks; that he is a member of the Communication 
Division of the CPP in Manila, in charge of distribution of letters or 
communications; that he admits having written to Salome Cruz, courier of the 
Communist Party, when he asked for his necessities, such as money and shoes, 
etc. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The facts found by the court are 
sufficiently supported "by the communications and evidence submitted by the 
prosecution. The exhibits show that he was in constant communication with the 
Communists, serving them as courier. His oath as a member of the Communist Party 
was submitted in court and in it he admits obedience to all orders of the Party 
and to propagate the stability of the <span class="GramE">PKP .</span> 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering that the PKP was 
engaged in an actual uprising against the constituted Government and that Bayani 
Espiritu was in constant communication with the Communist Party and served it as 
courier, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that the court was fully justified 
In finding him guilty. However, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe that not 
having actually taken up arms in the uprising he may only be declared guilty of 
conspiracy to commit rebellion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">TEOPISTA VALERIO 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The court below found that this 
appellant joined the Communists in 1938 in San Luis, Pampanga, under Casto 
Alejandrino, who later became her common-law husband; that her aliases are 
"Estrella" and "Star"; that she was found in possession of various documents 
written to top Communists like Aiejandrino, Lava and Romy, as well as a letter 
from Taruc congratulating her for the delivery of a son. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jose Taguiang testified that she 
was a member of the Provincial Committee of the CPP In Nueva Ecija, later 
Chairman of the Finance Department, and then promoted to Finance Officer of the 
Central Luzon Committee, Alicia Villegas, a Huk courier, testified that she 
delivered letters from the mountains to Teopista Valerio, who was in turn also a 
courier. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Without considering the close 
relationship that she had with top Communist Casto Alejandrino, We are satisfied 
that she herself was aside from being a Huk courier, also a Huk, a member of the 
HMD from 1942 to 1951. As she was a Communist and at the same time a member of 
the HMB, and considering that the HMB was engaged in an uprising to uproot the 
legitimate government, there cannot be any question that she was in conspiracy 
with the other members of her Party against the constituted government. We hold, 
therefore, that the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that she is guilty 
of conspiracy to commit rebellion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case at bar the 
prosecution is for actual rebellion which consists in rising publicly and taking 
arms against the Government for the purpose of removing from the allegiance to 
said Government or its laws, the territory of the Philippines, or any part 
thereof, etc., a crime defined in Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code; whereas 
Evangelista was charged and convicted for inciting to rebellion under Art. <span class="GramE">138, Revised Penal Code (formerly Sec. 2, Act No. 292).</span> As 
the specific charge against appellants is that of rising up in arms in actual 
rebellion against the Government, they cannot be held guilty of inciting the 
people to arms under Article 138, which is a different offense. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other hand, Rep. Act 1700, 
known as the Anti-Subversion Act, which penalizes membership in any organization 
or association committed to subvert the Government, cannot be applied to the 
appellants because said t was approved on June 20, 1957 and was not in force at 
the time of the commission of the acts charged against appellants (committed 
1945-1950); the Anti-Subversion Act punishes participation or membership in an 
organization committed to overthrow the duly constituted Government, a crime 
distinct from that of actual rebellion with which appellants are 
charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
