				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 30, 1955—pending hearing of Civil Case No. 24790 of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, entitled "Morris McConn vs. Paul Haragan", which was 
scheduled to take place on September 16, 1955—the Bureau of Immigration advised 
said court that defendant PaulHaragan had applied for an immigration clearance 
and a re-entry permit to enable him to leave the Philippines for 15 days only 
and requested information whether the court had any objection thereto. By an 
order dated July 11, 1955, the court required Haragan to file a bend of P4,000 
"to answer for his return to the Philippines and the prosecution of this case 
against him, with the understanding that upon his failure to return, said bond 
will answer <i>pro tanto</i> for any judgment that may be rendered against him". 
Thereupon, or on July 12, 1955, Haragan submitted a bond, subscribed by him and 
the Associated Insurance &amp; Surety Co., as principal and surety, 
respectively, reading:
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREAS, the above-bounden PRINCIPAL, is intending to leave the Philippines 
on a business trip to Hongkong and Tokyo, Japan, for a period of thirty (30) 
days from date of his departure, in connection with his business;</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, the above-bounden PRINCIPAL, has a pending case before the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, Branch III, entitled: "Allen McConn, Plaintiff vs. 
Paul Haragan, Defendant", Civil Case No. 24790, which is scheduled for hearing 
on September 16, 1955;</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, before the above-bounden PRINCIPAL could leave the Philippines for 
Hongkong and Tokyo, Japan, the above-mentioned Court has required him to post a 
Surety Bond, in the amount of PESOS FOUR THOUSAND ONLY (P4,000.00) Philippine 
Currency, to guarantee that he will return to the Philippines on or before 
September 16, 1955;</p>
<p>"NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the above premises, the 
principal and the Surety, hereby bind themselves, jointly and severally, in 
favor of the Republic of the Philippines, or its authorized representatives! in 
the sum of PESOS FOUR THOUSAND ONLY (P4,000.00) Philippine Currency, that the 
herein principal will return to the Philippines on or before September 16, 1955 
and that should he fail to do so, said bond will answer pro tanto for any 
judgment that may be rendered against him".</p></blockquote>
<p>Soon thereafter, or on July 19, 1955, tihe court issued an order stating that 
"in view of said bond, it would have no objection" to Haragan's "departure from 
the Philippines for a short stay abroad" and that "formal leave" was thereby 
given him. On the date set for the hearing of the case, Haragan's counsel moved 
for continuance, whereupon, the hearing was postponed to November 14, 1955. On 
the date last mentioned, the same counsel informed the court that Haragan had 
been unable to return to the Philippines because the Philippine Consulate in 
Hongkong had advised Haragan of a communication from our Department of Foreign 
Affairs banning him from returning to the Philippines. The court then postponed 
the hearing to January 6, 1956. Subsequently, Herbert T. Fallis was impleaded as 
defendant and, later on, one Inocencio Ortiz Luis, Jr. was allowed to intervene. 
In due course, thereafter, or on February 19, 1959, the court rendered judgment, 
which, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, sentenced Haragan to pay to plaintiff the sum of P5,500, with 
6% interest thereon from December 8, 1954, until full payment, plus P1,000 as 
attorney's fees and costs. After this judgment had become final and executory, 
plaintiff moved for the execution of the aforementioned bond to satisfy said 
judgment against Haragan. The surety company objected thereto upon several 
grounds and, after due hearing, the lower court issued an order dated October 
13, 1959, releasing said company from liability under the bond aforementioned 
and denying plaintiff's motion. A reconsideration of this order having been 
denied, the case is now before us on record on appeal filed by the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>The issue is whether the Surety Company is liable to plaintiff under the bond 
quoted above, in view of the failure of Haragan to return to the Philippines. 
The lower court decided the issue in the negative upon the following ground:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * A careful reading of the surety bond, Exhibit F, indicate that the 
surety's principal commitment is 'to guarantee that he (Haragan) will return to 
the Philippines on or before September 16, 1955' (See the third 'Whereas'). In 
the last paragraph of said surety bond, Exhibit F, it appears that said bond was 
executed in favor of the Republic of the Philippines or its duly authorized 
representatives to guarantee 'that the herein principal (Haragan) will return to 
the Philippines on or before September 16, 1955 and that<i> should he fail to do 
so</i>, said bond will answer <i>pro tanto for any judgment</i> that may be 
rendered against him.' As the terms of the bond so state, it appears clearly 
Chat, the bond will only answer for the judgment which may be rendered against 
defendant, should he (defendant Haragan) fail to return to the Philippines. In 
other words, if defendant Haragan should return to the Philippines on or before 
September 16, 1955, said bond will not answer for the judgment. It is now the 
contention of the Associated Insurance that since it was the Republic of 
Philippines (obligee under the bond) who rendered the return of defendant 
Haragan to the Philippines impossible, said surety company is thereby released 
from its obligation, and cites in support thereof Articles 1266 and 2076 of the 
New Civil Code. Upon a consideration of this contention, the Court finds it 
tenable and well grounded, for as the surety company has so well stated 'where 
the principal obligation (of returning to the Philippines) has been extinguished 
by the action of the obligee, Philippine Government, in preventing such return, 
the accessory obligation of the surety is likewise extinguished and the bond 
released of its liability.' Paraphrasing the last paragraph of the bond in a 
negative way, it will read thus: 'should he (not) fail to do so, said bond will 
(not) answer <i>pro tanto</i> for any judgment that may be rendered against 
him."</p></blockquote>
<p>We are fully in agreement with the foregoing view, which is in accord with 
the principle that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The debtor in obligation to do shall also be released when the prestation 
becomes legally or physically impossible without the fault of the obligor." 
(Article 1266, Civil Code of the Philippines.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, in Tabora vs. Lazatin, G. R. No. L-5245, May 29, 1953, we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This Court finds that despite his efforts to secure the necessary building 
permit for the reconstruction, he failed because of the disapproval or 
unfavorable attitude of the Urban Planning Commission toward reconstruction 
unless they conformed to the plan of widening the city streets. Finding that 
defendant had done all he could to secure the permit and to comply with his 
obligations, but because of the refusal of the government authorities to issue 
and permit, he failed to fulfill his undertaking, he should be absolved and 
released from said obligation."</p></blockquote>
<p>To same effect, substantially, is the decision of this Court in House vs. De la 
Costa (40 Off. Gaz., [3 S] 47).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with the costs of this 
instance against plaintiff-appellant. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
