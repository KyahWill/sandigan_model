<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1967</st1:date>,

It was asserted that the Court had acquired no jurisdiction over the person of

the Motion to Dismiss was heard and argued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, or on January 12, 1968, respondent Judge issued an Order
denying the afore-mentioned Motion to Dismiss for the reasons: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(1) that the address of the defendant James A.

service of summons and copy of the complaint was made at the said place and
received by one Vicente <span class="SpellE">Basallote</span>, Office Clerk; and
(3) that, as far as the service of summons and complaint was concerned, the
allegation in the complaint must prevail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the same Order, the defendants in said Civil Case No. 10392 were
given ten (10) days from receipt of said Order within which to file their

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for prohibition with preliminary
injunction praying that respondent Judge be prohibited from enforcing the Order
requiring petitioner to answer the complaint and to enter trial in Civil Case
No. 10392 of said Court, and from further proceeding in said action, which is
clearly beyond its jurisdiction; and that, pending the resolution of this
petition, a preliminary writ of injunction be issued against the respondent
Judge upon the filing of a bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1968</st1:date>,
this Court issued, as prayed for, the writ of preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue for determination in this case is whether or not
jurisdiction was lawfully acquired by the court <i>a quo</i> over person of
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Service of summons upon the defendant is the means by which the
court may acquire jurisdiction over his person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of a valid waiver, trial and judgment without such
service are null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This process is solely for the benefit of the defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Its purpose is not only to give the court jurisdiction of the person of the
defendant, but also to afford the latter an opportunity to be heard on the
claim made against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The summons must be served to the defendant in person.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It is only when the defendant cannot be served personally within a reasonable
time that a substituted service may be made.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Impossibility of prompt service should be shown by stating the efforts made to
find the defendant personally and the fact that such efforts failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement should be made in the proof of
service.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
This is necessary because substituted service is in derogation of the usual
method of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that
this method of service is "in derogation of the common law; it is a method
extraordinary in character, and hence may be used only as prescribed and in the
circumstances authorized by statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, under the controlling decisions, the statutory requirements of
substituted service must be followed strictly, faithfully and fully, and any
substituted service other than that authorized by the statute is considered
ineffective.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the constitutional requirement of due process requires
that the service be such as may be reasonably expected to give the desired
notice to the party of the claim against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Rules, substituted service may be effected (a) by
leaving copies of the summons at the defendant’s <i>dwelling house</i> or <i>residence</i><span style=""> </span>with some <i>person</i> of suitable
age and discretion then <i>residing</i> therein, or (b) by leaving the copies
at defendant's <i>office </i>or<i> regular place of business </i>with<i> </i>some<i>
competent person in charge thereof</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The terms "dwelling house" or "residence" are generally
held to refer to the time of service, hence it is not sufficient "to leave
the copy at defendant's former dwelling house, residence, or place of abode, as
the case may be, after his removal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
They refer to the place where the person named in the summons is living at the
time when the service is made, even though he may be temporarily out of the
country at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the
terms "office" or "regular place of business" refer to the
office or place of business of defendant at the time of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the rule designates the persons to
whom copies of the process may be left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule presupposes that such a relation of confidence exists between
the person with whom the copy is left and the defendant and, therefore, assumes
that such person will deliver the process to defendant or in some way give him
notice thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the dwelling house or residence of the
defendant, herein petitioner James A. <span class="SpellE">Keister</span>, is at
11 <span class="SpellE">Narra</span> Road, Forbes Park, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, and that his office or regular place of
business, prior to his temporary departure to the United States on March 27,
1967, is at the <span class="SpellE">Batjak</span> Corporation office in <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> Building, Ayala Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
however, conceded that in neither of these places was service of summons
effected in the manner prescribed by the procedural law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that "defendant James A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Keister</span>, without
notice to plaintiff and/or any of its officers and employees, <i>secretly</i>
and <i>surreptitiously</i> left the Philippines for the United States and up to
the present time he has not returned" does not warrant much less justify
the service of summons upon petitioner at a place which is neither his
residence nor regular place of business.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Montalban</i></span><i> v. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court explained that summons in a suit <i>in</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>personam</i></span>
against a resident of the Philippines temporarily absent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
may be validly effected by substituted service under Section 8, Rule 14 of the
Revised Rules of Court, and that Section 18 of Rule 14 is not the sole provision
that governs summons upon a defendant temporarily absent from the Philippines
in personal actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">As above indicated, the service of summons, in the case at bar, was
fatally defective and, therefore, insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the
court <i>a</i> <i>quo</i> over the person of petitioner James A. <span class="SpellE">Keister</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
