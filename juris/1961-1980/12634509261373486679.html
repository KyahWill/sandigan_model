				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an original action
for certiorari, prohibition and injunction, with preliminary injunction,
against an order of the Court of First Instance of </span><span style="">Manila, </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, upon the petitioner filing an injunction bond in
the amount of P3,000.00, let a writ of preliminary preventive and/or mandatory
injunction issue, restraining the respondents, their agents or representatives,
from further searching the premises and pro­perties and from taking custody of
the various documents and papers of the petitioner corpo­ration, whether in its
main office or in any of its branches; and ordering the respondent Central Bank
and/or its co-respondents to re­turn to the petitioner within five (5) days
from service on respondents of the writ of preventive and/or mandatory
injunction, all the books, documents, and papers so far seized from the <span style="">petitioner pursuant</span> <span style="">to </span>the aforesaid search warrant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the petition herein and of the re­quisite
bond, we issued, on August 14, 1962, a writ of preliminary injunction
restraining and prohibiting respondents herein from enforcing the order above
quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main respondent in this case, the First Mutual Savings and
Loan Organization, Inc. -- hereinafter referred to as the Organization --- is a
registered non-stock corpora­tion, the main purpose of which, according to its
Articles of Incorporation, dated February 14, 1961, is "to encourage x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and implement savings and
thrift among its members, and to extend financial assistance in the form of
loans," to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Organization
has three (3) classes of "members"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
namely: (a) <i><span style="">founder</span></i><span style=""> <i>members </i>-- </span>who originally join­ed
the or<span style="">g</span>ani<span style="">z</span><span style="">ation</span> <span style="">and have signed the </span>pre-incorporation
papers -- with <u>the exclusive right</u><span style="">
</span>to vote and be voted for; (b) <i><span style="">participating</span></i><span style=""> <i>members</i> -- with "<u>no</u> right
to vote or be voted </span>for" -- to which category <u>all other</u>
members belong; except (c) <i>honorary</i> <i>members</i>, so made by the board
of trustees, -- "at the exclusive discretion" thereof -- due to
"assistance, honor, prestige or help extended in the propagation" of
the objectives of the Organization – without any pecuniary ex<span style="">pe</span>nses on the part <span style="">of </span>said honorary members.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 14, </span>1962,
the legal department of the Central Bank of the Philippines -- hereinafter
referred to as the Bank -- rendered an opinion to the effect that the Organiza­<span style="">tion and </span>others of similar nature are
banking institutions, falling within <span style="">t</span>he
purview of the Central Bank Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, on April 1 and 3, 1962, the Bank caused to be published in the
newspapers the following:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>A</u> <u>N</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>N</u></span> <u>O</u> <u>U</u>
<u>N</u> <u>C</u> <u>E</u> <u>M</u> <u>E</u> <u>N</u> <u>T</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"To correct any wrong impression which recent newspaper
reports on 'savings and loan associations' may have created in the minds of the
public and other interested parties, as well <span style="">as to answer numerous inquires from the </span>public, the Central Bank
of the Philippines wishes to announce <span style="">that
all 'savings and loan associations' now in operation and other </span>organizations
using different corporate names, <span style="">but
engaged in operations similar in </span>nature to said 'associations' HAVE NEVER
BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE MONETARY BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES TO
ACCEPT DEPOSIT OF FUNDS FROM THE PUBLIC NOR TO ENGAGE IN THE BANKING BUSINESS
NOR TO PERFORM ANY BANKING ACTIVITY OR FUNCTION IN THE PHILIPPINES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Such institutions violate Section 2 of the General Banking
Act, Republic Act No. 337, should they engage in the 'lending of funds obtained
from the public through the receipts of deposits or the sale of bonds,
securities or obligations of any kind' without authority from the Monetary
Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their activities and operations
are not supervised by the Superintendent of Banks and persons dealing with such
institutions do so at their risk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CENTRAL BANK OF THE
PHILIPPINES",</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, on April 23, 1962, the Governor of the Bank directed
the coordination of the investigation and gather<span style="">ing of evidence </span>on the activities of the savings and loan
associations which are operating contrary to law." Soon thereafter, or on
May 18, 1962, a member of the intelligence <span style="">division </span>of the Bank filed with the Municipal Court of Mani­la a
verified application for a search warrant against the Organization, alleging
that "after close observation and personal investigation, the premises at
No. 2745 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ave­nue, Manila" -- in which the
offices of the Organization were housed -- "are being used
unlawfully," because said Or­ganization is illegally engaged in banking
activities, "by <span style="">receiving </span>deposits
of money for deposit, disbursement, safe­keeping or otherwise or transacts the
business of a savings and mortgage bank and/or building and loan association <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>without having first complied with the provisions
of <span style="">Republic Act No. </span>337"
and that the articles, papers, or effects enumerated in a list attached to said
application, as Annex A thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>are kept in said premises, and "being used or intended to be used
in the commission of a felony, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of said application, on May 18, 1962, Hon. Roman <span class="SpellE">Cancino</span>, as Judge of the said municipal court, issued the
warrant above referred to,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> commanding the search of the
aforesaid premises at No. 2745 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, Manila,
and the seizure of the foregoing articles, there being "good and
sufficient reasons to believe" - upon examination, under oath, of a
detective of the Manila Police Department and said intelligence officer of the
Bank --- that the Organization has un­der its control, in the address given,
the aforementioned articles, which are the subject of the offense adverted to
above or intended to be used as means for the commission of said offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, or on the same date, the Organization com­menced Civil
Case No. 50409 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, an original action for
"certiorari, prohibition, with writ of preliminary injunction and/or writ
of preliminary man­datory injunction," against said municipal court, the
Sheriff of Manila, the Manila Police Department, and the Bank, to an­nul the
aforementioned search warrant, upon the ground that, in issuing the same, the
municipal court had acted "with grave abuse of discretion, without
jurisdiction and/or in excess of jurisdiction" because: (a) "said
search warrant is a roving commission, general in its terms x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;" (b) "the use of
the word ‘and others’ in the search warrant x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">permits </span>the
unreasonable search and seizure of documents which have <span style="">no relation, whatsoever to any specific criminal act x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>;” </span>and (c) "no
court <span style="">in the Philippines has any
jurisdiction to </span>try a criminal case against a corporation x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.” </p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Organization,
likewise, prayed that, pending hearing of the case on the merits, a writ of
preliminary injunction be issued </span><u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
restraining <span style="">the aforementioned search
and seizure, or, in the alternative, if the acts complained of, have been
partially performed, that a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction be
forthwith issued <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, ordering the
preservation of the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u></span> <span style="">of the parties, as well as the immediate return </span><span style="">to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">he </span><span style="">Organization of the documents </span>and <span style="">papers so far seized under the search warrant </span>in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">After
due hearing, on the petition </span>for said injunction, <span style="">respondent, Hon. Jesus P. <span class="SpellE">Morfe</span>,
Judge, who presided over the branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila to
which said Case No. 50409 had been assigned, issued, on July 2, 1962, the order
complained of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Within the period stated
in said order, the Bank moved for a reconsideration thereof, </span>which was
denied on August 7, <span style="">1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the </span>Bank <span style="">commenced, in the Supreme Court, the present
action, against Judge <span class="SpellE">Morfe</span> and the Organization,
alleging that </span>respondent <span style="">Judge
had acted with grave abuse of discretion and in excess of his jurisdiction in
issuing the order in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the outset, it should
be noted that </span>the <span style="">action taken </span>by
the Bank, in causing <span style="">the aforementioned
search to be made and the articles above listed to be seized, was predicated
upon the theory </span>that the <span style="">Organization
was illegally engaged in b</span>ankin<span style="">g
- by receiving money for deposit, disbursement, safekeeping or otherwise, or </span>transacting
<span style="">the business of a savings </span>and
mortgage <span style="">bank and/or building and loan
association, -- without first complying with the provisions of R. A. No. 337,
and that the order complained of assumes that the Organization had violated
sections 2 and 6 of said Act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a><span style=""> Yet respondent Judge found the searches and seizures in question to be
unreason­able, through the following process of reasoning:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the depo­sition given in support of the
application for a search war­rant states that the deponent personally knows
that the premises of the Organization, at </span><st1:address><st1:street><span style="">No. 2745 <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
  Avenue</span></st1:street><span style="">, </span><st1:city><span style="">Manila</span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="">, were being used unlawfully for banking
purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge deduced, from
this premise, that the deponent "knows specific banking transactions of
the petitioner with speci­fic persons,” and, then concluded, that said deponent
"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> could have, if
he really knew of actual violation of the law, applied for a warrant to search
and seize only books" or </span>re<span style="">cords<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"covering the specific
purportedly illegal bank­ing transactions of the petitioner with <u>specific
persons</u> who are the supposed victims of said illegal banking transactions
according to his knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To authorize
and seize <u>all</u> the records listed in Annex A to said application for
search warrant, without reference to specific alleged victims of the purported
illegal banking transactions, would be to <span class="SpellE">harrass</span> the
petitioner, and its officers with a roving commission or fishing expedition for
evidence which could be discovered by normal intelligence operations or
inspection (not seizure) of books and records pursuant to Section 4 of Republic
Act No. 337 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The concern thus shown by respondent Judge for the civil liberty
involved is, certainly, in line with the function of courts, as ramparts of
justice and liberty, and deserves the greatest encouragement and warmest
commendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lives up to the highest
traditions of the Philippine Bench, which under­lies the people's faith in and
adherence to the Rule of Law and the democratic principles in this part of the
World.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, it cannot be gainsaid that the Con<span style="">stitutional injunction </span>against
unreasonable searches and seizures seeks to forestall, not purely abstract or
imaginary evils, but specific and concrete ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, unreasonable­ness <span style="">is, in </span>the very nature of things, a
condition dependent upon the circumstances surrounding each case, in much the
same way as the question whether or not "probable cause" exists is
one which must be decided in the light of the conditions obtaining in given
situations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Referring particularly to the one at bar, it is not clear from
the order complained of whether respondent Judge opined that the above mentioned
statement of the deponent - to the effect that the Organization was engaged in
the transactions mentioned in his deposition - deserved credence or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, however, a mere disagreement with
Judge <span class="SpellE">Can­cino</span>, who issued the warrant, on the
credibility of said state­ment, would not justify the conclusion that said
municipal <span style="">Judge </span>had committed a
grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction or excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
failure of the witness to mention particular individuals does not necessarily
prove that he had no per­sonal knowledge of <u>specific</u> illegal
transactions of the Or­ganizations, for the witness might be acquainted with
such specific transactions, even if the <u>names</u> of the individuals
concerned were unknown to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the aforementioned order would seem to assume that an
illegal banking transaction, of the kind contemplated in the contested action
of the officers of the Bank, must al­ways connote the existence of a
"victim." If this term is used to denote a party whose interests have
been <u>actually injured</u>, then the assumption is not necessarily
justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law requiring compliance
with certain requirements before any­body can engage in banking obviously seeks
to protect the public against actual, as well as <u>potential</u>, injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarl<span style="">y,
we are not aware of any rule limiting the use of search warrants to papers or
effects which cannot be secured otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The line of reasoning of
respondent Judge might, </span>per­haps, <span style="">be
justified if the acts imputed to the Organization consisted of <u>isolated</u>
transactions, distinct and detached from the type of business </span>in <span style="">which it is generally </span>engaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In
such case, it may be necessary to specify or identify the parties involved in
said isolated transactions, so that the search and seizure be limited to the
records pertinent t</span>here<span style="">to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such, however, is <u>not</u> the situation
confronting us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records suggest
clearly that the transactions objected to </span>by <span style="">the Bank constitute the <u>general pattern</u> of the business of the
Organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the <u>main</u>
purpose thereof, according to </span>its By-laws, <span style="">is "to extend financial assistance, </span>in <span style="">the form </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">loans, to its
members," with funds deposited by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, that such funds are referred to - in the Arti­cles of
Incorporation and the By-laws - as their "savings," and that the
depositors thereof are designated as "members," but, even a cursory
examination of said documents will readily show that <u>anybody</u> can be a
depositor and thus be a "participating member." In other words, the
Organization is, in effect, open to the "public" for deposit
accounts, and the funds so raised may be lent by the Organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the power to so dispose of said
funds is placed under the <u>exclusive</u> authority of the "founder
members," and "participating members" are <u>express­ly denied
the right to vote or be voted for</u>, their "privileges and
benefits," if any, being limited to those which the board of trustee may, <u>in
its discretion</u>, determine from time to time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, the "membership” of
the ''participating members" is purely nominal in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This situation <span style="">is </span>fraught, precisely, with the very dangers or evils which
Republic Act No. 337 seeks to forestall, by exacting compliance with the
requirements of said Act, before the transactions in question could be
undertaken.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="">interesting to
note, also, that the Organization does not seriously contest the main facts,
upon which the action </span>of the Bank is based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal issue raised by the <span style="">Organi</span>zation is predicated upon the
theory that the aforementioned transactions of the Organization do not amount
to "banking," as the term is used in Republic Act No. 337.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are satis­fied, however, in the light of
the circumstances obtaining <span style="">in </span>this
case, that the Municipal Judge did not commit a <span style="">grave </span>abuse of discretion in finding that <span style="">there was </span>probable cause that the
Organization had violated Sections 2 and 6 of the aforesaid law and in issuing
the warrant in question, and that, accordingly, and in line with Alvarez vs.
Court of First Instance (64 Phil. 33), the search and seizure complained of
have not been proven to be unreasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of respondent Judge dated July 2,
1962, and the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued in compliance
therewith are hereby annulled, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by
this Court on August 14, 1962, accordingly, made permanent, with costs against
