SALVADOR D. LACUNA, PETITIONER VS. BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS, PEDRO Q. MOLINA, AS COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINE AIR FORCE AND COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The facts of this case, as determined by the Court of Appeals and borne by 
the evidence, are as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"About September 11, 1953, Cirilo S. Damian was granted authority by the 
Philippine Air Force, Philippine Army, to repair buildings belonging to the PAF. 
For Damian's services, it was agreed that he would be paid in surplus 
properties. </p>
<p>"After having received therefor certain surplus properties, Damian, on 
September 23, 1905 (Letter, Exhibit 3-A, PAF) assigned his rights to the balance 
in surplus properties due him (deed, Exhibit I) in favor of plaintiff Salvador 
D. Lacuna who forthwith, as said assignee, notified the Philippine Air Force of 
the assignment in his favor on September 24, 1955 (Exhibit K). </p>
<p>"Subsequently, however, that is, on June 14, 1956, Cirilo S. Damian coursed a 
letter (Exhibit R-4) addressed to the Commanding General of the PAF in which he 
stated that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Because of the failure of Mr. Salvador D. Lacuna to comply with the 
obligations imposed, the deed of assignment in his favor is without 
consideration and said deed is heretofore revoked and without effect. </p>
<p>'Any delivery after this notification, is without authority and will be 
deemed as not receipted for by the undersigned and will not discharge your 
obligation due and owing to the undersigned." </p></blockquote>
<p>"In effect, the PAF (Philippine Air Force) notified Lacuna that it would no 
longer honor the previous assignment. Inasmuch, however, as there was still due 
in favor of Damian from the PAF the sum of P8,624.69 (Exhibit H) and because the 
assignee Salvador has not yet been paid what was due him, he (Lacuna) filed the 
instant complaint against the Philippine Air Force and included therein as 
defendant the Board of Liquidators which was then in charge of the surplus 
properties. Note that in plaintiff's complaint his assignor Cirilo S. Damian was 
not included as party-defendant." </p></blockquote>
<p>The action was for specific performance with a prayer for an order commanding 
the defendants "to recognize the Deed of Assignment executed by Cirilo S. Damian 
in favor of the plaintiff and to implement the provisions thereof." After trial, 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, where this suit was initiated, dismissed 
the complaint. On elevation of the Court of Appeals, the dismissal wag affirmed. 
Hence this petition for certiorari. </p>
<p>The Court notes from the records of this case that the assignor, Cirilo 
Dnmian, filed a motion for intervention in the trial court which motion, 
however, was denied by the trial judge. Even the Court of Appeals in its 
decision made special note of the fact Hint in the complaint filed by the 
assignee, the assignor was excluded as a party defendant. After carefully going 
over the points and issues raised in this appeal, it is our view that the 
intervention of the assignor should have been allowed. He is clearly an 
indispensable party to this suit and the failure to hear his side would not only 
be an injustice to him but would likewise prevent a fair and just review of this 
appeal. </p>
<p>Of course, We are aware that the assignor has not appealed from the order 
denying his motion for intervention. Be that as it may, We believe that he 
should be allowed to intervene in the interest of justice. </p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, let the records of this case lie remanded to 
the trial court with instruction to allow the assignor's intervention and 
thereafter to render judgment accordingly. So ordered. </p><i>Bautista Angelo, 
Concepcion, Paredes, Dizon</i> and <i>Bengzon, J.P.</i> concur. <br><br><br>
