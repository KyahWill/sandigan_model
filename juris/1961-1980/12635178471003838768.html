approval by the Provincial Governor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Insofar as pertinent to
the issue in this proceeding, the </span>facts of <span style="">the case, as stipulated by the parties, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a resolution dated 23 <span class="SpellE">July</span> 1963 (No. 64, series </span>of 1963), the <span style="">Municipal Council of San Jose, Antique
approved the exchange of its Lot No. </span>1611, <span style="">with an area of 1,122 square meters and assessed at P1,120.00, for the
lot owned by <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span> Sons Company</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>to be
used </span>as site <span style="">of an electric
plant projected by the municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
another resolution passed on the same day (No. 65), the municipal mayor was
authorized to sign the necessary contract, for and in behalf of the
municipality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="12">4 December 1963</st1:date>
the municipal mayor, representing the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>San Jose</st1:placename></st1:place>, Antique, and the
representative of <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span> Sons Company signed the
deed, by virtue of which the municipality conveyed to the latter its Lot No. 1611
by way of exchange for Lot No. 1303 belonging to the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This deed was duly presented to the Office of
the Register of Deeds for registration on <st1:date year="1963" day="10" month="12">10 December 1963</st1:date>, but not definitively recorded until <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">25 January 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 February 1964, however, the Provincial Board of Antique, by
its resolution No. 122, series of 1964, disapproved Resolution No. 64 of the
Municipal Council of San Jose relative to the exchange of lots, <span style="">on the ground that the <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span>
lot, being located in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>, is an unsuitable
site for the proposed electric plant, since the exhaust, noise and hazards
accompanying the operation of the plant machinery would be dangerous to public
safety and health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="18" month="2"><span style="">18
 February 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
San Jose Municipal Council passed another resolution urging reconsideration of
the action taken by the Provincial Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently because no action by the board seemed to be forthcoming, on
25 Jan­uary 1965 <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span> Sons Company instituted
declaratory relief proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Antique
(Special Civil Case No. 418) to secure nullification of Resolution No. 122 of
the Provincial Board of Antique, for a declaration of its ownership of Lot No.
1611, and to restrain therein respondent municipality from asserting the
latter's supposed right of ownership over the said lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1"><span style="">25 January 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the deed of exchange was finally registered
with the Register of Deeds as regards the transfer of Lot No. 1303 of <span class="SpellE">Pe­chueco</span> Sons Company to the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">San Jose</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, and, as a con­sequence, TOT No. N-5169 was
issued in the name of said municipal corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot No. 1611, however, remained registered in
the name of the municipality, the owner's title thereto not having been as yet
reconstituted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the case was pending in court, the Provincial Board passed
Resolution No. 57, dated 2 February 1965, conditionally approving the contract
of exchange between the municipality of San Jose and the <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span>
Sons Company, provided the <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span> lot should be
acceptable to the Rural Electrification Administration, the Secretary of
Finance and the Executive Secretary as site of the proposed electric plant.
Apparent­ly, the condition thus imposed was not met by the parties, for on 16
February 1965 the Provincial Board approved another resolution passed by the
municipal council of San Jose, this time requesting the Provin­cial Governor to
donate to the municipality a 10,000-square meter piece of land to be used as
site of the electric plant to be constructed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="10">12
 October 1965</st1:date>, the Provincial Governor formally informed the
municipal council of <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city> of
the disapproval of the deed of exchange entered into by the municipality with <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span> Sons Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="10">13 October 1965</st1:date>,
the said Governor entered appearance as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in
the declaratory relief proceeding, which intervention was allowed by the court
on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="11">24 November 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="8">30 August 1966</st1:date>,
on the basis of the stipulation of facts by the parties, the court rendered
Judgment in favor of the respondents, as stated at the beginning of this
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal interposed
by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pechueco</span> Sons Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> facts, the issue
clearly revolves <span style="">around the effect of </span>the
disapproval by the Provincial Board of <span style="">Antique
of </span>the contract of exchange of land between the municipality and herein
appellant authorized by Resolution No. 64, series of 1965, of the municipal
council of <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>this
connection, Section 2196 of the Revised Administrative Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 2196.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Execution of deeds</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- </span>When
the government of a municipality is party to a deed or an instrument which
conveys real property or any interest therein or which creates a lien upon the
same, such deed or instrument shall be executed on behalf of the municipal
government by the mayor, upon resolution of the council, with the approval of
the provincial governor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Taking the above-quoted provision in the
light of Ar<span style="">t</span>icle 1356 of the
Civil Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the question that must first be determined concerns the nature of that
requisite approval: is the approval of the contract by the governor a statutory
formal requirement for its validity?</p>

<p class="BODY">Espousing the negative view, appellant Company refers to our
ruling in the case of Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span> vs.
Lopez (99 Phil. 187) in support of its allegation that the gubernatorial
approval mentioned in Section 2196 of the Revised Administrative Code does not
constitute an essential element for the validity of the conveyance of realty by
the municipality; that the lack of such imprimatur <span style="">would not </span>nullify an otherwise valid and perfected contractual
agreement. In - deed, this Court, explaining the nature of this power in that
cited case, said:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . . . The approval by the provincial
governor of contracts entered into and executed by a municipal council, as required
in section 2196 of the Revised Administrative Code, is part of the system of
supervision that the provincial government exercises over the municipal
governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a prohibi­tion
against municipal councils entering into contracts regarding municipal
properties subject of municipal administration or control. It does not deny the
power, right or capacity of municipal councils to enter into such contracts;
such power or capacity is recog­nized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only the exercise thereof is subject to supervision by approval or
disapproval, <span class="SpellE">i</span>. e., contracts entered in pursuance of
the power would ordinarily be approved if entered into in good faith and for
the best interests of the municipality; they would be denied approval if found
illegal or unfavorable to public or municipal interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of the approval, therefore, does
not per se make the contracts null and void."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In other words, as regard the municipal
transactions specified in Section 2196 of the Revised Administrative Code, the
Provincial Gov­ernor has two courses of action to take -- either to approve or
disapprove the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since absence
of such approval does not necessarily render the contract entered into by the
municipality null and void, the transaction remains <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>
until such time when by subsequent unfavorable action of the governor, for
reasons of public interest,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the contract is thereby invalidated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Undisputably</span></span><span style="">, the resolution of the municipal council
authorizing the transaction involved herein was disapproved by the Provincial
Board on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="2"><span style="">11 February 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> on the ground of unsuitability of the
selected lot as site of the electric plant to be erected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In short, <span style="">the disapproval of the resolution by the Provincial Board was for
reasons of public interest, health and safety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is claimed for appellant company, however, that such <u>disapproval
is ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></u> and did not prevent its
acquisition of the ownership of the municipality's Lot No. 1611, for the
Provincial Board can declare a resolution of the municipal council invalid only
on one ground -- lack of authority of said body to pass the same.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the present case, it is added, there is
no question that the resolution authorizing the exchange of lots as within the
competence of the municipal council of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Jose</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> to enact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention of appellant cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the invoked cases reveals that
the limitation placed upon disapproval power of the provincial boards to review
and pass upon the legality of municipal proceedings Was conferred by <u>Section
2233</u> of the Revised Administrative Code in general terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last paragraph of said section provides
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"If the board should in any case find that any resolution,
ordinance, or order, as aforesaid, is beyond the powers conferred upon the
council or mayor making the same, it shall declare such resolution, ordinance,
or order invalid, entering its action upon the minutes and advising the proper
municipal authorities thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
effect of such action shall be to annul the resolution, ordinance, or order in
question, subject to action by the Secretary of the In - tenor (now Executive
Secretary) as hereinafter provided."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not only is the provision in question couched in general terms,
but were such power not limited to <u>ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></u>
municipal action, the result would be that the provincial board would be
running the affairs of the municipalities under its supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By contrast, <u>Section 2196</u> of the
devised Administrative Code (heretofore quoted) expressly speaks of the
execution of deeds of conveyance of real property and is unmistakably limited
to that class of transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
familiar rule of statutory construction that specific provisions control
general ones (<span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> Sawmill, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayview</span> Theater Co., 96 Phil. 139, and cases cited therein;
<span class="SpellE">Cassion</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Nacional</span> Filipino, 89 Phil. 560), and hence, Section 2196
of the Administrative Code must be deemed an exception to the general rule of
Section 2233.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, the
pronouncement made in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Manantan</u></span> and <u>Gabriel</u>
cases, construing the latter provision, cannot be invoked nor applied to action
taken by the provincial Governor under Section 2196 of the Administrative Code,
that requires approval by the Governor of conveyances of municipal real estate
without limiting or specifying the reasons for his refusal to concur therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the disapproval of the contract of exchange was
effected in this case by the Provincial Board and not by the Governor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But any objection on this ground would be
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the
Governor herself was part of the Provincial Board and actually participated in
the passage of the resolution of disapproval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said Board resolution, disapproving the exchange of lots and showing
that the Governor took part there­in, constitutes already the disapproval of
the contract by the latter, there being no provision requiring said official to
embody his unfavorable action in a particular instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were the action favorable, there would be
need for affixing the Governor's assent in the deed of conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, there is no gainsaying the fact
that the municipal council of San Jose and the private parties concerned,
including herein appellant, were duly, informed and furnished with copies of
the resolution of disapproval by the Provincial Board<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and, as of 11 February 1964, they were already fully apprised of the stand of
the provincial government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering that the
contract between the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">San
  Jose</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">
and appellant was finally registered only on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1"><span style="">25 January 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, or after its disapproval by the Provincial
Board, it is beyond doubt that such registration did not confer any right at
all on appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By then, the municipal
council was without authority to contract with appellant on the lots subject of
exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the fact that the
municipality accepted appellant's payment of real estate </span>tax on Lot No.
1611 for 1964 and 1965, or that it has expended some amount in reconstituting
the title of said Lot No. 1611, does not work to <span class="SpellE">estop</span>
the municipality from maintaining its claim of ownership over the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court aptly stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> cannot be
applied as against a municipal corporation to validate a contract which it has
no power to make, or which it is authorized to make only under prescribed
conditions, within prescribed limitations, or <span style="">in </span>a prescribed mode or manner, although the corporation has
accepted the benefits thereof and the other party has fully performed his part
of the agreement, or has expended large sums in preparation for
performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reason frequently
assigned for this rule is that to apply the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
against a municipality in such case would be to enable it to do indirectly what
it cannot do directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(San Diego
vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, L-9920, 29 February 1960,
cited in <span class="SpellE">Favis</span> vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sabañgan</span>, L-26522, 27 February 1969, 27 SCRA 92; see also
