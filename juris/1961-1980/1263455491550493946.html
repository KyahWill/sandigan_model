<p class="BODY">While crossing Taft Avenue extension, near its intersection with
Castro Street, Manila, passing by the pedestrian lane, on August 18, 1958,
about 8:30 a.m., and as he was about to reach the island the middle of the
road, David Epstein hereinafter referred to a plaintiff was hit by a <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>-bound bus of the MD Transit &amp; Taxi Co., Inc. -
hereinafter referred to as appellant - driven by <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>, in consequence of which plaintiff' s left
femur and right fibula were fractured, apart from sustaining lacerations in
scalp, occipital region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecuted for
serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence, the Court of First
Instance of Manila found <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> guilty thereof
beyond reasonable doubt and sentence, him to suffer the corresponding penalty
of imprisonment,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
but, re­frained from making any pronouncement on his civil liability, plaintiff
having reserved the right to file a separate civil action for dam­ages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although, from the decision of said court, <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals, he, later,
withdrew the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a con­sequence,
said decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1961" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="1">January
 23, 1959</st1:date>, plaintiff had commenced the present action for damages
against <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> and appellant herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> was
declared in default, whereas appellant filed its answer alleging that it had
exercised due diligence in the selection of its employees and in supervising
them in the performance of their duties, and that the accident was due to
plaintiff’s recklessness or negligence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance of Manila
rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding defendant, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>, primarily
liable to plaintiff, David Epstein, for the damages sustained by the latter,
and hereby orders the for­mer to pay the latter the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1) Actual damages in the amount of P3,161.10;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) Compensatory damages in the amount of P12,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) Moral damages in the amount of P5,000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4) Counsel fees in the amount of P1,000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finding defendant MD Transit and Taxi Co., Inc., subsidiary
liable to plaintiffs David Epstein, in the amounts above-indicated, in the event
that de­fendant, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>,
fails to pay the same or is insolvent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Costs against defendants. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, said decision was affirmed by the Court of Ap­peals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for review by
certiorari, filed by ap­pellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised by the latter refers the nature of the
present action, namely, whether the liability sought to be en­forced therein
arises from a crime, as contended by the plaintiff, or from a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, as urged by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The importance of this issue is due to the
fact that appellant's alleged diligence in the selection of its employees and
in exercising supervision over them would be a good defense should the action
be based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, but not if predicated
upon a liability springing from a crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court and the appellate court rejected appel­lant's pretense
and sustained that of the plaintiff, and, we think, correctly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, in his complaint, plaintiff premised his action against
herein appellant upon the allegation that the latter is "<span class="SpellE"><u>subsidiarily</u></span> liable for all damages caused by
negligence of its employee in the performance of his duties," and,
accordingly, prayed that <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> be ordered and,
"<u>upon his inability</u>," appellant herein, to pay the damages
claimed in said pleading. In other words, plaintiff maintained that <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> is <u>primarily</u> liable for said damages, and
that appellant's liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is purely, <u>secondary</u>,
which is typical of the civil liability arising from crimes, pursuant to
articles 102 and 103 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The effect of said allegation and subsequent prayer upon the nature of
the present action is illustrated by the case of De Leon, Brokerage v. Court of
Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> in
which the allegations the complaint were not clear on whether or not the
damages sued for resulted from a crime or from a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue was resolved in favor of the latter
alternative, in view of the <u>prayer</u> in said pleading to the effect that
the employer be held "<span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with his
employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, solidarity is one of
the main characteristics of obligations arising from quasi-delicts.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another circumstance militating in favor of plaintiff' s
contention is the fact that, in the criminal action, he had reserved right to
seek indemnity in a separate civil action. There can be doubt that the present
action was filed in pursuance of said reser­vation, which would have been
unnecessary had plaintiff not based his right of action upon <span class="SpellE">Sembrano's</span> criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further corroboration is supplied by the fact
that the first piece of evidence offered by plaintiff herein, at trial of this
case in the court of origin, was the decision of conviction rendered in the
criminal case against <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's pretense, the absence of allegations, in
plaintiff's complaint, about <span class="SpellE">Sembrano's</span> conviction in
the criminal case, and about his insolvency, does not impair the theory of the
plaintiff, for such allegations are not indispensable in an action for damages
sustained on account of a crime committed by the employee. Indeed, the law
authorizing the commencement of a civil action based upon a liability arising
from a crime, even <u>before </u>the institution of the criminal action,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a>
necessarily implies that the rendition of a judg­ment of conviction in the
latter need not be alleged in the civil complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is an allegation of insolvency of the employee essen­tial
to an action to enforce the subsidiary liability of the employer, particularly
when <u>both</u> are sued in the same action — as in the case at bar — to exact
the <u>primary</u> liability of the employee, and the <u>sub­sidiary</u>
liability of the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure,
the secondary nature of the latter's obligation necessarily connotes that his
properties may <u>not</u> be levied upon, in pursuance of a writ, of execution
of the judgment declaring the existence of both liabilities, <u>as long and so
long</u> as the employer can point out properties of the employee which may be
levied upon in satisfaction of said judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> Thus, the employee's solvency is
merely a matter of <u>defense</u> which may be availed of by the employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next urged that the lower courts erred in considering in
this case the judgment of conviction in the criminal case, in which appellant
was not a party, and in disregarding appellant' s evi­dence on the alleged
diligence exercised in selecting its employees and in supervising them in the
discharged of their duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though
relevant in an action based upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, said
diligence is, however, immaterial in the case at bar, the same being predicate
upon a liability arising from a crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it is already settled that the judgment of conviction in the
criminal case against employee, is, <u>not only admissible</u> in evidence in
the civil case against the employer, but, also, <u>conclusive upon his
subsidiary liability</u> arising from the employee's criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in Miranda v. <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>
Garage &amp; Taxicab, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> we held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that an employer, strictly speaking is not a party
to the criminal case instituted against his employee but <u>in substance and in
effect he is, considering the subsidiary liability imposed upon him by law</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is his concern, as well as of his
employee, to see to it that his interest be protected in the criminal case <u>by
taking virtual participation in the defense of his employee</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He cannot leave him to his own fate
because his failure is also his</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
if because of his indiffer­ence or inaction the employee is convicted and
damages are awarded against him, <u>he cannot later be heard to complain if
brought to court for the enforcement of his subsidiary liability that he was
not given his day in court</u>." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The language used in <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
v. Barredo<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a>
was:</p>

<blockquote>"The important question is <u>whether a judgment of conviction
sentencing the defendant to pay an indem­nity is conclusive in an action
against his employer for the enforcement of the latter's subsidiary liability
un­der Articles 102 and 103 of the Revised Penal Code</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision makes reference to two
earlier decisions of this Court, namely, City of Manila vs. Ma­nila Electric
Co., 52 Phil., 586, holding that such judg­ment of conviction is <u>not
admissible</u>, and <span class="SpellE">Arambulo</span> vs. Manila Electric Co.,
55 Phil., 75, in effect holding that it is <u>merely prima facie</u> evidence,
and to the prevailing view in the United States to the effect that the person <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable is bound by the judgment <u>if the
former had notice of the criminal case and could have de­fended it had he seen fit
to do so, and that otherwise such judgment is only prima facie evidence</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After very careful reflection, we have arrived at the opinion
that <u>the judgment of conviction, in the absence of any collusion between the
defendant and the offended party, should bind the person <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stigma of a criminal
conviction surpasses in effect and implications mere civil liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Com­mon sense dictates that a finding of
guilt in a criminal case <u>in which proof beyond reasonable</u> doubt is neces­sary,
should not be nullified in a subsequent civil ac­tion requiring only <u>preponderance
of evidence</u> to sup­port a judgment, unless those who support the contrary
rule should also hold that an absolution in a civil case will operate to
automatically set aside the verdict against the defendant in the criminal
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is anomalous, to say the least,
to suppose that the driver, excelling 'Dr. <span class="SpellE">Jekyl</span> and
Mr. Hyde', could be guilty of reckless negli­gence <u>in so far as his
obligation to pay indemnity is concerned</u>, and at the same time could be
free from blame when said indemnity is <u>sought to be collected from his
employer, although the right to the indemnity arose from and was based on one
and the same act of the driver</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The employer cannot be said to have been de­prived of his day
in court, because the situation before us is <u>not</u> one wherein the
employer is sued for a <u>pri­mary</u> liability under article 1903 of the
Civil Code, but one in which enforcement is sought of a <u>subsidiary</u>
"civil liability incident to and dependent upon his driver's <u>criminal</u>
negligence which is a proper issue to be tried and decided only in a <u>criminal</u>
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <u>the employer
becomes ipso facto <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable up­on his
driver's conviction and upon proof of the latter's insolvency, in the same way
that acquittal wipes out not only the employee's primary civil liability but
also his employer's subsidiary liability for such criminal negligence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These views were reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Nagrampa</span>
v. Mulvaney<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Orsal</span> v. Alisbo.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although conceding that the sum of P3,161 awarded as actual
damages "is not too excessive," appellant maintains that it is
"unreasonable and ought to be reduced." Actual damages is, however, a
question of fact, and the findings thereon of the Court of Appeals, adopting
those of the trial court, are conclusive upon us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant likewise impugns the awards to plaintiff of P5,000 as
moral damages, P12,000 as compensatory damages and P1,000 as attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection therewith, the Court
of Appeals, after quoting the findings of the court of origin on the facts and
circumstances justifying said awards, had the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>"Bearing in mind that in crimes, the defend­ant is liable for
all damages which are the natural and probable consequences of the act or
omission complained of, including loss or impairment of earn­ing capacity of
the offended party and injury to his business standing or commercial credit as
well as compensation for physical pain and suffering and mental anguish, which
was a gap in our legal system, filled in by the new Civil Code, and that
attorney's fees are recoverable in a separate action to recover civil liability
arising from crime, and considering that appellant has not adduced compelling
reasons to justify us in disturbing the abovementioned find­ings of the lower
court, by substituting ours for its sound discretion, exercised in the light of
the facts and circumstances obtaining in this case as observed by it, the said
last three assigned errors of appellant are likewise declared without
sufficient merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon a review of the record, we do not feel justified in dis­turbing
the conclusions reached by the appellate court and the court of origin.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note that "actual" damages and
"consequential damages" are dealt with in the Civil Code of the Philippines
under the same Chapter thereof;<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a> that the two (2) terms are thus
used therein as equivalent to one another; and that the decision appealed had
characterized as "actual damages the expenses incurred by the plaintiff
for his medical treatment and as "compensatory damages" the earnings
he failed to make due to his consequent "inability to pursue his normal
work or occupation."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering,
however, that in the language of Article 2200 of said Code, which is part of
the aforementioned Chapter 2 — "indemnification for damages shall
comprehend not only the value of the loss suffered" — otherwise known as
"<span class="SpellE">damnum</span> <span class="SpellE">emergens</span>,"
and alluded to in said decision as "actual damages" "but also
that of the profits which the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> failed to
obtain" — or "<span class="SpellE">lucrum</span> <span class="SpellE">cessans</span>"
or "compensatory damages, " pursuant to the same decision — the
distinction therein made appears to be inconsequential, insofar as the law and
this case is concerned.</p>
