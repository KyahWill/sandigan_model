of the Workmen's Compensation Commission in Workmen's Compensation Commission
Case No.</span> ROX I-9545, denying the claim of petitioner Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Galler</span>
for compensation benefits for the death of her husband <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galler</span> against respondent Philippine Packing
Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Galler</span>
during his lifetime was an employee of the respondent Philippine Packing
Corporation for the last 17 years as a field worker until his death on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He used to work for eight (8) hours a day for
6 days a week at an average weekly wage of P31.68.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As field worker he performed such manual job
as weeding, harvesting, stripping, <span style="">putting
fertilizer on the pineapple plants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this kind of work, he was exposed to the elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Weeks before his death he
had been complaining of pains in the chest, back and nape.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact this was the very same complaint the
night before he died on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="5"><span style="">May 17, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time of his death, he left his wife Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Galler</span>, and five minor children, namely, <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span>, Manuel, <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> and Alberto, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Galler</span>,
who in due time filed a claim for compensation for the death of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Galler</span> which respondent
Philippine Packing Corporation <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> on the
ground that the ailment of which the deceased died was not compensable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After considering all the
evidence presented by both parties, the Acting Referee rendered its decision,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On appeal to the
Workmen's Compensation </span>Commission, the decision of the Acting Referee
was reversed and the respondent Philippine Packing Corporation absolved from
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reversing the decision of
the Acting Referee, the respondent Commission did not give much weight to the
testimony of the petitioner that the deceased has been com­plaining of pains in
his chest, back and nape which had bothered him for months before he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Commission simply deduced that
such pains in the chest, back and nape were just the result of muscle fatigue
from work and that these pains cannot be considered symptoms referable to the
heart or pancreas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the
respondent Commission even granting without conceding that the cause of the
death of the deceased was heart attack and not hemorrhage <span class="SpellE">pancreatitis</span>,
still it cannot be considered that the cause of death of the deceased was due
to his employment because there is no medical evidence that he had already the
heart disease before he died and also because his death occurred while he was
sleeping and after he had already been <span style="">10
hours away from his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its </span>decision,
the respondent Commission maintained that <span style="">since
there is no </span>history of extraordinary effort exerted or any accident that
could have brought about the death of the deceased during his sleep, it cannot
be presumed that his death was caused or aggravated by the nature of his
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A review of the records,
however, shows that the deceased has been working with the respondent for the
last 17 years until the time of his death and that by the nature of his work he
was exposed to the elements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The work of
weeding, stripping and harvesting and putting fertilizers to the plant under
the sun and rain is no easy matter and certainly not to the human body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When according to the evidence of the
petitioner, the deceased complained of pains in the chest, back and nape,
months before he died, and in fact there were few occasions when the deceased
was given a medical tag and was able to consult at the respondent's <span class="SpellE">Philipps</span> Memorial Hospital, it could be that the pains he
suffered in the back, neck and nape were but the symptoms of an illness which
set in during the course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could not just be the result of muscle fatigue or hard work in the
field for if such pains were due to muscle fatigue only, he could have felt
them even during the time he started working with the respondent while performing
the same kind of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show
that the deceased had been working with the respondent for 17 years doing the
same kind of work and yet he never complained of such pains in the chest, back
and nape until only few months before his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever may be the cause of such pains, the
fact is that the deceased died of an illness earlier manifested by said pains
which according to the one who prepared the Death Certificate was "<span class="SpellE">Bangungot</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the doctor who prepared the Death Certificate of the
deceased did not conduct an autopsy of the body of the latter, his
certification as to the cause of death cannot be conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not preclude the possibility that it
could have been an ailment different from "<span class="SpellE">Bangungot</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in a question propounded
to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> as to the possible cause of death of the
deceased, he answered that it might be possible that the deceased may not have
died of a cause as stated in the Death Certificate but may be due to heart
failure or heart attack which definitely the deceased did not have before he
was employed by respondents but which could have come only during the last few
months of his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, it is now settled that the employer has the burden of
disproving by substantial evidence the strong presumption that an illness which
supervened during employment arose out of the employment or was at least
aggravated by it.</p>

<p class="BODY">As was stressed by former Chief <span style="">Justice </span><span class="SpellE">Querube</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Visayan</u></span><u> Stevedore &amp; Transportation
Co. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the mere opinion of doctors presented by the employer that would disconnect the
deceased employee's death from his employment cannot prevail over the
presumption established by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He aptly
explained the rationale for the Court's liberal attitude in upholding the legal
presumption of compensability in workmen's compensation cases in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"The liberal attitude displayed by this Court in considering
as compensable the death by heart attack of an <u>off-duty</u> employee helping
in the loading operation of a vessel (William Lines, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Sañopal</span>, 42 SCRA 48), or the disappearance of an <u>off-duty</u>
crew member of a vessel who had no choice but to be in the vessel during the
voyage (<span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> Shipping Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, 18 SCRA 1028), or the death by drowning of an
employee whose duty was to watch over and take charge of a barge in the absence
of the <u>patron</u> (Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation
Commission, 10 SCRA 207), proceeds from an awareness of the fact that <u>when
an employee undertakes to satisfy, in the course of employment, certain human
wants,</u> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">i</span></span><span style="">. </span>e. <u>eating</u>, <u>freshening</u>
up, <u>sleeping</u> and the like, 'and something takes place that may cause <u>injury</u>,
<u>harm</u> or <u>death</u> to the employee or laborer, it is <u>fair</u> and <u>logical</u>
that <u>the happening be considered</u> as one <u>occurring in the course of
employment</u> for under the circumstances it cannot be undertaken in any other
way' (Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, <u>supra</u>),
unless it can be clearly shown that the mishap occurred because the employee
acted beyond his duty or outside the course of employment, which is not so in
the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For aside from the
conclusion arrived at by the medico-legal officer who conducted the autopsy
that '<span class="SpellE">bangungot</span>' was the cause of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Labiyo's</span> death, there was hardly anything else that would
disconnect the deceased's death from his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioner had not proved
that death was not and could not be caused or aggravated by the deceased's work
as engineer who, at the time of his death, was practically on 24-hour continuous
duty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records do not show that the respondent has discharged its burden
and overcome by substantial evidence the legal presumption of compensability of
the illness of the de­ceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have noted that the death compensation awarded by the referee
is not in accordance with that provided by Section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased having been survived
by a widow and five minor children they are entitled to full death compensation
of P6,000.00 (60% for the widow and 40% for the five dependent children).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the widow shall be paid P200.00
for burial expenses and her counsel shall be entitled to a payment of 10% of
the compensation awarded, by way of attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrative fee provided by Section 55
of the Act shall likewise be paid by respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of the respondent Commission is
hereby reversed and set aside and another one rendered, ordering private
respondent:</p>

<blockquote>(1) To pay petitioner and her five minor children the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (60% for the widow and 40% for the five dependent
children) as death compensation benefits;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) To reimburse petitioner of the medical and hospital expenses
supported by re­ceipts of payment;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) To pay the petitioner the sum of P200.00 for burial expenses of
the deceased employee;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) To pay petitioner's lawyer the sum of P600.00 as attorney's fees;
and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(5) To pay the sum of P61.00 as administrative fees.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
