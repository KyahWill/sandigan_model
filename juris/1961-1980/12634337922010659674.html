demonstrate beyond doubt that the remedy prayed for must be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This litigation started with private
respondent Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> filing a verified complaint
on December 12, 1972 with the then National Labor Relations Commission,
charging petitioner <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
with violating the constitution of the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Labor
Union by refusing, as its president, to call for the election of officers in
the month of November, 1972, and praying that such election be conducted
immediately.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Upon receipt of such verified complaint
on January 9, 1973, petitioner on the same date sent an urgent telegram to the
respondent National Labor Relations Commission for the cancellation of the
hearing of such complaint set for January 12, 1973 as he had to appear on that
very day before the then Court of Industrial Relations, a formal motion to such
effect being filed on January 11, 1973.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Petitioner was not informed of the action taken

a petition with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
Branch No. VII, <span class="SpellE">Balayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
docketed as Civil Case No. 942 for prohibition with a writ of preliminary
injunction, against the respondent Domingo <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> and
the National Labor Relations Commission and the Secretary of Labor, seeking to
annul the order of January 30, 1973 and to prohibit the respondent National

Angeles, now retired, did not grant the writ of preliminary injunction <u>ex</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>as prayed for in the petition but
instead set the application thereof for hearing on March 1, 1973 with due

On the <span style="">same </span>date, shortly before
noon and within the court premises, petitioner was served with a copy of a
subpoena dated February 28, 1973 issued by respondent <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, Chairman of the then National Labor
Relations Commission, requiring him to appear at the National Labor Relations
Commission, Department of Labor, 3rd Floor, Phoenix Building, <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>, Manila, on March 2, 1973, at 2:00 o'clock in
the afternoon to explain why he should not be held in contempt for trying to
use old society tactics to prevent a union election duly ordered by the Commission
under Presidential Decree 21 and, with Judge Jaime <span class="SpellE">delos</span>
Angeles, at the same time and date, more or less, being served with a copy of
the subpoena also requiring him to appear likewise before the respondent
National Labor Relations Commission, to explain why he should not be held in
contempt for trying to use old society tactics to prevent a union election duly
ordered by the Commission under the aforesaid Presidential Decree 21.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case was filed on March 2, 1973 and on March 6, 1973, this
Court issued this resolution:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Considering the allegations contained, the issues raised and the
arguments adduced in the petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction,
the Court Resolved:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) to require the
respondents to file an [answer] thereto within ten (10) days from notice
hereof, and not to move to dismiss the petition; and (b) to have a [temporary
restraining order issued], effective immediately until further orders from this
Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a letter from respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> dated
March 14, 1973, received in the Supreme Court on March 15 which, to say the
least, is impressed with unorthodoxy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
reads in full <span style="">as </span>follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This refers to your summons in
connection with G.R. No. L-36385 requiring me to <span style="">file </span>an answer to the petition for prohibition of the preliminary
injunction within ten (10) days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First of all, the issue is not [sic] academic since we do not intend to
continue with the contempt proceedings against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
union election has been held in accordance with our order and the winner duly
proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, the Supreme Court
has no jurisdiction over us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enclosed is
a copy of Presidential Decree 21 for your information and guidance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, under the New Society, we are evolving
a de-legalized labor management system <span style="">in
</span>this country, and we expect the fullest cooperation of the Supreme Court
in this endeavor."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the Supreme Court, on March 22, 1973, took him to task in this
resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Considering the letter
of Chairman <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
of the National Labor Relations Commission, filed with reference to the
resolution of March 6, 1973, requiring the respondents to answer the petition
herein, stating in chief that the issue evolved in this case is now academic and
that the Court has no jurisdiction over the Commission in view of the
Presidential Decree No. 21, the Court Resolved:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) to [expunge] said letter from the records of this case; and (b) to
require said respondent to [comply] with this Court's resolution of March 6,
1973, within five (5) days from notice hereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let the Secretary of Labor be [furnished] with a copy of the letter of
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> and
the resolution of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1973</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
An answer was filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1973</st1:date>,
counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> reiterating that the
case had become moot and academic as he had no intention of enforcing the
contempt citation and alleging that the power to punish for contempt was
provided for under Sections 7 and 10 of Presidential Decree No. 21.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Both petitioner and respondents were required to submit their respective
memoranda, but as neither did so, the case was deemed submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth at the outset, prohibition lies.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, the plea that
a case had become moot and academic would be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
made clear that he would quash the contempt citation, then this litigation
could have been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
what was set forth by him in the letter had to be expunged, not so much because
of its offensive tone but much more so by its lack of appreciation for what the
law ordains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no retreat from
his indefensible position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that was
alleged was that he would not enforce the contempt citation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
answer </span>filed by him was of the same tenor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable then why this Court in
the resolution above-cited, as well as in the resolution requiring that
memoranda be submitted by the parties, was of the belief that the legal issues
presented should be decided.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We start with a
fundamental postulate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in
Villegas v. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
"Nothing is better settled in the law than that a public official
exercises power, not rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
government itself is merely an agency through which the will of the state is
expressed and enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its officers
therefore are likewise agents entrusted with the responsibility of discharging
its functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such there is no
presumption that they are empowered to act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be a delegation of such authority, either express or
implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of a valid
grant, they are devoid of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
they do suffers from a fatal infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That principle cannot be sufficiently stressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * Neither the high dignity of the office
nor the righteousness of the motive then is an acceptable substitute. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Otherwise the rule of law becomes a myth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an eventuality, we must take all pains
to avoid."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The undeniable concern of respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> that the
objectives of Presidential Decree No. 21 be attained thus afforded no warrant
for exercising a power not conferred by such decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ought to have known that the competence
"to hold any person in contempt for refusal to comply"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
certainly cannot extend to a judge of the court of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correctly construed, it cannot cover the case
likewise of a party to a controversy who took the necessary steps to avail
himself of a judicial remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must
ever be borne in mind by an administrative official that courts exist precisely
to assure that there be compliance with the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the very essence of a judicial
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the rule of law requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that courts, like any other
governmental agencies, must observe the limits of its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, it is admitted that
the then Judge Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles, after hearing the
arguments on the propriety of issuing the writ of preliminary injunction prayed
for, reserved his resolution in view of the intricacies of the legal questions
raised.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The proper step for an administrative official then is to seek a dismissal of
the case before the court precisely on the ground that the matter did not fall
within the domain of the powers conferred on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
took the precipitate step of citing him for contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was an affront to reason as well as a
disregard of well-settled rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
was there any contumacious act committed by petitioner in seeking judicial
remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a reproach to any
legal system if an individual is denied access to the courts under these
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resort of respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> to what has been derisively referred to as
epithetical jurisprudence, seeking shelter in the oppro­brious term "old
society tactics," is an implied admission of his actuation being devoid of
support in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so well stated by
Chief Justice Hughes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It must be
conceded that departmental zeal may not be permitted to outrun the authority
conferred by statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>
