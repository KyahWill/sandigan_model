<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is a petition to review the 
decision of the Court of Appeals. The facts are summarized in the following 
portion of the appealed decision: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It appears that on July 21, 
1952, insolvent Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> and his wife Maria 
<span class="SpellE">Manio</span> executed a deed of absolute sale whereby they 
sold three parcels of land in question [situated in the barrios of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mataas-na-Kahoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bangad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City] in favor 
of Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span>, 
the deed having been duly recorded in the registry of deeds of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> and the corresponding 
titles issued in the latter's name. On the same date both parties entered into a 
so-called memorandum-agreement by virtue of which the insolvent and his wife 
were given until December 31, 1952, the right to repurchase parcels of land for 
P10,000, the memorandum agreement appearing in a private document. On 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="16" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 16, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
before the period for repurchase had expired, Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> sold by way of 
absolute sale for the sum of P9000 the three parcels of land in question in 
favor of appellants who are brothers-in-law of insolvent [insolvent's wife, 
Maria <span class="SpellE">Manio</span>, being a sister of petitioner Claudia 
<span class="SpellE">Manio</span>]. Said insolvent and his wife, on their part, 
executed on </span><st1:date month="9" day="2" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 2, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, a 
deed of absolute sale for P3<span class="GramE">,500</span> of the two-story 
residential house in question [situated at </span><st1:address><st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">37 <span class="SpellE">Sanciangco</span> Street</span></st1:street><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, </span><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cabanatuan</span></span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> City in favor of 
appellants."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To this narration should be added 
the fact that on </span><st1:date month="10" day="21" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 21, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
that is, five days after the supposed sale of the lands to petitioners, Enrique 
<span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> filed a petition for voluntary insolvency. 
Respondent Mario S. Garcia was subsequently appointed assignee in the insolvency 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1952"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 10, 
1952</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
respondent Garcia filed this case in the Court of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> to recover from 
petitioners the ownership and possession of the lands and the house. He alleged 
that the redemption of the lands was made by the insolvent through petitioners 
"to prevent the said three parcels of land from coming into the hands of the 
assignees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> or prevent 
the same from being distributed ratably among the creditors of the insolvent, or 
defeat the object of, or hinder, delay or obstruct the operation of this 
insolvency proceedings, and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> de la Paz and 
Claudia <span class="SpellE">Manio</span> [petitioners] knew at the time of the 
transfer of the said three parcels of land that Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> was insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency 
and the transfer of the said parcels of land was not made in the ordinary and 
usual course of business of the said Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span>." Respondent Garcia averred that the transfer of 
the house to petitioners was made for the same purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the other hand, petitioners 
contended that the transfers of the parcels of land from the insolvent to Patria 
<span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> and thence 
to them were made in good faith and for valuable consideration and were recorded 
in the registry of deeds and that, in fact, titles were issued to <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> and to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Simplicio</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Lising</span> 
likewise intervened but it is unnecessary to detail here his claim since it was 
dismissed by the trial court whose decision became final when <span class="SpellE">Lising</span> failed to file a brief in the Court of 
Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After hearing, the lower court 
declared the transfers null and void. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners appealed to the Court 
of Appeals but they again lost. Hence this appeal. Petitioners' arguments are 
based on Civil Code provisions on <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> 
contracts. Thus they contend -<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(1) That under article 1381(3) a 
sale may be rescinded if it is in fraud of creditors but that since petitioners 
derived their title not from the insolvent but from Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span>, the sale to them 
can not be rescinded without first rescinding the sale to <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(2) That the sale to <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> cannot be rescinded without making her a party to 
this action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(3) That the sale to petitioners 
cannot be rescinded because it has not been shown that the creditors of the 
insolvent cannot recover in any other way, as required by article 
1383.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(4) That, pursuant to article 
1385, the appellate court should have ordered the return of the price which 
petitioners paid for the lands and the house, with interest, because rescission 
requires mutual restitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners, in our opinion, have 
missed the point. The decision of the Court of Appeals is based not on the Civil 
Code but on the Insolvency Law (Act No. 1956) which declares certain transfers 
to be fraudulent and regards them not merely <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> but absolutely null and void. Respondent Garcia 
brought this suit on the theory that the purchase of the properties by 
petitioners on October 16, 1952 was in reality redemption by Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> who, only five days later, was to file a petition 
for voluntary insolvency, and that this scheme was resorted to in an effort to 
place the properties beyond the reach of <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton's</span> 
creditors. This theory was upheld by the appellate court. This is clear from the 
following passage of its decision: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"[A]<span class="SpellE">ppellants</span> contend that the sale of the three parcels of land 
under controversy in favor of Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> was made by the insolvent in good faith and for a 
valuable consideration several months before he was declared insolvent by the 
lower court. <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> [respondent Garcia] maintains, 
however, that it appearing that on October 20, 1952, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> had petitioned for voluntary insolvency, the 
transaction was fraudulent considering the circumstances surrounding the same. 
We agree with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in this respect. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" The Court of Appeals likewise 
held the transfer of the house fraudulent for having been made within 30 days of 
the filing of a petition for insolvency.<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is clear, therefore, that the 
provisions of the Civil Code on <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> contracts 
(which assume the validity of the contract) cannot be invoked since, as already 
stated, the Insolvency Law regards the contracts void. Consequently, it is idle 
to talk of restitution, exhaustion of the debtor's properties, sources of title, 
etc. on which petitioners elaborate arguments are based. Nor is the presence of 
Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> 
indispensable in this proceedings. The rule is very well explained by Moran 
thus: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In an action for rescission of 
sale because of non-payment of price, or for annulment of a sale of property, 
the vendee is an indispensable party. In action for recovery of property against 
a person who purchased it from another who in turn acquired it from others by 
the same means or by donation or otherwise, these predecessors of defendants are 
indispensable parties should the transfers, if not voided, be binding upon 
plaintiff. But, where the transfers are immaterial to plaintiff's title he 
having taken no part in any one of them, transferors are not indispensable or 
necessary parties, although they may be joined by defendant by a third party 
complaint to enforce the warranty for eviction." (1 Moran 148-149 
[1963])<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here, respondent Garcia brought 
the action as assignee who took no part in the alleged transactions between 
petitioners and their transferors or predecessors. As such, he could bring this 
action even against petitioners only as the parties in possession of the 
properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This brings us to the heart of 
the matter. Section 70 of the Insolvency Law considers as fraudulent any 
transfer of properties made by the insolvent within 30 days of the filing by or 
against him of a petition for insolvency, unless the transfer is for valuable 
pecuniary consideration and is made in good faith. In holding the transfer of 
the lands and the house in question void for being fraudulent, the Court of 
Appeals said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In the first place, appellant 
Claudia <span class="SpellE">Manio</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Manio</span>, insolvent's wife, are sisters. In the second place, 
Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> 
allegedly purchased the three parcels of land from the insolvent for P10,000 and 
yet she sold them to appellants for P9000 only at a time when the period of 
repurchase by the insolvent and his wife had not expired. In the third place, it 
was indeed a rare coincidence that Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> should have sold the parcels of land originally 
belonging to the insolvent and his wife to the latter's brother-in-law and half 
sister for an amount less then what she had paid when she acquired them. In the 
fourth place, if the purpose of the sale made by the insolvent was perfectly 
legal, we see no reason why in the same date he and Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> had to execute a 
private document known as memorandum agreement so as to give the former an 
option to repurchase the parcels of land. By so doing, we believe that the 
insolvent and appellants wanted to hide the real purpose of the transaction, 
which could have been no other than to prevent the insolvent's creditors from 
taking hold of the parcels of land in question. That this was the real purpose 
is strengthened by the fact that one Miguel <span class="SpellE">Veneracion</span> 
who had deposited <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in the insolvent 's warehouse 
found himself without his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> as he did not see it 
anymore when he went there and instead saw insolvent's wife and her sister, 
appellant Claudia <span class="SpellE">Manio</span>, who informed him that they 
were looking for buyers for the parcels of land in question in order to settle 
with all claimants and depositors of the insolvent out of the proceeds of the 
sale after paying the credit of Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> in the amount of P10,000. Later on <span class="SpellE">Veneracion</span> found out, however, that the parcels of lands 
were transferred to appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"As to the sale of the two-story 
residential house, appellants claim that it could not have been in fraud of 
creditors since it was executed on September 2, 1952, beyond the 30-day period 
from the filing of the petition for insolvency. Such a claim merits no serious 
consideration it appearing that the deed of sale was recorded in the registry of 
deeds on October 15, 1952, that is, only six days before the petition for 
voluntary insolvency was filed by Enrique <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners dispute the finding 
of fraud and argue that the relationship which the petitioners bear to the 
insolvent, instead of justifying a finding of fraud, support the inference that 
petitioners probably decided to buy the lands in question from Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> to forestall the 
possibility of their passing into the hands of other parties in the event <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> was unable to repurchase his 
properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is true that in one case 
(Flores v. Faustino, 55 Phil. 594 [1931]), this Court said that mere 
relationship is not "necessarily fraud." But relationship can be, when taken 
together with other circumstances.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[1]</span></sup></span> Here the appellate court 
did not consider relationship standing alone. The time between the supposed 
purchase and the filing of the petition for insolvency; the price at which the 
properties were sold; the sisters' representation that they were looking for 
buyers of the properties at a time when the properties were supposed to be no 
longer the properties of the insolvent - it was in this context that 
relationship was viewed as indicating fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners try to explain the 
difference between the price at which Patria <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> supposedly bought the lands (P10,000) and the 
price at which she sold them to petitioners (P9,000) by contending that as 
owner, <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> could even give the lands free as 
donation. And, "for all we know, <span class="SpellE">Gatbonton</span> paid 
valuable consideration for that right to redeem, and his consideration could be 
the difference between P10,000 that <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> paid him, 
and the price of P9,000 that she received from appellants when she resold the 
same lands to them."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Suffice it to say that there is 
absolutely no evidence that <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> was motivated by 
generosity in making a sale at a financial sacrifice. Nor is there evidence that 
the difference between the price at which <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> 
bought the lands and the price at which she sold them to petitioners represents 
the price paid for the right of redemption. This is merely a conjecture which 
invites an equally plausible conjecture, namely, that the transaction between 
the insolvent and <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span> was in truth a loan for 
P9,000, the amount of P1,000 being interest in excess of that allowed by law. 
This might explain why the insolvent's right to redeem was embodied in a private 
document. This might likewise explain the conduct of the sisters Maria and 
Claudia <span class="SpellE">Manio</span> in offering the properties for sale when 
at that time the same properties were supposed to be properties of <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span>. Indeed, the Civil Code states in article 1603 that 
"In case of doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with a right to repurchase 
shall be construed as an equitable mortgage."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">And what of the transfer of the 
insolvent's house to petitioners? It is claimed that the sale was made on 
September 2, 1952 and that for purposes of determining whether the transfer was 
made within the 30 day period in section 70 of the Insolvency Law, that date and 
not the date of registration of the sale (October 14, 1952) should be 
considered. For this purpose, petitioners invoke <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, G. R. No. 
L-13646, July 26, 1960 for authority that "there is no registry of buildings in 
this jurisdiction apart from the lands on which they stand, so that there is no 
legal compulsion to register, as notice to third persons, transactions over or 
dealings on buildings that do not belong to the owners of the lands on which 
they stand." There may indeed be no separate register for buildings, but this 
does not mean that transactions regarding buildings may not be recorded in the 
registry of deeds where the land, on which the buildings are erected, is 
registered. And there may indeed be no legal duty to register such transactions, 
but, if notwithstanding the absence of such a duty the vendee registers the sale 
to him of a building, as the petitioners in this case did, then he cannot escape 
the effects of the registration. (See <span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Code arts. 
708-709. Cf. Associated Ins. &amp; Surety Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Iya</span>; 
<span class="SpellE">Iya</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Valino</span>, 56 O.G. 948 
[1957]). The appellate court correctly considered the date of registration of 
the sale to petitioners in determining whether the sale is prohibited by the 
Insolvency Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is
