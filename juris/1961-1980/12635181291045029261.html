the complaint in Criminal Case No. 81257 allegedly for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="1">22 January 1966</st1:date>,
Hong Din <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> was charged with grave oral defamation
before the Court of First Instance of Manila (Criminal Case No. 81257) in <span class="GramE">an information</span> reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 21st day of November, 1965, in the City
of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with the malicious purpose of
impeaching the virtue, honor, charac­ter and reputation of one Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Japco</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully, felon­iously and publicly proffer in the presence of
many people against <span class="SpellE">Mercades</span> <span class="SpellE">Japco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> the following abusive and slanderous remarks and
expressions, to writ: 'Your daughter is a prostitute and she is a prostitute
because you too are a prostitute', and other words and phrases of similar
import which insinuations and imputations, as the said accused well know, were
entirely false and untrue and without foundation in fact whatsoever, highly
offensive and derogatory to her good name, character and virtue, thereby
imputing to the said Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Japco</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, a married woman of chaste virtues, good moral
character and of high, social standing, unchaste acts, loose virtues, tending
to bring said Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Japco</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
into public discredit, disrepute, contempt and ridicule, as she was in
fact-brought into public discredit, disrepute, contempt, and ridicule.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law.”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Arraigned on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="12">28
 December 1966</st1:date> the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing of the case was postponed several
times, upon representation of counsel for the accused that serious efforts were
being exerted by friends of both parties to effect an amicable settlement of
their difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="4">14 April 1967</st1:date>, the accused moved for
the dismissal or <span class="SpellE">quashal</span> of the information on the
ground that, as it charges defamation consisting of the alleged commission by
the complainant of an offense (adultery) that cannot be prosecuted <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u> the case should have been initiated at the
instance of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show
that the information in the case was file by on assistant city fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
without the signature of the supposed complainant or offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 8 May 1967 and over the objection of the prosecution, the
trial court ordered the dismissal of the case, as prayed or by the accused
reasoning that under Section 8 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court a case
for defamation On involving an offense that cannot be prosecute of <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u> has to be made out upon the complaint of the
offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the accused was
alleged to have imputed to the complainant, a married, woman, the commission of
acts of prostitution, the former, in effect, charged the latter with adultery,
and the information, therefore, cannot be filed by the fiscal without the
signature of the supposed offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this order of dismissal, the prosecution interposed the
present appeal, claiming that the allegations of the complaint charged the
accused of having specifically imputed upon the offended party the commission
of the crime of prostitution, which is a public crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conse­quently, according to herein appellant,
the information, signed and filed by the Assistant City Fiscal even without the
signature of the said offended party, was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We incline to agree with this contention of the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the pertinent legal provisions on the matter (Section 4,
Rule 110, revised Rules of Court, last paragraph; Article 360, Revised Penal
ode, last paragraph),<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
no criminal <span class="GramE">action</span> for de­famation or slander
consisting in the imputation of an offense that cannot be prosecuted <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>, such as adultery, <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>,
se­duction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall be filed except
upon the complaint of the offended party in the slander case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue in this proceeding, therefore,
hinges on the nature of the act or activity that was imputed by the accused
upon the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did the alleged
defamatory remark imputed on the offended party the commission of a public
crime or of a private offense that cannot be prosecuted <u>de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>?<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered in this connection that what determines the
offense of which the accused stands charged are the allegations in the
information,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the actual recital of facts made therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information in this case averred that the
accused, with the malicious purpose of impeaching the virtue, honor, character
and reputation of Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Japco</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
a married woman, uttered against the latter, publicly and in the presence of
many people, the remarks - "Your daughter<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
is a prostitute and she is a prostitute because you too are a
prostitute".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As thus alleged, it is
clear that, while the utterance in effect also imputed on her the commission of
adultery, the offended party being a married woman, the disreputable conduct
she was particularly charged with was the crime of prostitution, not
adultery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it may be pointed out that
prostitution and adultery are not one and the same thing; the first is a crime
against public morals, committed by a woman, whether married or not, who, for
money or profit, habitually indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious
conduct,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
whereas adultery is in the nature of a private offense committed by a married
woman who shall have sexual intercourse with a man not her husband.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the essential element in
prostitution is not simply a woman's entering into marital relations with a man
other than her husband, if she happens to be married, but the existence of
pecuniary or financial gain as inducement to, or consideration for, that
woman's engaging in sexual activities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, to call a married woman a prostitute is not merely to proclaim her
an adulteress, a violator of her marital vows; it is to charge her of having
committed an offense against public morals, of moral de­generacy far exceeding
that involved in the maintenance of adulterous relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing from the recital of the information that the alleged
defamatory remark by the accused specifically imputed upon the of­fended party
the commission of prostitution, which is a public crime that can be prosecuted <u>de
<span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>, the information filed under the sig­nature
of the Assistant City Fiscal duly conferred jurisdiction upon the lower court
to try the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order of dismissal is hereby set aside,
and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
