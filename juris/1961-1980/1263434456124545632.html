Ramiro <span class="SpellE">Alegre</span>, who was then living with rela­tives in

the stolen pieces of jewelry, he admitted his participation in the kill­ing and
robbery of <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Sajo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appears in his extrajudicial confession

Fernandez, "<span class="SpellE">Rami</span>" and
"Mario".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said

extrajudicial confession of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cudillan</span>, an Information for Robbery with Homicide was
filed by the Special Counsel of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">Appellants now contend that the lower court erred in utilizing
the extrajudicial confessions <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cudillan</span> (now deceased)

<p class="BODY">The extrajudicial confessions of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cudil­lan</span> (Exhibits "A", "A-1" to

As a general rule, the extrajudicial declaration of an accused, although
deliberately made, is not admissible and does not have probative value against
his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely hearsay
evidence as far as the other accused are concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">While there are recognized exceptions
to this rule, the facts and circumstances attendant in the case at bar do not
bring it within the purview of such exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only evidence, therefore, linking the appellants to the crime would
be their purported tacit admissions and/or failure to deny their impli­cations
of the crime made by <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cudillan</span>,
and/or their purported verbal confessions to Hernando <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>,

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question to be resolved is whether or not the silence of
appellants while under police custody, in the face of statements of Melecio
Cudillan implicating them as his companions in the commission of the crime,
could be considered as tacit admission on their part of their participation
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The settled rule is that the silence of an ac­cused in criminal
cases, meaning his failure <span class="GramE">or</span> re­fusal to testify, may
not be taken as evidence against him,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and that he may refuse to answer an incriminating question.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It has also been held that while an accused is under custody, his silence may
not be taken as evidence against him as he has a right to remain silent; his
silence when in custody may not be used as evidence against him, other­wise,
his right of silence would be illusory.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

held that the prosecution may not use at trial <span style="">the </span>fact that an individual stood mute, or claimed his privilege
against self-incrimination, in the face of an accu­sation made at a police
custodial interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to <i style=""><span style="">Miranda</span></i><span style="">, </span>it was the
view of many authori­ties that a man to whom a statement implicating him in a crime
is directed may fail to reply if he is in custody under a charge of the
commission of that crime, not because he acquiesces in the truth of the
statement, but because he stands on his constitu­tional right to remain silent,
as being the safest course for him to pursue and the best way <span style="">out </span>of his predicament.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Other courts have held that the circumstance that one is under arrest by itself
does not render the evidence inadmissible, and that an accusation of a crime
calls for a reply even from <span style="">a </span>person
under arrest or in the custody of an officer, where the circumstances
surrounding him indicate that he is free to answer if he chooses.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the better rule is that the silence of an accused
under custody, or his failure to deny statements by another implicating him in
a crime, especially when such accused is neither asked to comment or reply to
such implications or accusations, cannot be considered as a tacit confession of
his participation in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an inference of acquiescence drawn from
his silence or failure to deny the statement would appear incom­patible with
the right of an accused against self-incrimination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right or privilege of a person accused of a crime against
self-incrimination is a fundamental right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a personal right of great importance and is given absolutely and <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
privilege against self-incrimination is an important development in man's
struggle for liberty it re­flects man's fundamental values and his most noble
of aspirations, the unwillingness of civilized men to subject those suspected
of crime to the cruel <span class="SpellE">trilemma</span> of self-accusation,
perjury or contempt; the fear that self-incriminating statements may be
obtained by inhumane treatment and abuses, and the respect for the inviolability
of the human person­ality and of the right of each individual "to a <span style="">private enclave where he may lead a private
life."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Because, it is his right to forego testimony, to remain silent, unless

his own free, genuine will."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed here that even under a regime of martial law,
the operations of our laws governing the rights of an accused person are not
open to doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the code for the
administration of detainees, all officers, civilian and mili­tary personnel are
sworn to uphold the rights of <span style="">detainees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among such fundamental rights are the right
against compulsory testimonial self-incrimi­nation, the right, when under
investigation for the commission of an offense, to remain silent, to have
counsel, and to be informed of his rights; the right not to be subjected to
force, violence, threats, intimidation and degrading punishment or torture in
the course of one's detention, and the safeguard that any confession obtained
in violation of the foregoing rights shall be inadmissible in evidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The 1973 Constitution gives explicit constitutional
sanction to the right to silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
in Section 20 of Article IV of the Constitution, there is this categorical
mandate:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Any person under
investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain
silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Noforce</span>, violence,
threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiates the free will shall be
used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any confess­ion
obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible in evidence."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This privilege against self-incrimination guar­anteed by the
Constitution protects, therefore, the right of a person to remain silent unless
he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer <span style="">no </span>penalty for such silence.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This aspect of the right has been comprehensively ex­plained by then Associate
Justice Enrique M. Fernando, now Chief Justice, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Pascual</i></span><i>
Jr. v. </i><i><span style="">Board of Medi</span>cal </i><i><span style="">Examiners,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The constitutional guarantee protects as well the right to
silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back as 1905, we had
occasion to declare:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The accused has a
perfect right to remain silent and his silence cannot be used as a presumption
of his guilt.' Only last year, in Chavez v. Court of Appeals, speaking through
Justice Sanchez, we reaffirmed the doctrine anew that it is the right of a def­endant
'to forego testimony, to remain silent, unless he chooses to take <span style="">the witness </span>stand ­with undiluted,
unfettered exercise of his own free, genuine will.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Identifying the right of an accused to remain silent with right
to privacy, this Court, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Pascual</i></span>, explained
that the privilege against self-incrimination "enables the citizen to
create a zone of privacy which government may not force to sur­render to its
detriment."</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, therefore, that it was error for the trial court to draw
from appellants' silence while under police custody, in the face of the
incriminatory statements of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cudillan</span>, the conclusion that the aforesaid appellants had
tacitly admitted their guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold,
further, that in view of the inadmissibility of the extrajudicial confessions
of <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cudillan</span>
implicating herein appellants, the remaining evidence against them, consisting
in the testimonies of Sgt. Mariano <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> and Hernando <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>, is insufficient to sustain the judgment of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is inherently
improbable that herein appellants would have readily confessed their
participation in the commission of a heinous crime to a casual acquaintance in
a prison detention cell, considering that on the same occasion they strongly
denied any involvement in such crime before the police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is re­versed, and
