court declaring, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the
decision rendered in a prior civil case No. 34498 between the same parties is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the
present case, and in denying the admission of the third-party complaint filed by
one of the defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts pertinent to the instant <span class="GramE">appeal,</span>
are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1957</st1:date>,
Pedro Bermudez and his sister <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> Bermudez, filed
a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila, docketed as Civil Case <span style="">No. </span>34498, against the spouses Joaquin
Andrade and <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> Martinez Andrade, the spouses Jose
B. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, and Atty. Mariano Z. <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As amended on July 14,1958, the complaint
alleged that plaintiffs are the children of <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
Bermudez who died on March 6, 1943, leaving a parcel of land (described as Lot
13, Block 16-A on subdivision plan Psd-3231) covered by Transfer Certifi­cate
of Title No. 36734, issued under his name, "<span class="SpellE">Apolo­nio</span>
Bermudez, widower", by the Register of Deeds of Manila; that on May 23,
1950, defendant <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> Martinez Andrade - by means of
fraud, deceit and misrepresenta­tion, and taking advantage of the ignorance of
their mother, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin - secured the signature
of the latter on an Affidavit of Adjudication of the land pre­pared by said
defendant with the aid of a lawyer, by virtue of which the land was later
registered in the <span style="">name </span>alone of said <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin;
that on November 11, 1951, defendants Andrade spouses, employing the same
deceit and misrepresentation on <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin,
obtained the signature of the latter once again on a deed of absolute sale,
wherein <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin purportedly sold the land to
Joaquin Andrade; that on 30 January, 1954, Joaquin Andrade then sold the land
to the spouses <span style="">Jose </span><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>; and that by reason of such fraudulent acts of the <span class="SpellE">Andrades</span>, plaintiffs were deprived of their rights to the
property resulting in damage and prejudice to them in the sum of P6,000.00, the
equivalent value of the land for relief, plain­tiffs prayed that the defendants
be sentenced to pay damages in the said amount of P6,000.00, plus P2,000.00 by
way of attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">With prior leave of court, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin filed on <st1:date year="1959" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1959</st1:date>,
a complaint in intervention which <span style="">was </span>amended on <st1:date year="1959" day="8" month="7">July <span style="">8, </span>1959</st1:date>,
wherein she made a common cause with the plaintiffs and reproduced the allega­tions
of plaintiffs' complaint against the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For her own relief, she prayed that
defendants be sen­tenced to pay her P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as
actual damages, P3,000.00 <span style="">as </span>moral damages, P2,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P2,000.00
as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants Andrade spouses filed their answer traversing the
allegations in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As spe­cial
defenses, they alleged that the deed of sale executed by plaintiff-in-intervention,
<span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin in favor of Joaquin Andrade, was “with
the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> full knowledge and realization of the contents
thereof”; and that said vendor received valuable consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> from the buyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And by way of counterclaim, <span style="">said </span>answering defendants <span style="">prayed f</span>or
he sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as damages for malicious
prosecution<span style=""> </span>of the action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> spouses</span><span style="">
also</span><span style=""> </span>answered, <span style="">alleging as </span>a
special defense, that they have acquired the <span style="">land in question in good </span>faith and for
a valuable <span style="">consideration;
</span>and that their title thereto is evidenced by Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 35655 issued<span style=""> in </span>their
names by the Register of Deeds of Manila on February 13, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed for damages against the
plaintiffs by way of counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, defendant attorney, Mariano Z. <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>,
filed his answer denying the material <span style="">allegations of </span>the complaint, with
counterclaim for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a protracted trial on the merits of the case, decision was
rendered on <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1962</st1:date>,
dismissing the amended complaint and the complaint in intervention, as well as
the counterclaim of all the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for reconsideration of the decision filed by the plaintiffs
and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> having been denied, <span style="">said parties </span>interposed
<span style="">appea</span>l<span style=""> </span>from the
said decision to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appeal was dismissed, however, upon their failure to pay the docket
fees and the estimated cost for the printing of the record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the corresponding entry of
final judgment was made on <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="2">February
 19, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not long thereafter, spouses Jose B. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Roxas</span></span><span style=""> and </span><span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> filed a complaint,
docketed <span style="">as
Civil Case No. 53732, in </span>the same Court of First Instance of Manila, to
recover possession of the very land <span style="">involved </span>in the former litigation, from Pedro
Bermudez, <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> Bermudez, and <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin - plaintiffs and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">intervenor</span></span><span style=""> </span>in the
former case No. 34498 - alleging that they (spouses Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>) are the
own­ers of the land in question which <span style="">is </span>occupied by <span style="">Pedro Bermudez, </span><span class="SpellE">Loreta</span>
Bermudez and <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin; and that notwithstanding
demands on said defendants to vacate the <span style="">said </span>property, they have refused and failed
to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs therefore prayed
that defendants be ordered to vacate the land, and to pay <span style="">the plaintiffs the </span>sum
of P10.00 a month as rent for the use and occupation of the land from <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1954</st1:date>, <span style="">plus damages and </span>attorney's
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants answered the complaint, with counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also sought prior leave of the court to
file <span style="">a </span>third party co<span style="">m</span>plaint against <span class="SpellE">Estela</span>
Martinez Andrade, Joaquin Andrade and Atty. Mariano Z. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>
- former defendants in Civil Case No. 34498.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Plaintiffs</span> spouses Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> -
defendants also in the former case - opposed the admis<span style="">sion of the third party complaint against their former co-defendants;
and the said third party complaint was then disallowed by the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, defendants Bermudez and <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin traversed the allegations in the complaint, alleging by way of special
defenses, the same allega­tions in their complaint <span style="">in </span>the former case, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> Martinez Andrade, Joaquin Andrade and Atty. Mariano
Z. <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>, by means of deceit, fraud, misrepre­sentation,
and falsification, and by taking undue advan­tage of the ignorance and age of
the defendants and the pledge then prevailing over the land in question between
<span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin and <span class="SpellE">Estela</span>
Martinez Andrade, were able to secure<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the signature of said <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin on an
Affi­davit of Adjudication in her favor, then on an absolute deed of sale of
the land in favor of Joaquin Andrade, thereby obtaining <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
title in the name of the lat­ter; that said transaction was without
consideration; that the plaintiffs "knew very Well the aforesaid fraud,
deceit, misrepresentation and falsification, together with the fact that the
sale of the land by Joaquin Andrade to <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> was simulated, as shown, among other things, by the
inadequacy of the price in the sup­posed sale".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they now pray, by way of counter­claim,
that the sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin in favor of
Joaquin Andrade, and the subsequent sale executed by the latter in favor of <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, be declared null
and void; and that plaintiffs together with their co­defendants in the former
case (No. 34498) be sentenced to pay moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, decision was rendered by the court below, holding
that plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the land in question, their title
thereto <span style="">being evi­</span>denced by
Transfer Certificate of Title <span style="">No. </span>35655,
is<span style="">sued by the Register of Deeds of
Manila on February 14, 1954; that the allegation of the defendants that they
cannot be ejected from the land involved because they </span>are the owners
thereof, is absolutely without merit, for, being parties in said Civil Case No.
34498, they <span style="">are necessarily bound by
the decision rendered by this </span>Court, which decision is already final and
<span style="">constitutes </span><span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, <span style="">the </span>court
ordered the de­fendants and all other persons living with them "to vacate <span style="">the land therein described, and to pay, jointly
and severally, to the plaintiffs the reasonable rental th</span>ereof <span style="">at the rate of P10.00 a month from </span><st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1957</st1:date>, <span style="">until they vacate the premises, and the fur­ther
</span>sum <span style="">of P200.00 as attorney's
fees."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants have appealed
from the decision </span>to the Court of <span style="">Appeals
which, in a resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">,</span> <span style="">elevated the case to this Court, it appearing from </span>the <span style="">briefs of the parties that only questions of
law are raised therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two main questions of law
are posed by the appellants, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Whether or not the trial court erred in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">declaring that the decision in Civil Case No. 34498 constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the
present </span><span style="">case;
</span><span style="">and </span>(2) whether <span style="">or not the trial court erred in denying
admission of the third party complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In relation to the first proposition,
there can be </span>no <span style="">debate that the
court which had tried and </span>decided <span style="">he
</span>case <span style="">No. 34498, had </span><span style="">jurisdiction over </span><span style="">the parties aid the subject-matter, the
decision rendered therein </span>was on <span style="">the
merits, and the same has become final. Neither can it he disputed that the RES
in said case </span><span style="">No. 3</span>4498 <span style="">is the same
parcel of land involved in the case </span>at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is the contention of
the appellants, however, that the cause of action in said case No. 34498, which
was for recovery of damages, representing the </span><span style="">equiva­</span><span style="">lent value of the
land which the Bermudez and Martin claimed to have been deprived through
deceit, fraud and </span><span style="">misrepresentation,
is </span><span style="">not the same or identical
cause of action involved in the present case, which is for the recovery of
possession of the same land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although, primarily, the
cause of action in said case No. 34498, was for recovery of damages, represent­ing
the equivalent value of the land which the plain­tiffs therein, now appellants
herein, have lost through the alleged fraud, deceit and misrepresentation prac­ticed
</span><span style="">on <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin by the <span class="SpellE">Andrades</span>, nevertheless, it is a fact,
that the issue </span><span style="">of ownership of
the land which was <span class="SpellE">clained</span> by the defendants <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> spouses was intricately involved </span><span style="">in the case, </span><span style="">such that the claim for damages could not be awarded without proof that
the party claiming them had </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">right </span><span style="">to the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof of ownership
of or right to the</span><span style=""> land is </span><span style="">as essential and </span>necessary was that
needed to recover damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
inter-relation of issues, the resulting <span class="GramE">damages was</span>
the effect, and the loss of the land through deceit and fraud was the cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">In civil case No. 34498, the defendants, the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
spouses, have pleaded in their answer and special de­fense that they have
purchased the land in good faith and for value; that they are the owners
thereof; and that their title thereto is evidenced by a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">torrens</span></span> transfer certificate of title No. 35655 of
the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants Andrade spouses <span style="">also </span>traversed
the claim of ownership of the Bermudez and Martin, and contended that the sale
of the land by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin to them was valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the issue posed <span style="">by </span>the plaintiffs in said case No.
34498, was that the deed of sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin to Joaquin An­drade, and that by the latter <span style="">in </span>favor of <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> were secured through fraud and deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon such adverse claim on the land <span style="">by </span>the opposing parties, the court was
called up to determine who <span class="GramE">was the owner thereof</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, however, found that the evidence
sustained the claim of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, and, accord­ingly,
dismissed the amended complaint and the <span class="SpellE">complaint­in</span>-Intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision could not have any other meaning and effect than to
justify the conclusion that said <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of the decision reflected the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court said:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"From the evidence of
the record, the claim of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin, that she was made to sign the affidavit of
adjudication by defend­ant <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> Martinez Andrade by
means of fraud, deceit and misrepresenta­tion and taking advantage of her ignorance
in connivance with defendant Joaquin Andrade and Atty. Mariano Z. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>, before whom said affidavit was ratified, is
absolutely unfound­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
testimony of Atty. Mariano Z. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>, it has clearly
been shown that on May 22, 1959, Domino Martin, accompanied by Joa<span style="">­</span>quin Andrade and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> Martinez <span class="SpellE">Andraded</span>, came to
<span style="">see </span>him
and inquired if she could sell the property des­cribed in Transfer Certificate
of Title No. 36734 of the Office of the Register of Deeds of Manila which was
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Bermudez, widower; Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> told her that she could not sell the property as she
was not its regis­tered owner; however, she asked if it would be possible to have
the property transferred to her name as she was a sister of <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
Bermudez on the mother side and <span style="">she
wanted to sell the </span>property to the <span class="SpellE">Andrades</span>;
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> suggested that it was necessary to secure
an affidavit to that effect, and she left the Torrens Title in his posses­sion
and promised that she would come back <span style="">the
following </span>day; Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> accordingly
prepared the affidavit of adjudication and when <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin came the following day, accompanied again by the <span class="SpellE">Andrades</span>,
and after hav­ing explained to her the contents of <span style="">the affidavit </span>in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>,
she <span style="">readily
signed it; </span><span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> then filed the affidavit of adjudication with the </span><span style="">Office of </span>the Register of Deeds of
Manila for <span style="">the issuance of a new title </span>in
the name of <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin; Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>
was able to <span style="">get </span>a new transfer <span style="">certificate of </span>title in the name of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dominga</span></span><span style=""> Martin which he delivered to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One year afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
</span>Martin came again <span style="">and </span>told
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> <span style="">that
she would like to sell the lot to the <span class="SpellE">Andrades</span>, but
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> said that the </span>property being a
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span> lot, <span style="">it was necessary for her to secure the permission of the Mayor of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. </span><span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>
prepared the necessary request which <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span style="">Martin signed, and it was </span>filed with
the Mayor's Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The re­quest was
approved by the City Mayor <span style="">and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> </span>prepared the correspond­<span style="">ing deed of sale in favor of Joaquin R. </span>Andrade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the <span style="">signing of the deed </span>of sale, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>
brought the docum<span style="">ent to the Office of
the Mayor and it was approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed
of sale was duly registered and a new title was is­</span>sued in the name o<span style="">f J</span>oaquin R. Andrade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin never mentioned to her the fact that
she was the widow of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Bermudez,
and that she had children with him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The evidence further shows that after <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
Martin had secured the transfer certificate of title of the said <span style="">parcel </span>of
land in her name, on <st1:date year="1950" day="11" month="6">June <span style="">11, </span>1950</st1:date>, she received

as the full considera­tion for the sale of the lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then executed in favor of Joaquin R. </span><span style="">Andrade a </span><span style="">deed of absolute sale of said lot on </span><st1:date year="1951" day="16" month="11"><span style="">November 16, 1951</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

the name of the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­after, the <span style="">real </span>estate taxes on said <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> from the
year 1955 have been paid by the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> spouses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the evidence then, the Court is convinced that if there
was any fraud committed here, the <span style="">same
</span>was perpetrated by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin, for she made it appear that she was the
sister on the mother side of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
Bermudez, in order that the lot in question could be adjudicated in her
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She con­cealed the fact that she
was the widow of the said <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Bermudez and with
children with him, who are the plain­tiffs in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, had she revealed such facts, it
would not have been easy for her to dispose of the lot as she intended, her
claim that she only wanted to mortgage the lot instead of selling it rests
merely on her uncorroborated testimony and inasmuch as the transactions here
are all embodied in public documents, the same have in their favor the presump­tion
of regularity as to their due execution and authenticity, and to overcome such
presumption, the evidence must not be merely preponderant but must be clear,
strong, convincing and conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Atty. Mariano Z. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>, the notary
public before whom <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin acknowledged the
affidavit of adjudication <span style="">and </span>the
deed of absolute sale in favor of Joaquin R. Andrade, assured the Court that <span class="SpellE">Do­minga</span> Martin fully understood the nature of the
agreements she was entering into, and his testimony is highly credible coming
as it <span style="">is from</span><span style=""> </span>a notary public who is at the same
time a lawyer, who is supposed to act in accordance with the oath of his
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, such testimony must be
given more credence than that of a party denying a contract acknowledged before
the same notary public."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing considerations, and it clearly appearing that
the connection between the two cases is so intimate' and the parties and the
subject-matter of the controversy being the same in the former <span style="">as </span>well as in the present, We cannot
but conclude that the issue raised herein has really been determined by a
competent court in <span style="">a </span>prior
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even taking the view that the issue of ownership of the land in
said case No. <span class="GramE">34498,</span> was only a second­ary question in
the proceedings before said court, n<span style="">evertheless,
it cannot detract from the conclusive effect of the adjudication of the case,
it being an </span>issue therein, whether <span style="">direct
or collateral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> <span style="">vs. Lim
Bun <span class="SpellE">Hioc</span>, L-6333, Nay 10, 1956.)</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the trial court did not err <span style="">in </span>holding that the <span class="GramE">decision in civil case No.
34498 cons­titute</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the present case.</p>

<blockquote>"A judgment rendered <span style="">by
</span>a court having; jurisdiction of the parties and subject-matter is
conclusive and indisputable evidence as to all rights, questions or facts put <span style="">in </span>issue in
the suit and actually ad­judicated therein when the same came again into
controversy between the same parties or their privies even though according to
the deci­sion of the question, the subsequent proceedings are on a different
cause of action, since the law abhors a multiplicity of suits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another statement of the rule <span style="">is that any right, fact </span>or matter <span style="">in issue, and directly adjudicated </span>on, necessarily involved in,
the determination of an action<span style=""> </span>before
a competent court in which a judgment or decree is rendered on the merits <span style="">is </span>conclusively settled by the
judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and <span style="">privies </span>whether or not the claim or demand,
purpose, or subject-matter of the two suits is the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(50 C.J.S. pp. 168-173.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, it is equally well settled that a fact
which has been directly tried and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
cannot be contested again between the same parties in the same or any other
court, <u>and that where some controlling fact </u><u><span style="">or question </span>material to the de­termination of both actions has
been determined in a former suit, and the fact aga</u><u><span style="">in</span> </u><u><span style="">at issue </span></u><u><span style="">between
the same parties</span></u><span style="">, its adjudication
in the first will, if properly presented, </span>be conclusive of <span style="">the ques­tion in the latter suit, without re</span>gard
to whether the cause of action is the <span style="">same
</span>or not, or whether the second suit involves the same or dif­ferent
subject-matter, or whether or not it <span style="">is
</span>the same form of proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such cases, it is also immaterial that the two actions were based on different
grounds, or tried on differ­ent theories, or <span class="GramE">are</span>
instituted for different purposes, and seek different relief." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">Magsasaka</span>,

<blockquote>"The general rule common to all civilized system of
jurisprudence <span style="">is </span>that the solemn
and deliberate sen­tence of the law, pronounced by <span style="">its </span>appointed organs, upon a disputed fact, or state of facts,
should be re­garded as <span style="">a final </span>and
conclusive deter­mination of the question litigated, and should forever set the
controversy at rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it has been
well, said that this maxim is lore than a rule of law, more even than an
important prin­ciple of public policy and that it <span style="">is a </span><span style="">fundamental concept
in the or­ganization of every <span class="SpellE">jural</span> society." (</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Ponce</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>, 91

<p class="BODY">The second proposition needs no elaborate discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful perusal of the allegations of facts
constituting <span style="">the cause </span>of action
in the third party complaint reveals that they are but <span style="">reiterations of the allegations in the </span>amended complaint and the
complaint in intervention in Civil Case No. 34498, and of the special defenses
pleaded by Pedro Bermudez, <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> Bermudez and <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin in the present case, that is, that through
deceit, fraud, and <span style="">misrepresentation
practiced on Domino Martin by the Andra­</span>de spouses, they (herein
appellants) lost their lands. But as the issue of <span style="">ownership </span>of the land, as <span style="">earlier
stated, </span>has been <span style="">adversely resolved </span>by the trial court in Civil Case No. <span style="">34498, </span>against herein defendants Pedro
Bermudez and <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> <span style="">Bermudez, and their mother <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Martin,
the trial court was then right when it said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

civil case No. 34498 en­</span><span style="">titled,
Pedro </span><span style="">Bermudez and <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> </span><span style="">Bermudez
vs. Joaquin Andrade et al., which decision has already become final, the admission
of the third party complaint is hereby denied."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For, indeed, the
admission of </span>the third party com­plaint would be superfluous under the

by the <span style="">trial </span>court in <span style="">Civil </span>Case No. <span style="">34498.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We <span style="">hold, therefore, that the trial court did not
