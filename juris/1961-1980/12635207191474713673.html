<p class="BODY">The cause for ill-feeling that existed between the <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> brothers and the intended victim, Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>, a close relative, <span style="">was </span>narrated in the appealed decision thus: "Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> on one hand and <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>, Angelino <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and
the wives of <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span>

cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And all of them are residents
of Mercedes, <span class="SpellE">Mahanob</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Baganga</span></span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Pudpuds</span> used to
be in cordial relation until the former filed with this Court, Branch III, in
1956, <span style="">a </span>complaint for recovery
of possession of a parcel of land situated at Mercedes, <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and damages against the <span class="SpellE">Pudpuds</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment by default was rendered against
the defendants, but the same was subsequently amended in that a decision based
upon an amicable settlement was entered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'As a gesture of charity, <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> bound
himself to pay the <span class="SpellE">Pudpuds</span> the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as 'additional payment for the land in litigation
containing 2 hectares which defendant agree to vacate and deliver to the

to the <span class="SpellE">Pudpuds</span> and they [were on good terms]
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after they had spent the

What happened on that tragic day of March 27, 1964, before the actual killing,
was likewise set forth in such decision in these words: "On March 27,
1964, Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> went to the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, which is
about four kilometers from Mercedes, to file a criminal case of grave threat
against <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>
committed on March 26, 1964, and another criminal action of arson against <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> also and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span>, likewise
committed on March 26, 1964, in which the house of his mother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> was
burned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of grave threat
[resulting from] <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>
[threatening] 'to kill Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> as soon as
he has a chance to do so' was decided by the Court, Branch II, on March 8,
1966, convicting the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case
of arson was tried by this branch of the Court on April 18 and the decision
will be promulgated in the 21st of this month of May.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> took along
with him to <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span> that day of <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Langoay</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> in order to testify in said
cases."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After noting that on the same afternoon the accused appellant <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span> inquired from
the mother-in-law of Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> whether he
would be returning to Mercedes from <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span> that
evening, the lower court continued its narration of facts thus: "As stated
above, <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>
on March 27, 1964, with <span class="SpellE">Langoay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>, to file the grave threats and arson
cases, but only the grave threat case was received or entertained by the chief
of police that day, for he <span style="">was </span>very
busy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left for <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>
[riding] on <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, because the passenger jeeps
plying between Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span> were not
available that day as it was <span class="GramE">good</span> Friday and returned
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time> after they had
attended the good Friday celebration, passing through the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>-trail
as they did in coming. <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> were riding on one <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
astride, * * * with <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> in front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Langoay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> were following very closely on another <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>,* * *. It was a moonlight night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a place in the trail about 30 meters away
from the house of Angelino <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and 50 meters away
from the house of <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>,
de <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>, <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> and his
companions ‘heard the creaking of the cogon grasses and [they] looked back our
way and immediately [they] heard shotgun fire.’" The sound came from the
right side of the road and about three meters away from the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
on which <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>
were riding. The gunshot also came from the same side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the gunshot or explosion,
the eyes of <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> were 'somewhat covered with
smoke and [he] could notice that [his] companion [<span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>]
was fatally hit because he immediately fell down and [so did he.]' Both fell
down at the same time. Immediately after, <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Langoay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>, armed with a
shotgun and a bolo, and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span>,
Angelino <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and Pastor <span class="SpellE">Cereligia</span>,
all armed with bolos, come out of the cogon grasses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> went to where <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>
was, who was lying on the ground, face down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon noticing that it <span style="">was </span><span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> said: 'He is not the one hit,' then proceeded to
where <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> was and struck him with a bolo but <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> jumped and ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span> chased him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As they were chasing <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> said: 'Do not
run, I will finish you, <span class="SpellE"><u>putang</u></span> <u>Ina</u> <span class="GramE"><u>mo</u>.' <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On</span> the
other hand, Angelino <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and Pastor <span class="SpellE">Cereligia</span> approached <span class="SpellE">Langoay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> and so the latter two also ran away. <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> ran as fast as he could through the thick bushes
where he hid until those chasing him had lost him and had left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he went home, passing through thick
bushes and the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mahanob</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was
</span>about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> that
evening when he reached home and <span style="">saw </span><span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, who had related to his family what had happened to
them."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> died on the spot, having been hit <span style="">at </span>the right eyebrow, part of his head
being blown off, with fragments of his brain found scattered near his body.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their brief, appellants did not dispute the above recital
concerning the actual killing of <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> and the
wounding of Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would cast doubt, however, on the
existence of the motive of the accused for wishing harm on Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> and would not concede that they made threats
against his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stress was laid in
their brief on <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>,
not the appellants, being the sole culprit, as there was no conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the last paragraph of their narration
of facts reads: "Moments after the shot the four accused emerged from the
cogon bushes. <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>
<span style="">was </span>carrying a home­made shotgun
in his left hand a bolo in the right hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other three accused <span class="GramE">who</span> followed <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> <span style="">were also </span>armed each with a bolo. * *
*Walking ahead of his party, <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> approached the body of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>
and then went to where Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> was lying on
the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made a slash at <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> with his bolo but the latter <span style="">was </span>not hit as he <span style="">was </span>able to get up immediately and run
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cubelo</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
gave chase to <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> but the latter was able to run
and elude his pursuers. * * * In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Dominico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> <span class="SpellE">Langoay</span> saw Angelino <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> and
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Cereligia</span>, approaching them, whereupon they
jumped from their <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and ran away, heading
towards the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>.
* * <span class="GramE">*<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus</span>
ended the unfortunate incident that befell the four travelers on that night of <st1:date year="1964" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1964</st1:date> on the road to
Mercedes."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the above facts, the lower court rendered its decision of May
21, 1966 finding the appellants as well as the accused <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
murder of Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> and sentencing them to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> as well <span style="">as </span>to the penalty of indemnifying the heirs of the deceased
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> in the amount of P6,000.00, and
likewise guilty of the crime of attempted homicide against the person of
Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>, for which they would be made to
suffer one year of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal <span style="">was </span>taken to this Court but, as noted at the outset, <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> had withdrawn his
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the brief for
defendants-appellants filed on September 30, 1967, they would <span style="">assail </span>the appealed decision on the
sole ground that error was committed by the lower court in its finding of
conspiracy, the only other error being a corollary of the above contention that
appellants should not therefore have been convicted as only <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> should be held liable for the offenses in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be lost sight of
that in the lower court, the defense of alibi was interposed, but evidently,
appellants realized how weak and insub­stantial was such a claim, thus
prompting them to rely on the alleged absence of <span style="">a </span>conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, as
was made clear at the opening of this opinion, such is not the case at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reversal is not indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conspiracy in the
statutory language "exists when two or more persons come to an agreement
concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The objective then on the part of the conspirators is to perform an act or
omission punishable by law. What is required is assent to the perpetration of
such a misdeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That must be their
intent. There is need in the language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>
in the early lead­ing case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Magcomot</span>, a 1909 decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
for “concurrence of wills" or "unity of action and purpose".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The usual phraseology employed in many <span style="">of
the later cases is "common and joint purpose and design."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> At times, reference is made to
"previous concert of criminal design."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Its manifestation could be shown by
"united and concerted action."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">conspiracy need not be
proved by direct evidence; it may be deduced from the mode and manner in which
the offense was perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conditions attending its commission and the acts executed may be indicative of
a common design to accomplish a criminal purpose and objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, to use the apt words of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, there is "a chain of circumstances" to </span>that
effect, then conspiracy has been established.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> If </span>such be the case then, the act of <span style="">one is </span>the act of <span style="">all </span>the others involved and each is to
be held to the <span style="">same degree </span>of
liability as the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been
our constant ruling from the 1905 decision of <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">Maza</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2. Tested by the above controlling legal doctrines, the lower
court decision, to repeat, cannot be overturned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The effort of appellants in their brief to
demonstrate that there was no conspiracy is doomed to futility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not deny because they could not deny
that <span style="">a </span>land dispute existed
among the appellants and <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>
on the one hand and their near relation, a first-degree cousin of two of them
and cousin-in-law of the two others, Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>,
dating back to a suit filed against the <span class="SpellE">Pudpuds</span> for
squatting on such property when their uncle, the father of Federico, had
acquired the same as far back as 1935.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that thereafter the suit was settled amicably with the <span class="SpellE">Pudpuds</span> still getting an additional amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, but later, as noted in the decision, there was
evidence that dissatisfaction once more rankled in their breast and a feeling
of resentment at what they must have considered to be an unfair advantage taken
by <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> would not die down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, there was competent and credible
testimony of threats being made against <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mention was likewise made therein that <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> was found guilty
of the offense of grave threats and that on or about the time the decision in
this case was rendered, another one was expected from another <span class="SpellE">sala</span> regarding the case of arson filed not only against him
but against appellant <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the face of such incontrovertible
testimony, it thus clearly appears that a denial that no ill-feeling existed
between the parties involved is absolutely bereft of credence.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The brief for appellants would likewise try to make light of the
presence of all of them with <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> at the place and at the time of the commission of
the criminal acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the
prosecution clearly showed that they were there for one purpose alone, namely,
to waylay their intended victim, Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made certain first that he was going to
return in the early evening of that day from the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
where he filed the action for grave threats. All four of them were together
behind a clump of cogon grasses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, as admitted in their brief, the three appellants were
each armed with a bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What better
proof can there be that <span style="">all </span>of
the accused were just waiting for the opportunity to ambush the unsuspecting
Federico <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they saw him riding astride a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
with the unfortunate Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> behind him, <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>, <span style="">as was </span>intended, he having the

Fortunately for <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> and unfortunately for <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>, it was the latter who was hit near the right
eyebrow; death as a result was instantaneous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a further proof of the persistence in giving bent to their hatred of <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> when they found out that he escaped unharmed, <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> slashed at him
with his bolo and with appellant <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cubelo</span>, chased him after he ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the other appellants
approached menacingly the two other companions of <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could there be any doubt then that all the
accused, including the three appellants, did plan to take the life of <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>? To assert that there was no conspiracy is to
close one's eyes to the undeniable <span style="">facts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Decision, Annex A, Brief for the Defendants-Appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with the above information, it
was noted by the lower court: "The caption of the information shows that
the criminal action is for the complex crime of murder with attempted murder,
whereas the <span class="GramE">designation in the body are</span>, and the alle­gations
therein constitute murder and attempted murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And so it is that there is a variance between the designation appearing
in the caption and the facts alleged in the information as constituting the
offenses and in such a case, the crimes charged in the body-murder and
attempted murder-prevail." <span class="GramE"><i>Ibid</i>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worth noting that no motion to quash
for duplicity of offenses <span style="">was </span>filed
by any of the accused. As shown in the appealed decision, the information was
not as accurate as it could have been.</p>

</span><span class="SpellE">Ampad</span>, L-23513, Jan. 31, 1969, 26 SCRA 750,
where this Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, held
that where, from the prosecution's own evidence, the conspi­racy was against a
certain individual alone, but in the course of the commission of the offense,
another person was likewise shot, the liability for the acts done outside the
scope of the plan agreed upon should fall on the actual perpetrator alone, this
doctrine finds no application as it was shown that the shot made by <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span> was precisely in
pursuance of the conspiracy and that the intended victim was <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> as agreed upon, but it turned out that the person
behind him, <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>, was the one hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, under such circumstances, the
criminal act was part and parcel of the conspiracy agreed upon and all the
conspirators should be held liable.</p>
