<p class="BODY">Respondent Villanueva sought to have the sale registered and
title issued in her favor, free of any encumbrance, but petitioners <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> and <span class="SpellE">Berthelsen</span> objected
alleging that they had registered adverse claims and attachments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Register of Deeds refused to issue a new
title to Villanueva without carrying over (A) the two annotations registered <u>prior</u>
to Villanueva's adverse claim, namely, the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> (Entry No. 7115) made on September 7,
1964 referring to a pending Civil Case No. 2489-P in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> entitled <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span>
R. de Guzman vs. Z. Garcia Realty, Inc.; and the adverse claim (Entry No.
55205) of J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> registered on April 28,
1966 according to the deed of assignment in his favor executed by one Leticia
P. Ramos; and (B) the attachments covering the entire property annotated on the
title subsequent to Villanueva's adverse claim, namely, the <span class="SpellE">Berthelsen</span>
attachment on July 19, 1966 (Entry No. 62224), the <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>
attachment on July 25, 1966 (Entry No. 62748), and the attachment issued in
connection with Civil Case No. 2489-P of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on November 18, 1966 (Entry No. 73465).</p>

<p class="BODY">The position taken by the Register of Deeds was predicated on the
following reasons:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A registered adverse claim is only a claim,
and not a lien or encumbrance on the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the superior rights of a <span class="SpellE">lienholder</span>
established by law cannot be involved in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The case would have been otherwise, if the agreement itself
were the one registered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the annotations of the said attachments
on Transfer Certificate of Title No. 108425, it appears clearly that the whole
property known as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1-E-2, described therein is being
attached; therefore, it is no longer necessary to make any distinction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the request of respondent Villanueva, the Register of Deeds
elevated the matter <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span> to the
Land Registration Commission, which, on October 20, 1967, issued its
Resolution, the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of which is worded
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Commission holds that the deed
of sale may be registered; Transfer Certificate of Title No. 108425 may be
partially cancelled; and a new transfer certificate of title covering <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
16 of subdivision plan (LRC) Psd-56800 may be issued to Maria Villanueva free
of any encumbrance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In so disposing of the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>consulta</u></span>, <span style="">the
Commission opined:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A registered notice of adverse claim takes priority over all subsequent
encumbrances and becomes subject only to all annotations registered prior to
it, except legal liens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the notice
of adverse claim of Maria Villanueva appears to be subject to the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>filed
in connection with Civil Case No. 2489-P of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and to the notice of adverse claim of J. Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>, both having been registered ahead, yet, as said
notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>and adverse claim refer to specific
lots other than Lot 6, Block 4, sold to Maria Villanueva, her notice of adverse
claim becomes free of any encumbrances, much less of the attachments subsequently
annotated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied, they
interposed this appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, with the following Assignments of
Error:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 10pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>"THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONER ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT
THAT RESPONDENT MARIA VILLANUEVA'S ADVERSE CLAIM HAS FOR ITS BASIS AN
UNREGISTERED 'AGREEMENT TO SELL.' SAID ADVERSE CLAIM, THEREFORE, HAS NO FORCE
AND EFFECT AND, HENCE, A NULLITY AS FAR AS PETITIONERS ARE CONCERNED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 10pt 0in;">"II</p>

<blockquote>"THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONER ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT

TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE NO. 108425).</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 10pt 0in;">"III</p>

<blockquote>"THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONER ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT
THAT RESPONDENT, MARIA VILLANUEVA, FAILED TO EXHAUST THE REMEDY OF REGISTERING
THE 'AGREEMENT TO SELL' SHE EXECUTED WITH Z. GARCIA REALTY, INC."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners take the position that:</p>

<blockquote>"The registered adverse claim or lien of J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> under Entry No. 55209 involving Lot 5 of Block 5 of
the <span class="SpellE">Garville</span> Subdivision, according to the deed of
assignment executed by Leticia Ramos is prior to and superior to that of
petitioner Maria Villanueva (herein respondent).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the lien annotated in favor of <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> holds preference over that of Maria Villanueva.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The agreement to <span style="">sell
</span>in favor of Maria Villanueva was not registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the rights of a <span class="SpellE">lienholder</span>
established by law cannot be invoked in favor of petitioner (herein
respondent)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent Villanueva contends that her
adverse claim is valid; that it conforms with the requirements of Section 110
of Act 496, and until found to be frivolous, vexatious or unmeritorious by a
Court of competent jurisdiction, it is an interest or lien protected by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, a registered adverse
claim is a lien or encumbrance on the property, specifically on the particular
portion which it covers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
Section 110 of Act 496 does not require registration as the basis of the
adverse claim, referring to the agreement to sell in this case, it being
sufficient that a statement be made setting forth the basis of the claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that between two involuntary documents, the earlier
entry prevails.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Ordinarily, therefore, the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>entered on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1964</st1:date>, and <span class="SpellE">Leviste's</span>
adverse claim annotated on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="4">April 28,
 1966</st1:date>, both registered prior to respondent Villanueva's adverse
claim, which was entered on <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1966</st1:date>,
are entitled to precedence over the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, inasmuch as the aforesaid <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendens</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>refers to <u><span style="">Lot 3</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(<span class="SpellE">redesignated</span>
as <u><span style="">Lot 5</span></u><span style="">) </span>and <span class="SpellE">Leviste's</span>
adverse claim to <u><span style="">Lot 1</span></u><span style="">, <u>Block 5</u>, </span>notwithstanding
their prior registration, they cannot affect Villanueva's adverse claim over <u><span style="">Lot 6</span></u><span style="">, <u>Block 4</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
aforesaid inscriptions, therefore, need not be carried over to the new title to
be issued in Villanueva's favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question to resolve is the priority between Villanueva's
adverse claim and the attachments of <span class="SpellE">Berthelsen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>, and that in Civil Case No. 2489-P of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, all registered <u><span style="">subsequent</span></u><span style=""> </span>to Villanueva's adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The answer would depend on whether Villanueva's adverse claim is, in
fact, <span class="SpellE">registerable</span>, and if so, whether it can be
preferred over the attachments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 110 of Act 496 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Whoever claims any right or interest in registered land adverse
to the registered owner, arising subsequent to the date of the original
registration, may, if no other provision is made in the Land Registration Act
for registering the same, make a statement in writing setting forth fully his
alleged right or interest, and how or under whom acquired, and a reference to
the volume and page of the certificate of title of the registered owner, and a
description of the land in which the right or interest is claimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement shall be signed and sworn to,
and shall state the adverse claimant's residence, and designate a place at
which all notices may be served upon him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This statement shall be entitled to registration as an adverse claim,
and the court, upon a petition of any party in interest, shall grant a speedy
hearing upon the question of the validity of such adverse claim and shall enter
such decree therein as justice and equity may require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the claim is adjudged to be invalid, the
registration shall be cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If in
any case the court after notice and hearing finds that a claim thus registered
was frivolous or vexatious, it may tax the adverse claimant double or treble
costs in its discretion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The basis of respondent Villanueva's adverse claim was an
agreement to sell executed in her favor by Garcia Realty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An agreement to sell is a voluntary
instrument as it is a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> act of the registered
owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such voluntary instrument,
Section 50 of Act No. 496 expressly provides that the act of registration shall
be the operative act to convey and affect the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Section 55 of the same Act requires the
presentation of the owner's duplicate certificate of title for the registration
of any deed or voluntary instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
the agreement to sell involves an interest less than an estate in fee simple,
the same should have been registered by filing it with the Register of Deeds
who, in turn, makes a brief memorandum there upon the original and owner's
duplicate certificate of title.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for requiring the production of the owner's duplicate certificate in
the registration of a voluntary instrument is that, being a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
act of the registered owner, it is to be presumed that he is interested in
registering the instrument and would willingly surrender, present or produce
his duplicate certificate of title to the Register of Deeds in order to
accomplish such registration.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, where the owner refuses to surrender the duplicate certificate for the
annotation of the voluntary instrument, the grantee may file with the Register
of Deeds a statement setting forth his adverse claim, as provided for in
Section 110 of Act No. 496.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In such a case, the annotation of the instrument upon the entry book is
sufficient to affect the real estate to which it relates, although Section 72
of Act No. 496 imposes upon the Register of Deeds the duty to require the
production by the registered owner of his duplicate certificate for the
inscription of the adverse claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The annotation of an adverse claim is a measure designed to protect the
interest of a person over a piece of real property where the registration of
such interest or right is not otherwise provided for by the Land Registration
Act, and serves as a notice and warning to third parties dealing with said
property that someone is claiming an interest on the same or a better right
than the registered owner thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City vs.
<span class="SpellE">Nicandro</span> (1 SCRA 1334 [1961]), it was held that for
the special remedy of adverse claim to be availed of, it must be shown that
there is no other provision in the law for registration of the claimant's
alleged right or interest in the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In said case, the basis of the adverse claim was a perfected contract of
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Land Registration Act
specifically prescribes the procedure for registration of the vendee's right on
a registered property (Section 57), the filing of an adverse claim was held
ineffective <span style="">for </span>the purpose of
protecting the vendee's right.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it does not appear that Villanueva attempted
to register the agreement to sell under Section 52 of <span style="">Act </span>No. 496 and that the registered owner, Garcia Realty,
refused to surrender the duplicate certificate for the annotation of said
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Villanueva merely
filed an adverse claim based on said agreement to sell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that Section 52 of the Land
Registration Act prescribes <span style="">the </span>procedure
for the registration of Villanueva's interest less than an estate in fee simple
on the disputed lot and there being no showing of her inability to produce the
owner's duplicate certificate, the remedy provided in Section 110 of Act 496,
which was resorted to by Villanueva, is, therefore, ineffective for the purpose
of protecting her right or interest on the disputed lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the adverse claim filed by Villanueva was not valid,
the same did not have the effect of a conveyance of her right or interest on
the disputed lot and could not prejudice any right that may have arisen
thereafter in favor of third parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the attachments of <span class="SpellE">Berthelsen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>, and that in Civil Case No. 2489-P of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> covering the disputed lot are
