of First Instance of Manila in its Case No. 33407.
    

    
  Appellees Kua Suy  and her three  minor sons, all of
    
Chinese nationality,  had  sued  the appellant Commissioner
    
of  Immigration to have  him enjoined from  expelling appellees  as  overstaying  visitors,  and  confiscating  their
    
P34,000 cash  bond.
    

    
  The case was submitted upon the following  stipulated
    
facts:<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. That petitioners, who are respectively the wife
and minor children of Liu Giok In, a Chinese and permanent resident
merchant in the Philippines, were admitted as temporary visitors in the
country on June 17, 1955 with an authorized stay of 3 months only.</p>
  <p>"2. That  on August 4, 1955, that is before the expiration of
          
their  original authorized period  of  temporary stay  in this country
          
petitioners, through their counsel, requested the Secretary of Foreign
          
Affairs fcr permission to  remain in this country  for a period not
          
exceeding  the  pendency of  the  naturalization proceedings  of Liu
          
Giok  In,  husband/father,  of the  petitioners  which request  was
          
granted  by  the Secretary of Foreign  Affairs  and  notice thereof
          
was sent to the respondent by way of 1st indorsement dated August
          
15, 1955, subject  to  the following  conditions:</p>
  <p>'(a) That  subject  aliens  will have  their  reentry   permits to
            
Hongkong kept valid during their  temporary stay in this country
            
or  until  the determination  of  the  naturalization  proceedings of
            
aforesaid husband  father.</p>
  <p>'(b) That non-immigrant  statute  and  cash  bond  as prescribed
              
by the resolution of the cabinet on March 19, 1954 are mentioned.</p>
  <p>'(c) That  the  said minor sons  of Liu Giok  In  are actually
                
enrolled  in any of the public or government recognized government
                
public school  during the  <i>entire</i>  period of their  temporary  stay
                
in  this  country.</p>
  <p>'(<i>d</i>)
That the proceedings for the naturalization of the alien husband/father
shall be pursued in good faith and without unnecessary delay and should
it fail to prosper their permits shall be deemed cancelled and they
shall immediately voluntarily leave the country.'</p>
  <p> " '3. That the petitioners have complied with the
conditions imposed by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs relative to the
extension of their temporary stay in this country.</p>
  <p>" '4. That on June  24, 1957,  the  respondent called  attention of
                      
 the Secretary of  Foreign Affairs  to the fact that the petitioners
                      
 who  are staying  in  this country by virtue of the extension of their
                      
 stay  as  mentioned above, have  been  staying in this country beyond
                      
 the  period  that  which  is  allowed by  the Immigration Law  and
                      
 asked whether petitioners  should  be allowed to stay  further.</p>
  <p>"
'5. That on August 2, 1957 the Acting Secretary of Foreign Affairs
informed the respondent that the said department is unable to authorize
the further extension of petitioners herein and suggested to respondent
that petitioners be required to leave the Philippines immediately.</p>
  <p>" '6. That in line with the
aforesaid directive from the Department of Foreign Affairs, respondent
requested the petitioners to leave the Philippines voluntarily within 3
days from receipt, otherwise drastic action for their forcible removal
may be taken by his Office and the cash bond posted in their behalf
declared forfeited.</p>
  <p>
" '7. That as a result of the abovementioned letter of the respondent,
petitioners filed the present petition. This Honorable Court granted a
writ of preliminary injunction upon the filing of the petition of the
surety bond in the amount of P5,000.00 restraining the respondent from
causing the forcible removal of petitioners from the country and
confiscating the cash bond of P34,000.00 deposited by Liu Giok In until
further orders from the Court.</p>
  <p>" '8. That  on August 17,  1957, the Court  of First Instance of
                              
Leyte in  Case No. 40, rendered a decision  granting Liu Giok  In's
                              
petition  for naturalization,  which decision became  final without an
                              
appeal  taken therefrom by the government.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 28 March 1958, the Court of First Instance of Manila
                            
rendered judgment granting a writ of injunction as prayed
                            
for on  the ground that  the decision of  the Court of First
                            
Instance of Leyte, in its  Civil Case No. 40,  granting naturalization to Liu Giok In, Kua Suy's husband (and father
                            
of the  other petitioners-appellees), and dated  17 August
                            
1957, having become final, the Immigration Commissioner's
                            
order for  appellees  to leave the Islands within  three days
                            
from notice had "become untenable", and any implementation of said order "is evidently in excess of his power  and
                            
jurisdiction and inconsistent  with the  provisions" of the
                            
naturalization law.</p>
<p>From this decision the Commissioner has duly appealed.</p>
<p>The decision must be reversed.</p>
<p> In the first place, the finality of the 1957 decision declaring the
husband of Kua Suy to be qualified for naturalization does not
automatically make him a Filipino citizen, since the law prescribes a
further probationary period of two years before he can take an oath of
allegiance. Until then, and only upon proof that he complied with the
statutory requirements, the applicant does not become naturalized as a
citizen; much less would citizenship be extended to his wife and
children, appellee herein. Therefore, the latter remained aliens at the
time the appealed decision was rendered, and since there is no question
that they had exhausted, the maximum period alloted them as temporary:
visitors, it was the appellant Commissioner's right, nay, his duty, to
expel appellees.</p>
<p>Appellees invoke the benefits of an alleged Cabinet resolution of 29
February 1956 that authorized the extension of the period of stay of
aliens Tan Ban and Go Siok Yan. But paragraph 5 of the stipulation of
facts clearly shows that in the case of present appellees, the
extension granted by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs was definitely
terminated on 2 August 1957, and the Immigration Commissioner was then
set free to proceed with the appellees' expulsion. Only the injunction
issued by the trial court stopped the Commissioner from doing so.</p>
<p>It is also argued that the Secretary of Justice (who is the
administrative superior of the Commissioner of Immigration), by Opinion
(No. 287, dated 3 December 1958, extended appellees' stay until the
expiration of the husband's two-year probationary period. It appears,
however, that the same Secretary revoked the opinion referred to, on 5
February 1959, because his prior opinion was obtained without full
disclosure of facts and circumstances.</p>
<p>That the husband Liu Giok In should have finally taken
                                      
his oath of allegiance in 1959,  when this  appeal was already pending, does not improve  the case for appellees.
                                      
Under Section 15 of the Naturalization Act, the wife is
                                      
deemed a  citizen  of the  Philippines only  if she "might
                                      
herself be lawfully naturalized", so that the fact of marriage to a citizen,  by itself alone, does not suffice to confer
                                      
citizenship, as this Court has previously ruled in Ly Giok
                                      

                                      Ka <i>vs</i>. Galang, 101 Phil., 459; 54 Off. Gaz., 356; and in Cua
                                      
                                      <i>vs</i>. Board  of Immigration Commissioners,  101  Phil., 521;
                                      
53 Off. Gaz., 8567; and there is here no evidence of record
                                      
as to  the  qualifications or  absence of disqualifications  of
                                      
appellee Kua  Suy.  As to the minor children, it  is  to be observed that the same section (paragraph 3) of the
                                      
naturalization law  extends citizenship to &amp; foreign-born
                                      
minor child "if dwelling in the Philippines at  the time of
                                      
the naturalization of the parent", and, of course, "dwelling"
                                      
must necessarily be construed to mean  "lawful residence".
                                      
Since prior to  the time the father of these appellees took
                                      
his oath of allegiance  (on 24  August 1959), the lawful
                                      
period of stay of these children  had  already expired in
                                      
1957,  and they had  been already required to leave the
                                      
Islands, plainly they were no longer lawfully residing therein and have no right to be considered as also naturalized.
                                      
The naturalization Act was certainly not intended to be an
                                      
excuse for violations of our immigration laws.</p>
<p>This case, and many others of the same nature that this
                                        
Court has had to decide, are strong evidence of a tendency
                                        
on the part of certain aliens to enter on temporary visitors'
                                        
permits and thereafter rely on the improvident  issuance
                                        
of injunctions in immigration cases by the Courts of First
                                        
Instance; for even if the error is subsequently corrected on
                                        
appeal, such aliens are meanwhile able to unduly prolong
                                        
their illegal stay, in violation of our country's immigration
                                        
laws  and policies.  We can not, therefore, overemphasize
                                        
the need of extreme caution in issuing such  injunctions.
                                        
Aliens who voluntarily enter  under temporary permits
                                        
must be strictly required to abide by the periods  fixed
                                        
therein,  because  laxity  in  this matter would merely encourage  entry  under false pretenses.</p>
<p>The appellees' plain remedy is to first leave  the country
                                          
as they promised, and thereafter secure permission to
                                          
reenter permanently.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from  is  reversed, and the writ
                                            
of injunction heretofore issued is hereby revoked and set
                                            
aside. Costs against appellees.</p>

<p>The facts are stated in the decision.  Based  on those
                                                
facts, the  trial court rendered its decision enjoining respondent or whoever acts in his behalf from causing the
                                                
forcible removal of petitioners from the country and confiscating their P34,000 bond until after the expiration of
                                                
the period of two years provided  in Republic  Act  No.

oath of allegiance as  a naturalized citizen.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Immigration appealed.</p>
<p>He claims that the lower  court  erred in  (1) holding
                                                  
that upon the grant of Liu Giok In's petition for naturalization the  issue herein became  moot  since his wife  and
                                                  
children acquired the  right to follow his abode; and  (2)
                                                  
in declaring consequently that appellant acted in  excess
                                                  
of his power in  ordering appellees to leave the Philippines
                                                  
within  3  days  from notice of his order.</p>
<p>During  the pendency of  this  appeal, Liu  Giok In took
                                                    
his oath as a Philippine citizen.   As of that time his oldest
                                                    
son Liu Kang was already of age, but the  other two were
                                                    
still minors, Liu Yack Hua having bom on September 7,
                                                    
1942,  and Liu Su Lim on  August  16, 1944.
                                                    
   The issue is whether or not a Chinese alien's wife and
                                                    
minor children who entered the Philippines  as temporary
                                                    
visitors may be deported after said Chinese alien  has become naturalized as a Philippine citizen.</p>
<p>The  Immigration Act  of 1940, as amended,  provides: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"An alien who  is admitted as a  non-immigrant  cannot remain
                                                          
 in the Philippines permanently.  To  obtain permanent admission, a
                                                          
 nonimmigrant alien must depart voluntarily to some foreign country
                                                          
 and procure from the  appropriate  Philippine  Consul  the proper
                                                          
 visa and  thereafter undergo examination by the  officers of the
                                                          
 Bureau of Immigration  at a Philippine port of entry for determination of his admissibility in accordance with the requirements
                                                          
 of this  Act." (last par., Section 9).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>            Kua Suy alias Kwan Say Dee has  not, by  the fact of
                                                      
          her husband's naturalization, become a Philippine citizen.
                                                      
           This Court  has had occasion  to lay down the rule that
                                                      
 "marriage to a  male Filipino does  not vest Philippine
                                                      
 citizenship to his foreign  wife, unless  she 'herself may be
                                                      
I         lawfully naturalized.' "  (Ly Giok Ha alias Wy  Giok Ha
                                                      
 1<i> vs</i>. Galang, 101 Phil., 459; 54 Off. Gaz., 356; Cua<i> vs</i>. Board
                                                      
          of Immigration Commissioners, 101 Phil., 521; 53 Off. Gaz.,
                                                      
 C        8567; Lee Suan Ay<i> vs</i>.
Galang, 106 Phil., 706). A distinction may be noted between the present
case and the cited cases. Whereas in the former the husband was an
alien who subsequently became naturalized, in the latter, the alien
woman were single when they came to the Philippines as temporary
visitors, and while here married Filipino citizens. Nevertheless, since
the basis for the rule (enunciated in the three cases) is Section 15 of
the Revised Naturalization Law, which states that "any woman who is now
or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the Philippines and who
might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the
Philippines," the same applies with equal force to appellee Kua Suy.
She cannot allege she is a Philippine citizen because she has not

law's clear mandate.  But we have here a case, not of<em> alien temporary visitors</em> seeking to become  <em>alien permanent

by law deemed <em>Filipino</em>  <em>citizens</em>.   The  change  is not in
                                                          
 the character  of  an  alien's  stay  in this country,  that is,
                                                          
from temporary to permanent, without  changing the fact
                                                          
 of his  being an alien, but in his status  from that of alien
                                                          
 to citizen.   The first situation concerns an alien who is
                                                          
 requesting our hospitality, which  request we may deny by
                                                          
 excluding him from admission; the  latter involves  an
                                                          
 alien who has become a  citizen and seeks to exercise  his
                                                          
 rights  as  such, which rights may  not be  curtailed.   If
                                                          
 the law not only allows but  indeed confers a change  in
                                                          
 the citizenship status of the minors in  question.  I  see
                                                          
 no  reason why a change of  lesser magnitude regarding
                                                          
 their right of  residence should not be countenanced.</p>
<p>The question may be asked: Suppose the petitioning minors, before
they may acquire permanent residence, are first ordered to leave the
country, should they do so as Philippine citizens or as aliens? They
must be either one or the other. If they are Philippine citizens (which
no doubt they are at least during their minority, for otherwise the
aforequoted Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law would be
meaningless), then they may not be subject to deportation.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup> On
the other hand, to consider them as aliens would be to ignore the
explicit provision of the Revised Naturalization Law. Or should they be
deemed citizens under the said law and at the same time aliens under
the Immigration Act? The suggestion, on its face, is unthinkable. It is
contrary to the intendment of Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization
Law, particularly that portion which refers to foreign-born minor
children who, at the time of the naturalization of their father, is
outside the Philippines. They are deemed Philippine citizens only
during their minority, unless they begin to reside permanently here
when still minors in which case they will continue to be citizens even
after becoming of age. Implicit in this provision is the right of these
minors to establish a permanent residence in this country in order that
they may not lose their citizenship status conferred by law, which loss
would inevitably result if during minority they are deported and thus
prevented from complying with the requisite of the law as to the
establishment of a permanent residence. </p>
<p>The purpose of Section 9, last paragraph, of the Immigration  Act is to prevent an alien from converting his
                                                            
temporary visit into a permanent stay without prior determination of his desirability as Philippine  resident.  Since
                                                            
the right  of the petitioning minors to be admitted into
                                                            
the country cannot be seriously questioned, by reason of
                                                            
their Philippine citizenship, it  would be unreasonable and
                                                            
impractical to require them to go through the  rigmarole
                                                            
of first leaving the country before their admission as permanent residents at least during  their minority.  Whether
                                                            
or not, after becoming of age,  they  will continue to  be
                                                            
citizens  will of course depend upon the  fact of the permanence of their  residence here within the  meaning of

<sup><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font></sup> The phrase, "shall be
deemed a citizen", Section 1994, Revised Statute (U.S. Comp. Stat. 1901
1268) or as it was in the Act of 1855 (10 Sta. at L-604, Chapt. 71,
Sec. 2), "shall be deemed and taken to be a citizen", while it may imply
that the person to whom it relates has not actually become a citizen by
the ordinary means or in the usual way, as by the judgment of a
competent court, upon a proper application and proof, yet does not
follow that such a person is not on that account practically any the
less a citizen. The word "deemed" is the equivalent of "considered" or
"adjudged", and therefore, whatever an act of Congress requires to be
"deemed" or "taken as true" of any person or thing must, in law, be
considered as having been duly adjudged or established concerning such
person or thing, and have the force and effect accordingly. When,
therefore, Congress declares that alien woman shall, under certain
circumstances, be "deemed" an American citizen, the effect when the
contigency occurs, is equivalent to her being naturalized directly by
an act of Congress or in the usual mode thereby prescribed. Velayo's
Philippine Citizenship and Naturalization, p. 127, citing Van Dyne, Op.
Cit., pp.239-240.
<p><sup><font color="#ff0000">[2]</font></sup> There is no question
that as the power to deport is limited to aliens only, the alienage of
the respondent in deportation proceedings is a basic and fundamental
fact upon which the jurisdiction of the Deportation Board depends. If
the alienage of the respondent is not denied, the Board's jurisdiction
and its proceedings are unassailable; if the respondent is admittedly a
citizen, or conclusively shown to be such, the Board lacks jurisdiction
and its proceedings are null and void <i>ab initio</i> and may be
summarily enjoined in the courts. Naturally, the Board must have the
power, in the first instance, to determine the respondent's
nationality. And the respondent must present evidence of his claim of
citizenship before the courts alone in a subsequent action of habeas
corpus. (Armona <i>vs</i>. Aldanese, 54 Phil., 696). It must quash the
proceedings if it is satisfied that respondent is a citizen, and
continue it if finds that he is not, even if the respondent claims
citizenship and denied alienage. Its jurisdiction is not divested by
the mere claim of citizenship. (Miranda, et. al., <i>vs</i>. Deportation Board, G.R. No. L-6784, prom. March 12, 1954.)</p>
<p>There is also no question that respondent who claims to be a citizen
and not therefore subject to deportation has the right to have his
citizenship reviewed by the courts, after the deportation proceedings.
When the evidence submitted by a respondent is conclusive of his
citizenship, the right to immediate review should also be recognized
and the courts should promptly enjoin the deportation proceedings. A
citizen is entitled to live in peace, without molestation from any
official or authority, and if he is disturbed by a deportation
proceeding, he has the unquestionable right to resort to the courts for
his protection, either by a writ of habeas corpus or of prohibition, on
the legal ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction. If he is a citizen
and evidence thereof is satisfactory, there is no sense nor justice in
allowing the deportation proceedings to continue, granting him the
remedy only after the Board has finished its investigation of his
undesirability. The legal basis of the prohibition is the absence of
the jurisdictional fact, alienage. Chua Hiong <i>vs</i>. The Deportation Board, 51 Off. Gaz., p.1837.</p>
