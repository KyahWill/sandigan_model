VS. FELIX SAN JUAN, ET AL., DEFENDANTS-APPELLEES.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> Rural Bank filed this
action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
to set aside a writ of execution is­sued by a branch of that court and to
recover damages allegedly suffered as a result of the issuance of the writ of
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal ground for the
action is that the writ of execution was without the authority of the court to
issue because the bank had earlier taken an appeal, thereby depriving the court
of jurisdiction to act in the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Named as <span class="GramE">defendants</span> were the spouses Felix San
Juan and Manuela <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> in whose favor the judgment
was rendered, Judge <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> S. Santiago of branch V of
the court, the clerk of court in his capacity as ex-<span class="SpellE">oficio</span>
provincial sheriff, and the deputy provincial sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the spouses San Juan, however,
the court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it had no power to annul
the orders and processes of a coor­dinate branch.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that in civil case U-902, branch V of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> rendered judgment
against the <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> Rural Bank, ordering the latter to
vacate a piece of land and the house built thereon, which the bank had leased
from the spouses San Juan, and to pay rental for their use and occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1966</st1:date> the court ordered execution of its judg­ment even before
the time to appeal had expired, upon the filing by the spouses of a bond of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeals, where the
case was docketed as <st1:place><st1:city>C.A.-G.R.</st1:city> <st1:postalcode>39103</st1:postalcode></st1:place>,
and asked that the lower court be ordered to hold in abeyance the execution of
its judgment while the appeal was pending.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
writ of execution lapsed in the meantime without being enforced, the trial
court ordered on <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1967</st1:date>
the issuance of an <u>alias</u> writ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is the order which the bank assails in this action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1968</st1:date>
the defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed a petition to dismiss
the appeal in this case on the ground that the issue ten­dered had become
moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis of the petition is the
resolu­tion dated <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1968</st1:date>
of the Court of Appeals in <st1:place><st1:city>C.A.-G.R.</st1:city> <st1:postalcode>39103</st1:postalcode></st1:place>,
which resolution has become final, dismissing the appeal of the bank in civil
case U-902 for failure to file its brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is well taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the dismissal of the ap­peal taken by the bank, the decision in
civil case U-902 has be­come final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and,
therefore, the power of the trial court to execute its judgment must now be
deemed beyond ques­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank,
however, contends that aside from the validity of the writ of execution its
right to damages is likewise in issue in this case, but the issue of damages is
merely incidental, since <span style="">an </span>award
of damages may follow only after a declaration that the writ of execution is
void.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, this appeal should be dismissed because the brief
for the bank, as appellant in this case, was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief, which should have been filed on or
before <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="2">Feb­ruary 14, 1968</st1:date>,
was actually filed on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1968</st1:date>,
25 days after <span style="">the last </span>day for
filing it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant appeal is dismissed.</p>
