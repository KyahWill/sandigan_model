				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A shipment from <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
<span style="">of ninety </span>seven (97) cartons
yarn of continuous <span style="">acetate </span><span class="SpellE">filamen</span> tow was discharged by the carrier SS "<span class="SpellE">Eurygenes</span>" into <span style="">the
custody of the Bureau of Customs which was </span>then operating the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, only 76 cartons were delivered to the ultimate consignee, the <span style="">Synthetic </span>Textile Manufacturers'
Company Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 21 cartons loss, worth
P11<span class="GramE">,700.04</span> was paid by the Firemen's Insurance Company
as insurer of the cargo against loss or damage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having failed as <span class="SpellE"><span style="">subrogee</span></span><span style=""> </span>to
the consignee to recover from the Bureau of Customs, <span style="">the </span>Firemen's Insurance <span style="">Company
on September 7, 1965 filed </span><span style="">before
</span><span style="">the Court of First Instance of
Manila an action </span>against <span style="">the
Republic of </span>the Philippines, the Bureau of <span style="">Customs and </span>the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service for the recovery of P11<span class="GramE">,700.04</span> with legal <span style="">interest plus P2,500.00 attorney's fees and
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defendants moved </span>to
dismiss the complaint on the <span style="">ground</span><span style=""> that the court had no jurisdiction over </span>the
defendants because the Republic of the Philippines itself may <span style="">not </span>be sued without its consent and
also because the Bureau <span style="">of Customs as
well as the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service, being mere
governmental agencies, do not have juridical personalities to sue or be sued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also alleged was the fact that being a money
claim, the same could have been filed before the Auditor General according to
Act 3083, as amended by Commonwealth Act 327.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Over the objections of the plaintiff, the Court of First Instance
of Manila, finding the motion to be meritorious, dismissed the case.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After denial of its motion for reconsideration, the plaintiff
appealed from the order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is now settled that the Bureau of Customs and the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service are mere agencies of the Republic of the
Philippines thru it performs the prime governmental function of taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A necessary incident to such a function is
the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service which though deemed proprietary
in nature, does not subject the defendants to suit; otherwise, they would be
hampered in the performance of a prime <span class="GramE">governmental</span>
function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
or its aforesaid agencies, therefore, <span class="GramE">are</span> not subject
to suit without its consent, for said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present claim for money
should instead have been filed before the office of the Auditor General in
accordance with the procedure set forth in Act 3083, as amended by Commonwealth
Act 327.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the instant claim is for
a fixed amount based on papers and documents within easy reach of accounting
officers, the same differs from <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span> claims
outside the Auditor General's power to consider (Insurance Company of North
America v. Republic, L-27517, September 15, 1967).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal appealed from is
affirmed, without costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><span style="">SO
</span>ORDERED.</span></p>
