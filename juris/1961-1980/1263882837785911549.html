inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked him what he was doing
there and <span style="">he </span>said he would like
to buy a coke, to which she told him that this was not a store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> went out and

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The only evidence of the
prosecution on the alleged participation of the appellants is the testimony on
cross-examination of the accused Victor <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> that
the brothers Wilson Lim and William Lim broached to said <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span>
the idea of killing <span class="SpellE">Calixtro</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span>
for P3,000.00; that in addition <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> was promised
the hand in marriage of Leticia Lim, the appellants' sister; that <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> actually received only P300.00; and that on July 29,
1970 <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> and the two appellants went inside the <span class="SpellE">Crystallyne</span> theater where <span class="SpellE">Calixtro</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span> was shot by <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The accused Victor <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> is not a credible witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He executed three statements admitting that
he killed <span class="SpellE">Calixtro</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> also executed
three different statements repudiating his three extrajudicial confessions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> that the appellants went inside the <span class="SpellE">Crystallyne</span> Theater on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="7"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">July 29, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> was not corroborated by the evidence of the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one of the witnesses of
the prosecution declared having seen the appellants inside the said theater at
the time <span class="SpellE">Calixtro</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span>
was shot by <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the trial court found that "Among those who were in the

have failed to see the appellants if said appellants were inside the theater.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The appellants were only seen
running together with Victor <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> by Domingo <span class="SpellE">Mallanao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Bautista,
both witnesses for the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is no reason why the
appellants should run away from the scene of the shooting if, according to the
theory of the prosecution, they did not participate in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Calixtro</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the prosecution is that the
appellants are co-principals by inducement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time of the actual shooting no person had reason to suspect the
appellants to have induced the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence there was no need for said appellants to run away immediately
after <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> had shot <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The appellants have adduced
evidence that they were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span> Judge
<span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Mendoza in <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>
at the time that <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span> shot <span class="SpellE">Cauan</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Although alibi is known to be the
weakest of all defenses for it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove,
nevertheless, where the evidence for the prosecution is weak and betrays lack
of concreteness on the question of whether or not the accused committed the
crime charged, the defense of alibi assumes importance.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> an
accused cannot be convicted on the basis of evidence which, independently of
his alibi, is weak, uncorroborated, and inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily
proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases;
otherwise, we will see the absurdity of an accused being put in a more
difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than
where it is strong."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In view of the foregoing, it is
clear that the evidence for the prosecution against the appellants William Lim
and Wilson Lim is weak and unsatisfactory to justify a finding of guilt as
against them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed as to
