Angeles, alias <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, were charged with robbery with
homicide in two separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed in the
Court of First Instance of Manila (Criminal Case No. 72552 where the defendants
were Bautista and Gonzales, and Criminal Case No. 72619 where <span style="">the </span>lone defendant was Angeles).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a joint trial upon a plea of not guilty
entered by all the <span class="GramE">defendants</span>, the court found them
guilty of attempted robbery with homicide and rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court finds the
accused herein, <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> Bautista <span style="">y </span>Base @ <span class="SpellE">Cadio</span>, Armando Gonzales <span style="">y </span>Jose @ Boy <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Angeles Y <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
@ <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of attempted robbery with homicide, as defined and punished under Art. 297 of
the Revised Penal Code, and considering the ag­gravating circumstance of superior
strength, hereby sentences each and all of them to suffer the penalty of </span><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">perpetua</span></u></span><span style="">, with the accessories of the law, to indem­nify
the heirs of the deceased, jointly and severally in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span>, without, however, any further subsidiary imprisonment
in case of insolvency, and to pay the proportionate amount of the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="">SO
ORDERED."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the above decision
only Gonzales and Angeles appealed </span>(G. <span style="">R. L-23303 and L-23304, respectively).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows that at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon of
August 28, 1963, while a delivery truck of the Central Salted Foods
Manufacturing Company driven by <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> King, with
truck helper Jose Tan beside him, was cruising near the corner of <span class="SpellE">Yakal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> streets,
Manila, an unidentified person stepped on its running board on the side of Tan,
while appellant Angeles stepped on the opposite running board beside King and
asked liquor money from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When King
refused to give, the unidentified man on the running board threw a stone at
Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stone hit the switch of the
truck and forced it to a stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon
King and Tan went down but were met with a volley of stones thrown at them by
Angeles, Gonzales, Bautista and others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon being hit King asked Tan to call a <span class="GramE">policeman.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tan then ran towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> street</st1:address></st1:street> where, with
the help of someone, he was able to contact a policeman, whom he informed that
they had been held up at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Yakal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> streets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having done this, Tan re­turned to the scene of the incident where he
found King sprawled on the gutter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
then hailed a tricycle and brought him to the <st1:place><st1:placename>North</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where, in spite of medical assistance, King died the following morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. David S. Cabrera of the Manila Police Department per­formed
an autopsy on the cadaver of the deceased and found the latter to have
sustained the following injuries:</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>clearly
deducible from the assignment of errors and statement of facts made in the
separate briefs submitted by appellants that they admit having been present at
the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzales,
however, denies having thrown stones at the deceased King, while Angeles claims
that the only thing he did was to pick up a small stone and throw it against
the glass window et the rear of the truck, and that when he was hit on the leg
by a stone he ran home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is clear
that the main questions raised by both appellants are factual.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court, after a
thorough examination of the evidence, including the sworn statements made by
the three defendants, arrived at the following conclusions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is then no dispute over the fact that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> King, driver of the delivery truck of the Central
Salted Foods Manufacturing Company, was stoned to death by several
persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three accused herein are
the only ones charged in connection with the said stoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as they are concerned, it is a
question of evidence whether they are guilty or not as co-participants in the
commission of this crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
witness of the prosecution who identified the three accused as among those who
took part in the stoning of the deceased is Jose Tan, the truck helper who was
on the truck during the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to him, these three persons,
particular­ly <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Angeles, who was the one who
asked for money for liquor, boarded the truck on the running board nearest the
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other person who boarded on
the other side of the truck on the running board has not been identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, among those who took part in the
stoning were not only <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Angeles but the two
other accused <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> Bautista and Armando Gonzales
in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> Bautista, who was arrested first, admitted having
stoned the deceased no less than 3 times with big stones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Angeles
was surrendered by his mother for being involved, admitted having taken part in
the said stoning of the Chinese and named his other com­panions.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Having </span>thus
participated in the act that led to the death of the <span style="">deceased, their responsibility </span>for the consequences remains the
same, whether it was their stones that finished with the deceased or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have acted in concert and, therefore,
answerable for the direct and natural consequences of their acts and those of
their companions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After going over the record ourselves we have come to the
conclusion that the evidence fully sustains the findings made by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Jose Tan unquestionably saw the incident at
close range and could not have been mistaken as to the identity of the parties
who attacked him and the deceased King.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He gave a straight forward narration of the incident and, as far as the
whole record is concerned, there <span style="">is </span>nothing
to indicate that he perjured himself and testified falsely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales' main contention, on the other hand, is that
the trial court erred in giving credence to the pro­secution <span style="">evidence in spite of the fact that the
evidence for the defense is more trustworthy and reliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, an examination of the
record has failed to disclose anything justifying the conclusion that the trial
judge had seriously misconstrued the evidence and had arrived at his
conclusions arbitrarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as he
had the advantage - which </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">denied
to us - of having heard the testimony of the witnesses, and had the opportunity
to observe their con­duct and demeanor on the witness stand, it is clear that
we must accept, as we do accept, his conclusions concerning the weight and credibility
of the evidence and of the witnesses presented by both parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>regards
Gonzales' contention that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the
crime of attempted robbery with homicide, the following must be taken into
consideration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzales, Angeles,
Bautista and their other companions, by concerted action, had shown that their
intention was to <u>extort money</u> when they stopped the truck driven by
King.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the latter refused to
capitulate to their demand, they assaulted him and his truck helper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that, according to the evidence,
only one of them actually demanded money from King, but there being sufficient
evidence of conspiracy, all his companions must also be deemed guilty of
attempted robbery (People <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Timbol</span>, G. R. L-47471-73, <span style="">August </span>4, 1944 and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Macabuhay</span>, G. R. L-16150, April 29, 1949).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends that, in the light of the facts
established by the evidence, the mitigating cir­cumstance of lack of intention
to commit so grave a wrong as the one actually committed be considered in favor
of appel­lants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>are constrained not to agree with such recommenda­tion
precisely because the evidence shows that, if not all the persons who attacked
the deceased King, at least some of them, intended to cause his death by
throwing at him stones <span style="">of such size and
weight as to cause, as in fact they caused, a fracture of his skull.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as the act of one or some of them <span style="">is </span>deemed to be the act of the others
in view of suf­ficient proof of conspiracy, <span class="GramE">We</span> believe
that the Court a quo was right in not considering such mitigating circumstance
in favor of appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
commission of the crime must be deemed aggravated by the circumstance that the </span><span style="">attackers </span><span style="">took advantage of their superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Since
</span><span style="">this cir­cumstance is </span><span style="">not alleged in the information, it </span><span style="">may only </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">considered as a </span><span style="">general </span><span style="">aggravating circumstance in the im­</span><span style="">position of the corresponding </span><span style="">penalty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The indemnity of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which appellants </span><span style="">were sen­tenced to pay, jointly and severally, <span style="">is </span>however raised to P12,000.00 in accordance with previous
rulings of </span><span style="">this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
