parties in the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> died on <st1:date year="1938" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1938</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only property left by him was a homestead

Original Certificate of Title No. 73 was issued in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after his death, five of his seven

physically partitioned among themselves the aforementioned home­stead, each one
taking actual and exclusive possession of the specific portion pertaining to
him/her, although no transfer certificate of title was issued in their

On <st1:date year="1949" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1949</st1:date>, Maria
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span> sold her share to Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>
with right of repurchase (<u>con</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u>
<u>retro</u>), which share is on the extreme northern part of the homestead,
more particularly des­cribed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A parcel of irrigated rice land covering an area of four (4)
and one-fourth hectares situated in the barrio of Curry, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pili</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>

<p class="BODY">Upon the insistence of Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>, the
deed of con­ditional sale was signed by all the brothers and sisters of Maria,
and soon after the execution of the deed <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> took
possession of the above-described property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1951, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, Marta <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> agreed
to sell absolutely to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> their
respective shares in the homestead for the total price of P8,500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing, however, that such sale could not be
validly effected because of the prohibition to alienate a homestead with­in five
years from the issuance of the patent, they agreed to execute the document of
sale later on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the mean­time, and
inasmuch as the share of Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> was still in
the possession of Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> by virtue of its
having been previously sold to him with right of repurchase, Fran­cisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> advanced the amount for the repurchase of Maria's
share from Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the repurchase price was offered to Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>, the latter refused to allow the repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>
brothers and sisters (<span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>, Pedro, Marta and
Maria), therefore, consigned the amount for the repurchase with the court and
filed Civil Case No. 1991 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> to compel Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>
to allow the repurchase and accept the <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
repurchase money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span> <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, the other sis­ter,
who had a share in the homestead, was joined as party defendant along with
Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> because she refused to join as a party
plaintiff with her brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1953" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1953</st1:date>,
Maria, Marta, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> and Pedro, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>
final­ly executed a deed of absolute sale whereby the said <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>
brothers and sisters ceded to the latter their res­pective shares in the
homestead inherited by them from their deceased father.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1954</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> in Civil Case No. 1991 ordering Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> to allow Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> to
repurchase the property that she had previously sold con­ditionally to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>
appealed from that decision to the Court of Appeals, and the latter court
affirmed the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon payment by
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1962</st1:date>, of the sum of P2,053.61 to the heirs of
Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
as finally determined by the Court of Appeals, said heirs surrendered the
possession of the land to <span class="SpellE">Cole­gado</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, or on September 7, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Teofi­la</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, thru her lawyer, addressed a letter to Fran­cisco
<span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> informing him of her desire to redeem the
parcel of land sold to him by Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> and at
the same time offering the sum of P2,053.61 as the redemption price of the land
-- which amount was later on deposited with the Clerk of Court -- but this
offer to redeem was refused by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 19, 1962, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span> commenced the present action against Fran­cisco
<span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> (Civil Case No.
5510), asserting that being a co-owner defendant <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>
can be compelled to allow her to exer­cise the right or legal redemption over
that portion which her sister Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> had
conditionally sold to Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> and later
repurchased from <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> by <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>,
in­voking the provision of Article 1620 of the Civil Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"A co-owner of a thing may exercise the right of redemption in
case the shares of all the other co-owners or of any of them, are sold to a
third person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the price of the
alienation is grossly exces­sive, the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
shall pay only a reasonable one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Should two or more co-owners desire to exercise the right of
redemption, they may only do so in proportion to the share they may
respectively have in the thing owned in common."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, which contains a counterclaim, defen­dant
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> maintains that plaintiff is now precluded
to redeem the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He bases
his stand on Article 1088 of the same Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and asserts that once a property is partitioned among the heirs, as in the case
at bar, the sale by any one of the heirs of his share to a third person cannot
be the subject of re­demption by his co-heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1964</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered its decision dismissing the complaint, as well as
defendant's counterclaim, with costs against plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its de­cision, the trial court made the
following findings and conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>"The partition of the homestead left by the deceased Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> is a fact undisputed by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the subject of their stipulation
which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That even before the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No.
73 on October 20, 1948 to the deceased Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>
the children of the said deceased immediate­ly after his death had already made
a physical partition of the land among themselves, although no trans­fer
certificate of title was actual­ly issued in favor of each heir to his or her
corresponding share'.</p>

<blockquote>"The partition conferred upon each heir 'the exclusive
ownership of the pro­perty adjudicated to him' (<span class="SpellE">Javelesa</span>
vs. Bar­rios, et al., 66 Phil. 107; Aliases vs. <span class="SpellE">Alcan­tara</span>,
16 Phil. 489, <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span>,
35 Phil. 679).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, after the
partition of the homestead of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>
immediately following his death on <st1:date year="1938" day="5" month="11">November
 5, 1938</st1:date>, the co-ownership or co-<span class="SpellE">heirship</span>
among his children ceased and each of them became the exclusive owner of the
portion of the homestead adjudica­ted to him or her own individual share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Con­sequently, <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Felices</span> is not a co-owner of the share of Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> in the said homestead and she has, therefore, no
right to redeem the same from Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant's counterclaim for damages is not supported by
the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is con­vincingly
disproved by the emphatic denial of the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the complaint and counter­claims are DISMISSED
with costs against the plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence the present appeal by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Teofila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Feli­ces</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question to be resolved in this appeal is whether, or
not, under the facts stated in the foregoing paragraphs, plaintiff-appellant
can exercise the right of legal redemption of the land in question from
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, pursuant to the provisions of
Article 1620 and/or Article 1088 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly held by the trial court, Article
1088 of the Civil Code has no application in the present case because said
article can only be availed of when a co-heir sells his share before the
partition of the hereditary estate<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That article refers to the hereditary right
itself, in the abstract sense, without specifying any particular por­tion,
although the proportionate participation of each co-heir is ascertainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This article presupposes that there has as
yet been no distribution of the estate among the heirs, for the moment such
distribution has taken place, even in a state of <u>pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></u>,
the heirs ceased to be considered simply as co-heirs, but they have thereby
become co-owners.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, if one of the co-owners sells his share to a stranger, a co-owner
may claim his right of redemption as a co-owner under Article 1620 of the Civil
Code<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>,
not as a co?heir under Article 1088 of the same Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">But in the instant case, We also find that plain­tiff-appellant
has no right to redeem the property as co-owner under Article 1620 of the Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Co-ownership exists when the
ownership of an <u>undivided </u>thing or right belongs to different persons<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an inherent and peculiar feature of
co-ownership that although the co-owners may have unequal shares in the common
property, quantitatively speaking, each co-owner has the same right in a
qualitative sense as any one of the other co-owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, every co-owner is the owner
of the whole, and over the whole he exercises the right of dominion, but he is
at the same time the owner of a por­tion which is truly abstract, because until
division is effected such portion is not concretely determined.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before Us, it is admitted by plaintiff-appellant
herself that immediately after the death of their father, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, she and her brothers and sisters divided or
partitioned the homestead among them­selves <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>,
each heir taking physical and exclusive possession and control of his or her
aliquot share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portion given to
Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, which plain­tiff-appellant now seeks
to redeem, is about one-fifth of the homestead on the northernmost part, marked
out by metes and bounds, as described in paragraph 3 of the com­plaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>
sold her share to Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span> in 1949, she delivered
to him the possession of the particular portion of the homestead constituting
her distinct share, and since then Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>, and
later his heirs upon his death, have continuously cultivated the land and
introduced improvements thereon until the posses­sion thereof was in turn
delivered to defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Francisco <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> in 1962 pursuant to the decision of the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no doubt
that at the time Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> sold her share to
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span>,
and even prior thereto when she ceded the same property to Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>, the community of interest over the entire homestead
of their father between her (Maria) and her brothers and sisters had already
ceased, and so the claim of plaintiff-appellant to redeem the property under
Article 1620 can not be sustained because when that property was sold by Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> to defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> she
(plaintiff-appellant) was no longer a co-owner of that particular
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following ruling of this
Court; speaking through Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, is pertinent to the
resolution of the issue in the present case:</p>

<blockquote>"The foregoing theory is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tested against the concept of co-ownership,
as authoritatively expressed by the commentators, appellant is not a co-owner
of the registered parcel of land, taken as a unit or subject of co-ownership,
since he and the spouses do not 'have a spiritual part of a thing which is not
physically di­vided' (3 Sanchez Roman 162), nor is each of them an 'owner of
the whole, and over the whole he exercises the right of domi­nion, but he is at
the same time the owner of a portion which is truly abstract....’ (3 <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city> 405).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The portions of appel­lant-plaintiff and of
the defendant spouses are correctly determined and identi­fiable, for to the
former belongs the northern half, and to the latter be­longs the remaining
southern half, of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That their
respective por­tions are not technically described, or that said portions are
still embraced in one and the same certificate of title, does not make said
portions less determinable or identifiable, or dis­tinguishable, one from the
other, nor that dominion over each portion less exclusive, in their respective
owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, no right of redemption
among co-owners, exists." (De la Cruz v. Cruz, et al., L-27759, April 17,
1970, 32 SCRA, 307, 311).<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing sufficiently disposes of the issue raised in this
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, even granting the claim
of plaintiff-appellant that co-ownership of the home­stead still existed as of
the time defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> repurchased the share of
Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> from Roman <span class="SpellE">Iriola</span>
still she can not exercise the right of legal redemption of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The record shows that on <st1:date year="1953" day="11" month="9">September
 11, 1953</st1:date> defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Colegado</span> bought the respective shares of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, and Marta <span class="SpellE">Felices</span> in the
homestead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By such purchase defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had thereby become a co-owner of the
homestead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> thereafter paid for the portion allotted to Maria <span class="SpellE">Felices</span>, in August, 1962, he was at that time not a
stranger but already a co-owner of the homestead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, plaintiff-appellant can not redeem the
land from defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> because the lat­ter and
plaintiff-appellant had become co-owners, and as co-owners neither of them has
the right of legal re­demption against the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case of Viola v. <span class="SpellE">Roura</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> (49 Phil., 808), this Court held that the right of
legal redemption is not limited solely and ex­clusively to original co-owners
but applies as well to those who subsequently acquire the respective shares of
the co-owners while the community exists.</p>
