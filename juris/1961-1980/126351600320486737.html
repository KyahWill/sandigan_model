				G.R. No. L-22265, March 27, 1968</h4>
				<H3>COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS.
GOODRICH INTERNATIONAL RUBBER CO., RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the decision of December 22, 1967, this Court modified that of
the Court of Tax Appeals, and ruled that respondent's alleged representation
expenses were fully taxable; it also reduced the claim for bad debts up to
P22,627.35 only.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant Collector of Internal Revenue has now filed
a motion for reconsideration praying that the Court order also the payment by
respondent of 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest as provided in section 51(e)
of the National Internal Revenue Code (before it was amended by Republic Act
No. 2343).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Goodrich
International Rubber Co. opposes this motion on the ground that this claim for
surcharge and monthly interest was not specifi­cally pointed out in
petitioner's assignment of errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing, however, that the imposition of the 5% sur­charge
and 1% monthly interest is required expressly by the statute, the Court <span style="">believes </span>that the failure to assign it
as error should not be an obstacle to its imposition where proper, considering
that "taxes are the life-blood of the government and their prompt and
certain availability an imperious need" (Bull v. U. S., 79 L. Ed. 1421,
1427).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding the motion for reconsideration meritorious, the
dispositive part of our main decision is hereby modified by adding a paragraph
reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The respondent is therefore ordered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay the sum of P8,439.00, as deficiency
income tax for 1952, plus the 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest thereon from
July 20, 1956 until full pay­ment thereof; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To pay the sum of P7,612.66 as deficiency
income tax for 1951, plus the 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest, there­on
from December 29, 1957 until full pay­ment thereof."</blockquote>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
