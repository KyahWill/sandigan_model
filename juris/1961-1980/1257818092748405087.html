				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present case was &nbsp;forwarded to Us by the Court of &nbsp;First Instance &nbsp;of Manila for compulsory &nbsp;review, the defendants &nbsp;(Criminal Case No. &nbsp;52339 of the lower court) having been sentenced to death, etc. On &nbsp;March 13, &nbsp;1963, Atty. Agustin R. Homeres, with address at 1-A Road &nbsp;8 St., Project &nbsp;6, &nbsp;Quezon City, &nbsp;was notified &nbsp;by registered mail to file his brief &nbsp;for appellants&nbsp; Loreto Saber on and &nbsp;Jesus Felicia within thirty (30) &nbsp;days from notice. &nbsp; <p>The corresponding retain card appears &nbsp;to &nbsp;have been signed by one S. Flores on April 22, 1963.</p> <p>On May &nbsp;13, 1963, the Clerk of &nbsp;this &nbsp;Court addressed a letter to the Chief of Police, &nbsp;Quezon City, with another copy of the notice mentioned above, &nbsp;with the request that the same be &nbsp;served upon Atty. Homeres, and to inform the court thereafter of &nbsp;the date &nbsp;of said &nbsp;service. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief of Police &nbsp;of Quezon City subsequently &nbsp; reported &nbsp;in writing that &nbsp;the notice was delivered to &nbsp;Mrs. Soledad &nbsp;C. Homeres on June 9 1963.</p> <p>On June 14, &nbsp;1963,&nbsp; we passed a resolution&nbsp; requiring Atty. &nbsp;Homeres to explain, within &nbsp;ten &nbsp;(10) days &nbsp;from notice, why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for his failure to file the brief for his clients, notice in &nbsp;connection therewith &nbsp;having been &nbsp;served upon him (apparently through one S. Flores, as stated above), since April 22 &nbsp;of the &nbsp;same &nbsp;year. &nbsp;No explanation appears to have been submitted by him, but on July 8, 1963, he filed an urgent petition for a thirty (30) day extension of time, alleging &nbsp;therein &nbsp;that he &nbsp;had received the &nbsp;notice to file brief only on June 9, &nbsp;1963, &nbsp;(the notice &nbsp;served through the Quezon City Police Department). This &nbsp;petition was granted by our resolution of July 15 &nbsp;of &nbsp;the same year. Prior to this, however, it appears &nbsp;that due to the non-filing of the brief by Atty. Homeres within the time given in the first notice for the purpose, dated March &nbsp;13, 1963, and received by &nbsp;one S. Flores &nbsp;on April 22 &nbsp;of the same year, Atty. &nbsp;Rafael Ortigas, Jr. &nbsp;was appointed counsel de officio for Saberon and Felicia and required to &nbsp;prepare their brief within thirty &nbsp;(30) days &nbsp;from notice. &nbsp;On July 29 of the same year, &nbsp;Atty. Ortigas appear &nbsp;to have filed a motion for thirty &nbsp;(30) days extension which was also granted by &nbsp;our resolution of August 8, 1963.</p> <p>On June 27, 1963, we &nbsp;passed a resolution imposing a fine of P100.00 upon Atty. Agustin Homeres for his failure to file the brief for appellants Saberon and Felicia, &nbsp;copy of which resolution was addressed to him at 1-A Road 8 St., Project 6, Quezon City, &nbsp;but was returned to sender because it was not &nbsp;claimed by the addressee.</p> <p>Finally, on August 8, 1963, Atty. Homeres filed a written explanation coupled with a petition for thirty &nbsp;(30) days extension from August 9, 1963, alleging that he had not received the notice of March 13, &nbsp;1963; that the S. Flores who appears to &nbsp;have received the same on &nbsp;his behalf on April 22, 1963 is &nbsp;totally unknown to him and was not &nbsp;a resident &nbsp;of 1-A Road 8 &nbsp;St., Project 6, Quezon City; that the only notice &nbsp;he had received was &nbsp;the &nbsp;one served upon his &nbsp;wife &nbsp;through &nbsp;the Quezon City Police Department &nbsp;on June 9, 1963, in connection with which, on July 8 of the same year, he filed a motion for an extension of thirty &nbsp;(30) &nbsp;days, &nbsp;which was granted, the extension to expire &nbsp;on August &nbsp;9 of the &nbsp;same year.</p> <p>We do not find in the record any conclusive proof that the S. Flores who appears to have received the first notice to file brief &nbsp;was duly authorized by Atty. Homeres. On the other hand, what the record discloses is that a second notice was duly served on him, through his wife, by the Quezon &nbsp; City &nbsp;Police Department, on June 9, 1963 and that before the period therein given expired, he filed &nbsp;the corresponding motion for &nbsp;thirty &nbsp;(30) days extension, &nbsp;which was &nbsp; granted &nbsp;by our resolution of July 15, 1963, the &nbsp;extension to expire on August 9 of the same year, &nbsp;and that on August 8, he filed a second &nbsp;motion for an extension of thirty &nbsp;(30) &nbsp;days.</p> <p>In view of &nbsp;all &nbsp;the foregoing, &nbsp;our resolution &nbsp;of June 27, 1963 imposing a fine of P100.00 &nbsp;upon Atty. Homeres is hereby set aside, &nbsp;and his &nbsp;last motion is &nbsp; granted and he is hereby granted a definitely last extension &nbsp;of &nbsp;thirty (30) &nbsp;days from notice hereof within which to file the brief for appellants Saberon and Felicia.</p> <p>The appointment of Atty. Rafael Ortigas, Jr. as counsel de officio for the same appellants is hereby set aside, and let the corresponding notice be served on him accordingly.</p> <p><i>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Anqelo, Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, Regala</i> and <i>&nbsp; Makalintal &nbsp;JJ.,</i> concur.</p> </div>
