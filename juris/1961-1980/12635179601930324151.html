				G.R. No. L-30669, July 31, 1970</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF: BETTY PO
(BETTY PO LIM-MARITAL NAME) TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC
 OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR-APPELLANT.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dated <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1968</st1:date> allowing Betty Po
Lim to take the oath of allegiance as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after the lapse of thirty (30) days from the promulgation thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 31, 1965 <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, a native
born Chinese woman married to Lim Son Hue, also a registered Chinese subject,
filed with the lower court a petition for admission as citizen of the
Philippines under Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing the lower court granted the petition on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic's motion for re­consideration
was denied on December 12 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1968</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion praying that she be allowed
to take the oath of allegiance under the provisions of Republic Act 530, and on
September 13 of the same year the lower court, notwithstanding the opposition
filed by the Republic, issued the appealed order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question now raised by the Republic is whether a Chinese
woman may be lawfully naturalized as a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
separately from her husband - also a citizen of the Republic of China.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was
married to Lim Son Hue in Iloilo City on December 25, 1960, that is, four years
and a half <u>prior</u> to the filing of her appli­cation for
naturalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of their marriage
they begot two children, the first born on <st1:date year="1962" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1962</st1:date> and the second on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1963</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that upon her marriage, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, aside from being a Chinese citizen by birth and
parentage, became a Chinese citizen by marriage in accordance with the
provisions of Article 2, Chapter 2 of the Chinese Law of Naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, under Commonwealth Act No. 63, a Filipino
woman loses her citizenship upon contracting marriage to an alien if by virtue
of the laws in force in her husband's country she acquires the latter's nationality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant being a Chinese citizen by birth and marriage can not
become a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>, because, as long as her marriage to
an alien subsists, she must by our laws have the same citizenship as that of
her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> contends, that
our Naturalization Law does not say that only male alien persons may seek
citizenship by naturalization, but in construing this provision We must
necessarily take into account other legal provisions on the subject of
citizenship, one of them being the one mentioned heretofore, according to which
a Filipino female citizen who marries an alien acquires the latter's
citizenship by the mere fact of her marriage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The granting of citizenship by naturalization to a female alien
applicant while her marriage to another alien is subsisting would, therefore,
be inoperative for the reason that, such grant notwithstanding, she would still
be deemed to be a citizen of the country of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result would be dual citizenship which,
it is believed, is not contemplated by our laws.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed order is reversed and set aside,
with costs.</p>
