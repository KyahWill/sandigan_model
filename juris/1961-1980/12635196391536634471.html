				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue raised, one of first impression by the way, is simple
and uncomplicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In deciding two labor
cases on June 30, 1970,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court resolved to refer the matter back to respondent Court of Industrial
Relations so that the claim of petitioner National Power Corporation, the
employer, that the strike of the labor union was illegal, could be determined
before the economic demands that had to be considered in Such cases should be
passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once remanded and the
hearing set before respondent Court, there was an order by its Presiding Judge,
<span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>,
to the effect that there would be a simultaneous reception of evidence on both
the legality of the strike as well as such economic demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner duly made its objection, but it
did not prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would insist on a
prior resolution of the legality of the strike.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was opposed to another kind of evidence being offered in the
meanwhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It brought the matter to
respondent Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was rebuffed a second time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence this petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As noted at the outset, the question does not possess too much
difficulty, but in view of its novel character, the petition was given due
course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a study of the matter, it
is the conclusion of this Court that the order of respondent Court challenged
is not tainted by any legal error of consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition must be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dispute arose in this wise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1970</st1:date>
decision remanded the labor cases to respondent Court for this reason:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No adverse effect would be entailed if
the Court of Industrial Relations would pass upon squarely as to whether the
strike was legal before deciding the other issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no question as to the legality of
its power in the meanwhile to order the strikers to go back to work and thus
avoid the dire possibility foreseen in the certification of 'huge economic
losses, untold inconveniences and grave dangers to safety and human lives.' The
Court is of the opinion that while the doctrine of the Philippine Can Co. case
had been relaxed where we felt that the legality of a strike need not be
inquired into, the situation confronting the Court of Industrial Relations here
was such that a determination of the validity of this strike is crucial to the
proper disposition of the matter."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After the remand, petitioner filed a motion for the deferment of further
hearing on the matter until after the issue of legality of the strike of August
30, 1968 was finally resolved, On November 7, 1970, as noted, its Presiding
Judge issued an order denying such motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was his view that a simultaneous hearing on the legality as well as
the economic issues raised would not be inconsistent with the ruling of this
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was therein stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A joint hearing of the strike legality
and the economic issues, *** is not inconsistent with the above ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before passing upon the economic issue
this Court would decide the question of whether the strike of <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1968</st1:date> was legal or not, if
legal, dispose of the economic issue in the same decision and appeals, if any,
could be made to the Supreme Court questions of fact and law on all issues
raised in one proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To defer
hearing on the economic issue until the legality of the strike is finally
resolved would mean delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the view
to facilitating the early termination of the cases, considering that the issues
are before the same <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> of this Court and the
evidence in both issues are common or identical, it will be for an orderly
administration of justice that the question of whether or not the strike was
illegal and the economic issue be heard jointly."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a motion for reconsideration of such order of <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="11">November <span style="">7, </span>1970</st1:date>,
but it was denied by the respondent Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised, as was made clear at the outset, calls for an
answer adverse to that of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Court; in sustaining the order of its Presiding Judge, did
not act in contravention of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no merit to this petition for review.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why such should be the
answer is not difficult to <span style="">unde</span>rstand.
There has been throughout all these years a recognition of the broad range of
discretion vested in respondent Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is necessarily so in line with the responsibility thrust upon it as
the governmental agency for effectuating the state policy on the solution of
labor disputes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assumption has been
that with the wealth of experience thus gained in coping with the specific and
limited sphere with which it deals, it could be trusted on the whole to arrive
at solutions that are in accordance with the objectives of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus we do not feel called upon to set aside
or disregard what it has decreed, save in clear cases of nonÂ­compliance with
the applicable juridical norms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
so with reference to the result reached.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It is no less true as to the procedure followed by it.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The same approach is thus reflected both as to what has been done and how it
has come about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it has been in the
past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it should be in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this, as in so many branches of public law, Justice Laurel
blazed the trail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first case, <span class="SpellE">Goseco</span> v. Court of Industrial Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where the extent of the power of respondent Court to fashion its procedural
ways was passed upon, the basic principle was stated by him thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Justice, equity and the substantial
merits of their cases are the keynote <span style="">and
controlling considerations of the law,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> How such a doctrine did apply to the facts
of this particular dispute, he explained in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is in this obvious spirit of the law
that the respondent court denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration
assailing its jurisdiction, in the following words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'In view of the substantial merits of the
case and in the interest of justice and equity, we are inclined to disregard in
the present instance in favor of the laborers the application of the rigid
rules of procedure and to declare, as we hereby do, without merit the second
ground of the motion.' *** To rule, therefore, that the decision of the
respondent court of December 28, 1937, attained finality ten days after its
rendition in the sense that it became immune from further and subsequent
revision or amendment, and that the respondent court, in so amending what it
thought was not reflective of justice and equity, went beyond the bounds of its
jurisdiction, is to uproot the very purpose of the law and to countenance the
very mischief which it seeks to avoid, namely, the subjection of the respondent
court to the technicalities of procedure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is one of the cases where this court, by self-imposed limitation,
should decline to override the judgment of the Court of Industrial
Relations."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">liberality with which
the judiciary has appraised the modes of procedure of administrative tribunals
is equally evident in American Law. In his authoritative Administrative Law
Treatise,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Davis</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> summarized the matter as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Administrative hearings follow no
single pattern. * * * Practices are extremely diverse, sometimes even within
the same agency. Procedures vary all the way from a trial-type hearing to a
public meeting, with all proportions of mixture of the two. Rare cases in which
questions about hearing methods or order of proceedings have gone to court show
judicial reluctance to upset administrative discretion."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a different
matter, of course, if the challenged order could be assailed as deviating from
our decision of <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing however on the face thereof
that would indicate that there was such an absence of conformity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that was required by us is that
respondent Court determine the validity of the strike before passing upon the
economic issues raised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
in what was held by us that would require it to hear the matter separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing of a failure to abide by
our pronouncement, much less an intent to defy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, it would seem that the procedure now being followed would be
characterized by promptness and dispatch in the disposition of labor disputes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if its decision would be that the strike
was legal, then, necessarily, it would have to give due weight to the merits of
the economic demands, if any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, if the strike were declared illegal, nothing is lost if in the
meanwhile the other issues are heard by it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances then, there is no justification for us to set
aside the order complained of.</p>
