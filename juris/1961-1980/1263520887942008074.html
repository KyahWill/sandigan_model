				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an original action for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibi­tion,
and <i>mandamus</i>, with a prayer for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary
Injunction, filed by the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against the
Hon. <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>,
Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch
VII.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The material facts alleged in the
petition are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1965</st1:date>,
a complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
by Gov. Rene <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
and the Municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>, Ronda, <span class="SpellE">Bogo</span> and others, against Mayor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>,
Jr., City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Priscillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacquiao</span> and other public
officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the complaint was
entitled "for injunction, etc.," the action was in reality one to
declare "Resolution No. 186 of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and the Deed of Donation executed pursuant thereto, null, void and inexistence
or in the alternative, to order its annulment and revocation for breach of its
Principal Terms and Conditions," (Civil Case No. 238-BC).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of the complaint, the same was sub­mitted to the
respondent judge who, in accordance with the petition for the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction,
issued the aforesaid writ enjoining the defend­ants named in the complaint to
refrain "from selling, <span style="">transferring,
or in any way disposing of any of the 210 province-owned lots subject matter of
the questioned donation and from executing any deed of sale, transfer,
conveyance or confirmation purporting to convey title to any of the lots
referred to in favor of any person, firm or corporation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1965</st1:date>,
one of the defendants – the herein <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> – filed a motion to dis­miss the
complaint on the grounds of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
plaintiffs' lack of legal capacity to sue, and (2) improper venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Mayor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, Jr.
automatically ceased to be Mayor of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> upon the filing of his cer­tificate
of candidacy for senator on <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1965</st1:date>, Carlos J. <span class="SpellE">Cuizon</span> was substituted
in his place in his capaci­ty as Mayor of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter he filed a similar motion to
dismiss the complaint citing in support thereof <span class="GramE">Our</span>
decision in Norberto <span class="SpellE">Lumpay</span> vs. Hon. Segundo <span class="SpellE">Moscoso</span>, G.R. L-14723 (promulgated on <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1959</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1965</st1:date>,
the respondent judge denied the motion to dismiss and ordered the defendants to
answer the com­plaint within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1965</st1:date>,
the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>
filed its answer assailing in one of the affirmative defenses set forth therein
the authority of the respondent judge to take cognizance of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1966</st1:date>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> filed a motion for the
reconsideration of the respondent judge's order of <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1965</st1:date> insofar as it denied the transfer of the
case to the proper branch of the Court of First Instance stationed at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was denied by the respondent
judge on <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1966</st1:date>,
and subsequently, set the case for pre-trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petition at bar, the Seventh Branch of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> presided over by the
respondent judge, is a new branch created by Rep. Act 2613, amending the Judiciary
Act of 1948, providing for eight judges to preside over the Court of First
Instance of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, six of them to be stationed in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and one each of the remaining two in the
Municipalities of <span class="SpellE">Barili</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bogo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law just mentioned, however, did not
determine the particular municipalities over which Branch VII of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> would exercise judicial
authority until the Department of Justice issued under date of August 20, 1962
Administrative Order 302, pursuant to Sec. 27 of the Judiciary Act of 1948,
which provided that said branch would take cognizance of cases coming from the
twelve municipalities therein mentioned, all situated on the western part of
the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing facts, petitioner contends that inasmuch as
the 210 lots subject matter of the resolution of the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and of the Deed of Donation sought to be annulled were
within the territorial limits of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Civil Case No. 238-BC should be taken cognizance of by any of the judges
presiding over any of the six branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> stationed in said city; that, as the respondent judge
pre­sided over Branch VII stationed in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Barili</span>,
he had no authority to take cognizance of said case and, as a result, all his
actuations therein are void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have noticed that Administrative Order 302 at­tached as Annex
B to the petition, after enumerating the different municipalities and
apportioning among the eight branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> the cases filed therein, says "that whenever the
interest of the ad­ministration of justice so requires, any judge of the eight
branches of the Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> may try any case coming
from any municipality, with the previous approval of this De­partment." In
plain words, with the previous approval of the Department of Justice, the
respondent judge would be competent to take cognizance of Civil Case No.
238-BC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that nowhere in the petition be­fore Us is it
alleged that the respondent judge had taken cognizance of said case and issued
orders therein without previous approval of the Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We deem an allegation to this effect as vital
and indispensable for the petition under consideration to state a case of <u>lack
of authority</u> on the part of the respondent judge be­cause, without such
allegation, the presumption must be that His Honor was acting regularly, and
that official duty in connection with the transfer of the case from any of the
branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
stationed in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City to Branch VII stationed in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Barili</span> had been duly complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have arrived at the above conclusion on the strength of the
following considerations:</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether plaintiffs' action subject of Civil Case No. 238-BC is a <u>personal
</u>action or a <u>real</u> action, it cannot be denied that any of the
branches of the Court of First Instance of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
whether stationed in the City of the same name or in any of the municipalities
of the province, would be proper venue for its trial and de­termination, it
being admitted that the parties are resi­dents of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and the lands in question are within its territorial
limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only by reason of the
apportionment of cases effected through Administra­tive Order No. 302 that it
may be claimed that the Seventh Branch stationed in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Barili</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
has no au­thority to take cognizance of the aforesaid case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as already adverted to, said Executive
Order recognizes the authority of any of the branches of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to take cognizance of any case
coming from any City or Municipality of the province, if the interest of the
administration of justice so demands and the approval of the Department of
Justice had been pre­viously secured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is clear therefore that, for a party who assails the authority of Branch VII of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to take
cognizance of Civil Case No. 238-BC, said party must allege affirmatively that
the approval of the Department of Justice had not been pre­viously secured and
that the exercise of authority over the case by the aforesaid branch was not
demanded by the interest of the administration of justice.</p>
