				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i> and
injunction, with prayer for issuance of writ of preliminary injunction, arose
out of two cases filed by petitioner with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span class="GramE"><i>SEC CASE NO.</i></span><i> 1375<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 22, 1976, petitioner, as stockholder of respondent San
Miguel Corporation, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a
petition for "declaration of nullity of amended by-laws, cancellation of
certificate of filing of amended by-laws, injunction and damages with prayer
for a preliminary injunction" against the majority of the members of the
Board of Directors and San Miguel Corporation as an unwilling petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition, entitled "John <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span>, Jr., vs. Andres <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
Jr., Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buñao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Walthrode</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span> and San Miguel Corporation," was docketed as
SEC Case No. 1375.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a first cause of action, petitioner alleged that on September
18, 1976, individual respondents amended the by-laws of the corporation, basing
their authority to do so on a resolution of the stockholders adopted on March
13, 1961, when the outstanding capital stock of respondent corporation was only
P70<span class="GramE">,139,740.00</span>, divided into 5,513,974 common shares
at P10.00 per share and 150,000 preferred shares at P100.00 per share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the amendment, the outstanding
and paid up shares <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> 30,127,043, with a total
par value of P301<span class="GramE">,270,430.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was contended that according to section 22
of the Corporation Law and Article VIII of the by-laws of the corporation, the
power to amend, modify, repeal or adopt new by-laws may be delegated to the
Board of Directors only by the affirmative vote of stockholders representing
not less than 2/3 of the subscribed and paid up capital stock of the
corporation, which 2/3 should have been computed on the basis of the
capitalization at the time of the amendment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the amendment was based on the 1961 authorization, petitioner
contended that the Board acted without authority and in usurpation of the power
of the stockholders.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a second cause of action, it was alleged that the authority
granted in 1961 had already been exercised in 1962 and 1963, after which the
authority of the Board ceased to exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a third cause of action, petitioner averred that the
membership of the Board of Directors had changed since the authority was given
in 1961, there being six (6) new directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a fourth cause of action, it was claimed that prior to the
questioned amendment, petitioner had all the qualifications to be a director of
respondent corporation, being a substantial stockholder thereof; that as a
stockholder, petitioner had acquired rights inherent in stock ownership, such
as the rights to vote and to be voted upon in the election of directors; and
that in amending the by-laws, respondents purposely provided for petitioner's
disqualification and deprived him of his vested rights as afore-mentioned,
hence the amended by-laws are null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As additional causes of action, it was alleged that corporations
have no inherent power to disqualify a stockholder from being elected as a
director and, therefore, the questioned act is <i>ultra</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>vires</i></span>
and void; that Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and/or Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, while representing other corporations, entered
into contracts (specifically a management contract) with respondent
corporation, which was allowed because the questioned amendment gave the Board
itself the prerogative of determining whether they or other persons are engaged
in competitive or antagonistic business; that the portion of the amended
by-laws which states that in determining whether or not a person is engaged in
competitive business, the Board may consider such factors as business and
family relationship, is unreasonable and oppressive and, therefore, void; and
that the portion of the amended by-laws which requires that "all nominations
for election of directors * * * shall be submitted in writing to the Board of
Directors at least five (5) working days before the date of the Annual
Meeting" is likewise unreasonable and oppressive.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was, therefore, prayed that the amended by-laws be declared
null and void and the certificate of filing thereof be cancelled, and that
individual respondents be made to pay damages, in specified amounts, to
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 28, 1976, in connection with the same case, petitioner
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an "Urgent Motion for
Production and Inspection of Documents," alleging that the Secretary of
respondent corporation refused to allow him to inspect its records despite
request made by petitioner for production of certain documents enumerated in
the request, and that respondent corporation had been attempting to suppress
information from its stockholders despite a negative reply by the SEC to its
query regarding their authority to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among the documents requested to be copied were:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) minutes of the stockholder's meeting held
on March 13, 1961; (b) copy of the management contract between San Miguel
Corporation and A. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> Corporation (ANSCOR); (c)
latest balance sheet of San Miguel International, Inc.; (d) authority of the stockholders
to invest the funds of respondent corporation in San Miguel International,
Inc.; and (e) lists of salaries, allowances, bonuses, and other compensation,
if any, received by Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and/or
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> from San Miguel <span class="GramE">International,
Inc. and/or its successor-in-interest.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The "Urgent Motion for Production and Inspection of
Documents" was opposed by respondents, alleging, among others, that the
motion has no legal basis; that the demand is not based on good faith; that the
motion is premature since the materiality or relevance of the evidence sought
cannot be determined until the issues are joined; that it fails to show good
cause and constitutes continued harassment; and that some of the information
sought are not part of the records of the corporation and, therefore,
privileged.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the motion for
production, respondents San Miguel Corporation, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>,
Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Prieto</span>
filed their answer to the petition, denying the substantial allegations therein
and stating, by way of affirmative defenses that "the action taken by the
Board of Directors on September 18, 1976 resulting in the * * * amendments is
valid and legal because the power to 'amend, modify, repeal or adopt new
By-laws' delegated to said Board on March 13, 1961 and long prior thereto has
never been revoked, withdrawn or otherwise nullified by the stockholders of
SMC"; that contrary to petitioner's claim, "the vote requirement for
a valid delegation of the power to amend, repeal or adopt new by-laws is
determined in relation to the total subscribed capital stock at the time the
delegation of said power is made, not when the Board opts to exercise said
delegated power”; that petitioner has not availed of his intra-corporate remedy
for the nullification of the amendment, which is to secure its repeal by vote
of the stockholders representing a majority of the subscribed capital stock at
any regular or special meeting, as provided in Article VIII, section 1 of the
by-laws and section 22 of the Corporation Law, hence the petition is premature;
that petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the
amendments on the ground of lack of authority of the Board, since he failed to
object to other amendments made on the basis of the same 1961 authorization;
that the power of the corporation to amend its by-laws is broad, subject only
to the condition that the by-laws adopted should not be inconsistent with any
existing law; that respondent corporation should not be precluded from adopting
protective measures to minimize or eliminate situations where its directors
might be tempted to put their personal interests over that of the corporation;
that the questioned amended by-laws is a matter of internal policy and the
judgment of the Board should not be interfered with; that the by-laws, as
amended, are valid and binding and are intended to prevent the possibility of
violation of criminal and civil laws prohibiting combinations in restraint of
trade; and that the petition states no cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, therefore, prayed that the petition
be dismissed and that petitioner be ordered to pay damages and attorney's fees
to respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application for writ
of preliminary injunction was likewise opposed on various grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> filed their opposition to the
petition, denying the material averments thereof and stating, as part of their
affirmative defenses, that in August 1972, the Universal <span class="SpellE">Robina</span>
Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Robina</span>), a corporation engaged in
business competitive to that of respondent corporation, began acquiring shares
therein, until September 1976 when its total holding amounted to 622,987
shares; that in October 1972, the Consolidated Foods Corporation (CFC) likewise
began acquiring shares in respondent corporation, until its total holdings
amounted to P543,959.00 in September 1976; that on January 12, 1976,
petitioner, who is president and controlling shareholder of <span class="SpellE">Robina</span>
and CFC (both closed corporations) purchased 5,000 shares of stock of
respondent corporation, and thereafter, in behalf of himself, CFC and <span class="SpellE">Robina</span>, "conducted malevolent and malicious publicity
campaign against SMC" to generate support from the stockholder "in
his effort to secure for himself and in representation of <span class="SpellE">Robina</span>
and CFC interests, a seat in the Board of Directors of SMC," that in the
stockholders' meeting of March 18, 1976, petitioner was rejected by the
stockholders in his bid to secure a seat in the Board of Directors on the basic
issue that petitioner was engaged in a competitive business and his securing a
seat would have subjected respondent corporation to grave disadvantages; that
"petitioner nevertheless vowed to secure a seat in the Board of Directors
at the next annual meeting"; that thereafter the Board of Directors amended
the by-laws as afore-stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">As counterclaims, actual damages, moral damages, exemplary
damages, expenses of litigation and attorney's fees were presented against
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, a Joint Omnibus Motion for the striking out of the
motion for production and inspection of documents was filed by all the
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was duly opposed by
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture,
respondents <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>,
Sr. and Eduardo R. <span class="SpellE">Visaya</span> were allowed to intervene
as <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> and they accordingly filed their
oppositions-in-intervention to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1976</st1:date>,
the Securities and Exchange Commission resolved the motion for production and
inspection of documents by issuing Order No. 26, Series of 1977, stating, in
part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the evidence submitted before the Commission by
the petitioner and respondents in the above-entitled case, it is hereby
ordered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That respondents produce and permit the
inspection, copying and photographing, by or on behalf of the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">movant</span>, John <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span>, Jr., of
the minutes of the stockholders' meeting of the respondent San Miguel
Corporation held on March 13, 1961, which are in the possession, custody and
control of the said corporation, it appearing that the same is material and
relevant to the issues involved in the main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the respondents should allow
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> entry in the principal office of
the respondent Corporation, San Miguel Corporation on January 14, 1977, at 9:30
o'clock in the morning for purposes of enforcing the rights herein granted; it
being understood that the inspection, copying and photographing of the said
documents shall be undertaken under the direct and strict supervision of this
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, that
other documents and/or papers not heretofore included are not covered by this
Order and any inspection thereof shall require the prior permission of this
Commission;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the Balance Sheet of San Miguel
International, Inc. as well as the list of salaries, allowances, bonuses,
compensation and/or remuneration received by respondent Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and Andres <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
from San Miguel International, Inc. and/or its successors-in-interest, the
Petition to produce and inspect the same is hereby DENIED, as petitioner-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> is not a stockholder of San Miguel International,
Inc. and has, therefore, no inherent right to inspect said documents;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the Manifestation of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> dated November 29, 1976, with drawing his request to
copy and inspect the management contract between San Miguel Corporation and A. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> Corporation and the renewal and amendments thereof
for the reason that he had already obtained the same, the Commission takes note
thereof; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Commission holds in abeyance
the resolution on the matter of production and inspection of the authority of
the stockholders of San Miguel Corporation to invest the funds of <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> in San Miguel International, Inc.,
until after the hearing on the merits of the principal issues in the above entitled
case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Order is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon
its approval."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Dissatisfied with the foregoing Order,
petitioner moved for its reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1976</st1:date>, while the petition was yet to be heard, <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> issued a notice of special
stockholders' meeting for the purpose of "ratification and confirmation of
the amendment to the By-laws," setting such meeting for <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted petitioner to ask respondent
Commission for a summary judgment insofar as the first cause of action is
concerned, for the alleged reason that by calling a special stockholders'
meeting for the aforesaid purpose, private respondents admitted the invalidity
of the amendments of September 18, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for summary judgment was opposed by private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending action on the motion, petitioner
filed an "Urgent Motion for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining
Order," praying that pending the determination of petitioner's application
for the issuance of a preliminary injunction and/or petitioner's motion for
summary judgment, a temporary restraining order be issued, restraining
respondents from holding the special stockholders' meeting as scheduled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was duly opposed by respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1977</st1:date>,
respondent Commission issued an order denying the motion for issuance of
temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
receipt of the order of denial, respondents conducted the special stockholders'
meeting wherein the amendments to the by-laws were ratified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1977</st1:date>, petitioner filed a consolidated motion for contempt and
for nullification of the special stockholders' meeting.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the order denying petitioner's
motion for summary judgment was filed by petitioner before respondent
Commission on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleges that up to the time of the
filing of the instant petition, the said motion had not yet been scheduled for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the motion for
reconsideration of the order granting in part and denying in part petitioner's
motion for production of records had not yet been resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the fact that the annual stockholders' meeting of <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> had been scheduled for <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1977</st1:date>, petitioner filed with
respondent Commission a Manifestation stating that he intended to run for the
position of director of respondent corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, respondents filed a Manifestation with respondent
Commission, submitting a Resolution of the Board of Directors of <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> disqualifying and precluding
petitioner from being a candidate for director unless he could submit evidence
on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1977</st1:date> that he does
not come within the disqualifications specified in the amendment to the
by-laws, subject matter of SEC Case No. 1375.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By reason thereof, petitioner filed a manifestation and motion to
resolve pending incidents in the case and to issue a writ of injunction,
alleging that private respondents were seeking to nullify and render ineffectual
the exercise of jurisdiction by the respondent Commission, to petitioner's
irreparable damage and prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Allegedly despite subsequent Manifestation to prod respondent Commission
to act, petitioner was not heard prior to the date of the stockholders’
meeting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that there appears a deliberate and concerted
inability on the part of the SEC to <span class="GramE">act,</span> hence
petitioner came to this Court.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span class="GramE"><i>SEC CASE NO.</i></span><i> 1423<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner likewise alleges that, having discovered that
respondent corporation has been investing corporate funds in other corporations
and businesses outside of the primary purpose clause of the corporation, in
violation of section 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law, he filed with respondent
Commission, on January 20, 1977, a petition seeking to have private respondents
Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, as well as the respondent corporation declared
guilty of such violation, and ordered to account for such investments and to
answer for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1977</st1:date>,
motions to dismiss were filed by private respondents, to which a consolidated
motion to strike and to declare individual respondents in default and an
opposition <i>ad <span class="SpellE">abundantiorem</span> <span class="SpellE">cautelam</span></i>
were filed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
fact that said motions were filed as early as February 4, 1977, the Commission acted
thereon only on April 25, 1977, when it denied respondents' motions to dismiss
and gave them two (2) days within which to file their answer, and set the case
for hearing on April 29 and May 3, 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents issued notices of the annual stockholders' meeting,
including in the Agenda thereof, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reaffirmation of the authorizations to the
Board of Directors by the stockholders at the meeting on March 20, 1972 to
invest corporate funds in other companies or businesses or for purposes other
than the main purpose for which the Corporation has been organized, and
ratification of the investments thereafter made pursuant thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By reason of the foregoing, on April 28, 1977, petitioner filed
with the SEC an urgent motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction to restrain private respondents from taking up Item 6 of the Agenda
at the annual stockholders' meeting, requesting that the same be set for
hearing on May 3, 1977, the date set for the second hearing of the case on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission, however,
cancelled the dates of hearing originally scheduled and reset the same to May
16 and 17, 1977, or after the scheduled annual stockholders' meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the purpose of urging the Commission to
act, petitioner filed an urgent manifestation on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1977</st1:date>, but this notwithstanding, no action has been
taken up to the date of the filing of the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the afore-mentioned SEC cases, it is petitioner's
contention before this Court that respondent Commission gravely abused its
discretion when it failed to act with deliberate dispatch on the motions of
petitioner seeking to prevent illegal and/or arbitrary impositions or
limitations upon his rights as stockholder of respondent corporation, and that respondents
are acting oppressively against petitioner, in gross derogation of petitioner's
rights to property and due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
prayed that this Court direct respondent SEC to act on collateral incidents
pending before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 6, 1977, this Court issued a temporary restraining order
restraining private respondents from disqualifying or preventing petitioner
from running or from being voted as director of respondent corporation and from
submitting for ratification or confirmation or from causing the ratification or
confirmation of Item 6 of the Agenda of the annual stockholders' meeting on May
10, 1977, or from making effective the amended by-laws of respondent
corporation, until further orders from this Court or until the Securities and
Exchange Commission acts on the matters complained of in the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1977</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Supplemental Petition, alleging that after a restraining
order had been issued by this Court, or on <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1977</st1:date>, the respondent Commission served upon petitioner
copies of the following orders:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Order No. 449, Series of 1977 (SEC Case No.
1375); denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration, with its supplement, of
the order of the Commission denying in part petitioner's motion for production
of documents, petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the order denying the
issuance of a temporary restraining order, and petitioner's consolidated motion
to declare respondents in contempt and to nullify the stockholders' meeting;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Order No. 450, Series of 1977 (SEC Case No.
1375), allowing petitioner to run as a director of respondent corporation but
stating that he should not sit as such if elected, until such time that the
Commission has decided the validity of the by-laws in dispute, and denying
deferment of Item 6 of the Agenda for the annual stockholders' meeting; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Order No. 451, Series of 1977 (SEC Case No.
1375), denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the order of
respondent Commission denying petitioner's motion for summary judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's assertions anent the foregoing orders, (1)
that respondent Commission acted with indecent haste and without circumspection
in issuing the aforesaid orders to petitioner's irreparable damage and injury;
(2) that it acted without jurisdiction and in violation of petitioner' right to
due process when it decided <i>en banc</i> an issue not raised before it and
still pending before one of its Commissioners, and without hearing petitioner
thereon despite petitioner's request to have the same calendared for hearing;
and (3) that the respondents acted oppressively against the petitioner in
violation of his rights as a stockholder, warranting immediate judicial
intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is prayed in the supplemental petition that the SEC orders
complained of be declared null and void and that respondent Commission be
ordered to allow petitioner to undertake discovery proceedings relative to San
Miguel International, Inc. and thereafter to decide SEC Cases Nos. 1375 and
1423 on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1977</st1:date>,
respondent SEC, Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> filed their comment, alleging that the petition is
without merit for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the petitioner and the interests he
represents are engaged in businesses competitive and antagonistic to that of
respondent San Miguel Corporation, it appearing that he owns and controls a
greater portion of his SMC stock thru the Universal <span class="SpellE">Robina</span>
Corporation and the Consolidated Foods Corporation, which corporations are
engaged in businesses directly and substantially competing with the allied
businesses of respondent SMC and of corporations in which SMC has substantial
investments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, when CFC and <span class="SpellE">Robina</span> had accumulated shares in SMC, the Board of
Directors of SMC realized the clear and present danger that competitors or

access to SMC's business and trade secrets and plans;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the amended by-laws were adopted to
preserve and protect respondent SMC from the clear and present danger that
business competitors, if allowed to become directors, will illegally and
unfairly utilize their direct access to its business secrets and plans for
their own private gain to the irreparable prejudice of respondent SMC, and,
ultimately, its stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further,
it is asserted that membership of a competitor in the Board of Directors is a
blatant disregard of no less than the Constitution and pertinent laws against
combinations in restraint of trade;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the by-laws are valid and binding since
a corporation has the inherent right and duty to preserve and protect itself by

<span class="SpellE">lite</span></i>, the amended by-laws calendared for
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was emphasized that it was
only on <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1977</st1:date> that
petitioner calendared the aforesaid petition for suspension (preliminary
injunction) for hearing on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant petition being dated <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1977</st1:date>, it is apparent that
respondent Commission was not given a chance to act "with deliberate
dispatch"; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> even assuming
that the petition was meritorious, it has become moot and academic because
respondent Commission has acted on the pending incidents complained of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, therefore, prayed that the petition
be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 21, 1977, respondent <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>, Sr. filed his comment, alleging that the
petition has become moot and academic for the reason, among others, that the
acts of private respondents sought to be enjoined have reference to the annual
meeting of the stockholders of respondent San Miguel Corporation, which was
held on May 10, 1977; that in said meeting, in compliance with the order of
respondent Commission, petitioner was allowed to run and be voted for as
director; and that in the same meeting, Item 6 of the Agenda was discussed,
voted upon, ratified and confirmed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, it was averred that the questions and issues raised by
petitioner are pending in the Securities and Exchange Commission which has
acquired jurisdiction over the case, and no hearing on the merits has been had;
hence the elevation of these issues before the Supreme Court is premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a reply to the aforesaid comments, stating that
the petition presents <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> questions for the
determination of this Court because (1) the respondent Commission acted without
circumspection, unfairly and oppressively against petitioner, warranting the
intervention of this Court; (2) a derivative suit, such as the instant case, is
not rendered academic by the act of a majority of stockholders, such that the
discussion, ratification and confirmation of Item 6 of the Agenda of the annual
stockholders' meeting of May 10, 1977 did not render the case moot; that the
amendment to the by-laws which specifically bars petitioner from being a
director is void since it deprives him of his vested rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission, thru the Solicitor General, filed a
separate comment, alleging that after receiving a copy of the restraining order
issued by this Court and noting that the restraining order did not foreclose
action by it, the Commission <i>en banc</i> issued Orders Nos. 449, 450 and 451
in SEC Case No. 1375.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer to the allegation in the supplemental petition, it
states that Order No. 450 which denied deferment of Item 6 of the Agenda of the
annual stockholders' meeting of respondent corporation, took into consideration
an urgent manifestation filed with the Commission by petitioner on May 3, 1977
which prayed, among others, that the discussion of Item 6 of the Agenda be
deferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given for denial of
deferment was that "such action is within the authority of the corporation
as well as falling within the sphere of stockholders' right to know, deliberate
upon and/or to express their wishes regarding disposition of corporate funds
considering that their investments are the ones directly affected."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that the main petition has,
therefore, become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 29, 1977, petitioner filed a second supplemental
petition with prayer for preliminary injunction, alleging that the actuations
of respondent SEC tended to deprive him of his right to due process, and
"that all possible questions on the facts now pending before the
respondent Commission are now before this Honorable Court which has the
authority and the competence to act on them as it may see fit." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 927-928.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in his memorandum, submits the following issues for
resolution:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">whether</span> or not the

<p class="BODY">Respondents Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, Jr. and
Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> similarly pray that this Court
resolve the legal issues raised by the parties in keeping with the

To the same effect is the prayer of San Miguel Corporation that this Court
resolve on the merits the validity of its amended by-laws and the rights and

"the time spent and effort exerted by the parties concerned and, more

this Court denied remand of the third-party complaint to the trial court for

resolved to decide the cases on the merits, instead of remanding them to the
trial court where (a) the ends of justice would not be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>
by the remand of the case; or (b) where public interest demands an early

stockholders ostensibly pursuant to section 22 of the Corporation Law; that in
a special meeting on February 10, 1977 held specially for that purpose, the
amended by-laws were ratified by more than 80% of the stockholders of record;
that the foreign investment in the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Brewery
and Distillery, a beer manufacturing company in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>,
was made by the San Miguel Corporation in 1948; and that in the stockholders'

<p class="BODY"><i>Whether or not the amended by-laws of SMC disqualifying a

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that the amended by-laws are invalid and
unreasonable because they were "tailored to suppress the minority and
prevent them from having representation in the Board," at the same time
depriving petitioner of his "vested right" to be voted for and to
vote for a person of his choice as director.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, respondents Andres M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
Jr., Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and San Miguel Corporation
content that exclusion of a competitor from the Board is a legitimate corporate
purpose, considering that being a competitor, petitioner cannot devote an
unselfish and undivided loyalty to the corporation; that it is essentially a
preventive measure to assure stockholders of San Miguel Corporation of
reasonable protection from the unrestrained self-interest of those charged with
the promotion of the corporate enterprise; that access to confidential
information by a competitor may result either in the promotion of the interest
of the competitor at the expense of the San Miguel Corporation, or the
promotion of both the interests of petitioner and respondent San Miguel
Corporation, which may, therefore, result in a combination or agreement in
violation of Article 186 of the Revised Penal Code by destroying free
competition to the detriment of the consuming public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further argued that there is no vested
right of any stockholder under Philippine law to be voted as director of a
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is alleged that petitioner, as of May
6, 1978 has exercised, personally or thru two corporations owned or controlled
by him, control over the following shareholdings in San Miguel Corporation, <i>viz</i>.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) John <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span>,
Jr. - 6,325 shares; (b) Universal <span class="SpellE">Robina</span> Corporation
- 738,647 shares; (c) CFC Corporation - 658,313 shares, or a total of 1,403,285
shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Since the
outstanding capital stock of San Miguel Corporation, as of the present date, is
represented by 33,139,749 shares with a par value of P10.00, the total shares
owned or controlled by petitioner represents 4.2344% of the total outstanding
capital stock of San Miguel Corporation.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also contended that petitioner is the president and substantial
stockholder of Universal <span class="SpellE">Robina</span> Corporation and CFC
Corporation, both of which are allegedly controlled by petitioner and members
of his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also claimed that
both the Universal <span class="SpellE">Robina</span> Corporation and the CFC
Corporation are engaged in businesses directly and substantially competing with
the allied businesses of San Miguel Corporation, and of corporations in which
SMC has substantial investments.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i>AUTHORITY OF CORPORATION TO PRESCRIBE QUALIFICATIONS
OF DIRECTORS EXPRESSLY CONFERRED BY LAW<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents contend that the disputed amended by-laws
were adopted by the Board of Directors of San Miguel Corporation as a measure
of self-defense to protect the corporation from the clear and present danger
that the election of a business competitor to the Board may cause upon the
corporation and the other stockholders "irreparable prejudice."
Submitted for resolution, therefore, is the issue -- whether or not respondent
San Miguel Corporation could, as a measure of self-protection, disqualify a
competitor from nomination and election to its Board of Directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is recognized by all authorities that "every corporation has
the inherent power to adopt by-laws 'for its internal government, and to

affairs.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
At common law, the rule was "that the power to make and adopt by-laws was <i>inherent</i>
in every corporation as one of its necessary and inseparable legal
incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is settled throughout
the United States that in the absence of positive legislative provisions
limiting it, every private corporation has this inherent power as one of its
necessary and inseparable legal incidents, independent of any specific enabling
provision in its charter or in general law, such power of self-government being
essential to enable the corporation to accomplish the purposes of its
creation."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, under section 21 of the Corporation Law, a
corporation may prescribe in its by-laws "the qualifications, duties and
compensation of directors, officers and employees * * *." This must
necessarily refer to a qualification in addition to that specified by section
30 of the Corporation Law, which provides that "every director must own in
his right at least one share of the capital stock of the stock corporation of
which he is a director * * *." In <i>Government v. El Hogar</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a>
the Court sustained the validity of a provision in the corporate by-law
requiring that persons elected to the Board of Directors must be holders of
shares of the paid up value of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which shall
be held as security for their action, on the ground that section 21 of the
Corporation Law expressly gives the power to the corporation to provide in its
by-laws for the qualifications of directors and is "highly prudent and in
conformity with good practice."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i>NO VESTED RIGHT OF STOCKHOLDER TO BE ELECTED DIRECTOR<o:p></o:p></i></p>

To this extent, therefore, the stockholder may be considered to have "parted
with his personal right or privilege to regulate the disposition of his
property which he has invested in the capital stock of the corporation, and
surrendered it to the will of the majority of his fellow incorporators. * * *

changes, diminishes or restricts the rights of the existing shareholders, then
the dissenting minority has only one right, <i>viz</i>.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"to object thereto in writing and demand

section 22 of the same law, the owners of the majority of the subscribed
capital stock may amend or repeal any by-law or adopt new by-laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said, therefore, that petitioner
has a <i>vested</i> right to be elected director, in the face of the fact that
the law at the time such right as stockholder was acquired contained the
prescription that the corporate charter and the by-law shall be subject to
amendment, alteration and modification.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i>AN AMENDMENT TO THE CORPORATE BY-LAW WHICH RENDERS A
STOCKHOLDER INELIGIBLE TO BE DIRECTOR, IF HE BE ALSO DIRECTOR IN A CORPORATION

SUSTAINED AS VALID<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled state law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, according to Fletcher, that
corporations have the power to make by-laws declaring a person employed in the
service of a rival company to be ineligible for the corporation's Board of
Directors. "* * * (A)n amendment which renders ineligible, or if elected,
subjects to removal, a director if he be also a director in a corporation whose

valid."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
This is based upon the principle that where the director is so employed in the
service of a rival company, he cannot serve both, but must betray one or the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an amendment "advances
the benefit of the corporation and is good."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An exception exists in <st1:state><st1:place>New
  Jersey</st1:place></st1:state>, where the Supreme Court held that the
Corporation Law in <st1:state><st1:place>New Jersey</st1:place></st1:state>
prescribed the only qualification, and therefore the corporation was not
empowered to add additional qualifications.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a> This is the exact opposite of the
situation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
because as stated heretofore, section 21 of the Corporation Law expressly
provides that a corporation may make by-laws for the qualifications of
directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that
an officer of a corporation cannot engage in a business in direct competition
with that of the corporation where he is a director by utilizing information he
has received as such officer, under "the established law that a director
or officer of a corporation may not enter into a competing enterprise which
cripples or injures the business of the corporation of which he is an officer
or director."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a></p>

corporation cancelled a contract of the corporation for exclusive sale of a
foreign firm's products, and after establishing a rival business, the directors
entered into a new contract themselves with the foreign firm for exclusive sale
of its products, the court held that equity would regard the new contract as an
offshoot of the old contract and, therefore, for the benefit of the
corporation, as a "faultless fiduciary may not reap the fruits of his

(c) research and development; and (d) sources of funding, availability of personnel,
proposals of mergers or tie-ups with other firms.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obviously to prevent the creation of an opportunity for an
officer or director of San Miguel Corporation, who is also the officer or owner
of a competing corporation, from taking advantage of the information which he
acquires as director to promote his individual or corporate interests to the
prejudice of San Miguel Corporation and its stockholders, that the questioned
amendment of the by-laws was made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, where two corporations are competitive in a substantial

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Thus, in <i>McKee Co. v.</i></span><i> First
National Bank of </i><st1:city><st1:place><i>San Diego</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>,

by-laws of a bank, requiring that its directors should not be directors,
officers, employees, agents, nominees or attorneys of any other banking
corporation, affiliate or subsidiary thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Chief Judge Parker, in <i>McKee</i>, explained the reasons of the court,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * A bank director has access to a great deal of
information concerning the business and plans of a bank which would likely be
injurious to the bank if known to another bank, and it was reasonable and
prudent to enlarge this minimum disqualification to include any director,
officer, employee, agent, nominee, or attorney of any other bank in California.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><i>Ashkins</i></span>
case, supra, specifically recognizes protection against rivals and others who <i>might</i>
acquire information which <i>might</i> be used against the interests of the
corporation as a legitimate object of by-law protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to attorneys or persons associated
with a firm which is attorney for another bank, in addition to the direct
conflict or potential conflict of interest, there is also the danger of
inadvertent leakage of confidential information through casual office
discussions or accessibility of files.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant's directors determined that its welfare was best protected if
this opportunity for conflicting loyalties and potential misuse and leakage of
confidential information was foreclosed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>McKee</i>, the Court further listed <span class="SpellE">qualificational</span>
by-laws upheld by the courts, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A director shall not be directly or
indirectly interested as a stockholder in any other firm, company, or
association which competes with the subject corporation.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A director shall not be the immediate member of
the family of any stockholder in any other firm, company, or association which
competes with the subject corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A director shall not be an officer, agent,
employee, attorney, or trustee in any other firm, company, or association which
competes with the subject corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A director shall be of good moral character
as an essential qualification to holding office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No person who is an attorney against the
corporation in a law suit is eligible for service on the board." <span class="GramE">(At p. 7.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These are not based on <span class="SpellE">theorical</span>
abstractions but on human experience — that a person cannot serve two hostile
masters without detriment to one of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The offer and assurance of petitioner that to avoid any
possibility of his taking unfair advantage of his position as director of San
Miguel Corporation, he would absent himself from meetings at which confidential
matters would be discussed, would not detract from the validity and
reasonableness of the by-laws here involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apart from the impractical results that would ensue from such
arrangement, it would be inconsistent with petitioner's primary motive in
running for board membership -- which is to protect his investments in San
Miguel Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More important, such
a proposed norm of conduct would be against all accepted principles underlying
a director's duty of fidelity to the corporation, for the policy of the law is
to encourage and enforce responsible corporate management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As explained by Oleck:<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a>
"The law will not tolerate the passive attitude of directors * * * without
active and conscientious participation in the managerial functions of the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As directors, it is their duty
to control and supervise the day to day business activities of the company or
to promulgate definite policies and rules of guidance with a vigilant eye
toward seeing to it that these policies are carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only then that directors may be said to
have fulfilled their duty of fealty to the corporation."</p>

<p class="BODY">Sound principles of corporate management counsel against sharing
sensitive information with a director whose fiduciary duty of loyalty may well
require that he disclose this information to a competitive rival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These dangers are enhanced considerably where
the common director such as the petitioner is a controlling stockholder of two
of the competing corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
seem manifest that in such situations, the director has an economic incentive
to appropriate for the benefit of his own corporation the corporate plans and
policies of the corporation where he sits as director.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, access by a competitor to confidential information
regarding marketing strategies and pricing policies of San Miguel Corporation
would subject the latter to a competitive disadvantage and unjustly enrich the
competitor, for advance knowledge by the competitor of the strategies for the
development of existing or new markets of existing or new products could enable
said competitor to utilize such knowledge to his advantage.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is another important consideration in determining whether

trade" and "unfair competition" appear to have a well defined
meaning in other jurisdictions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
"monopoly" embraces any combination the tendency of which is to
prevent competition in the broad and general sense, or to control prices to the
detriment of the public.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a> In short, it is the concentration
of business in the hands of a few.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
material consideration in determining its existence is not that prices are
raised and competition actually excluded, but that <i>power</i> exists to raise
prices or exclude competition when desired.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a> Further, it must be considered
that the idea of monopoly is now understood to include a condition produced by
the mere act of individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
dominant thought is the notion of exclusiveness or unity, or the suppression of
competition by the unification of interest or management, or it may be thru
agreement and concert of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
in brief, unified tactics with regard to prices.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing definitions, it is apparent that the
contentions of petitioner are not in accord with reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election of petitioner to the Board of <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> can bring about an illegal
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because an express
agreement is not necessary for the existence of a combination or conspiracy in
restraint of trade.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a> It is enough that a concert of
action is contemplated and that the defendants conformed to the <span class="GramE">arrangements,<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">41</span></span></a></span> and what is to be
considered is what the parties actually did and not the words they used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the Clayton Act prohibits a
person from serving at the same time as a director in any two or more
corporations, if such corporations are, by virtue of their business and
location of operation, <i>competitors</i> so that the elimination of
competition between them would constitute violation of any provision of the
anti-trust laws.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">42</span></span></a>
There is here a statutory recognition of the anti-competitive dangers which may
arise when an individual simultaneously acts as a director of two or more
competing corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A common
director of two or more competing corporations would have access to
confidential sales, pricing and marketing information and would be in a
position to coordinate policies or to aid one corporation at the expense of
another, thereby stifling competition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This situation has been aptly explained by Travers, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The argument for prohibiting competing corporations from
sharing even one director is that the <i>interlock permits the coordination of
policies between nominally independent firms to an extent that competition
between them may be completely eliminated.</i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, if a director, for example, is to be faithful to both
corporations, some accommodation must result.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suppose X is a director of both Corporation A and Corporation B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>X could hardly vote for a policy by A that
would injure B without violating his duty of loyalty to B; at the same time he
could hardly abstain from voting without depriving A of his best judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>If the firms really do compete</i> -- in
the sense of vying economic advantage at the expense of the other -- <i>there
can hardly be any reason</i> for an interlock between competitors other than
the suppression of competition."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">43</span></span></a> (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the Report of the House Judiciary Committee of the
U.S. Congress on section 9 of the Clayton Act, it was established that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"By means of the interlocking
directorates one man or group of men have been able to dominate and control a
great number of corporations * * * to the detriment of the small ones dependent
upon them and to the injury of the public."<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">44</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Shared information on cost accounting may lead to price
fixing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, shared information on
production, orders, shipments, capacity and inventories may lead to control of
production for the purpose of controlling prices.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, if a competitor has access to the pricing policy and
cost conditions of the products of San Miguel Corporation, the essence of
competition in a free market for the purpose of serving the lowest priced goods
to the consuming public would be frustrated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The competitor could so manipulate the prices of his products or vary
its marketing strategies by region or by brand in order to get the most out of
the consumers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the two competing
firms control a substantial segment of the market this could lead to collusion
and combination in restraint of trade.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reason and experience point to the inevitable conclusion that the
inherent tendency of interlocking directorates between companies that are
related to each other as competitors is to blunt the edge of rivalry between
the corporations, to seek out ways of compromising opposing interests, and thus
eliminate competition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As respondent SMC
aptly observes, knowledge by CFC-<span class="SpellE">Robina</span> of SMC's
costs in various industries and regions in the country will enable the former
to practice price discrimination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CFC-<span class="SpellE">Robina</span> can segment the entire consuming population by
geographical areas or income groups and change varying prices in order to
maximize profits from every market segment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>CFC-<span class="SpellE">Robina</span> could determine the most profitable
volume at which it could produce for every product line in which it competes
with SMC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Access to SMC pricing policy
by CFC-<span class="SpellE">Robina</span> would in effect destroy free
competition and deprive the consuming public of opportunity to buy goods of the
highest possible quality at the lowest prices.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, considering that both <span class="SpellE">Robina</span>
and SMC are, to a certain extent, engaged in agriculture, then the election of
petitioner to the Board of SMC may constitute a violation of the prohibition
contained in section 13(5) of the Corporation Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said section provides in part that "any
stockholder of more than one corporation organized for the purpose of engaging
in agriculture may hold his stock in such corporations <i>solely for investment</i>
and not for the purpose of bringing about or attempting to bring about a
combination to exercise control of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>such
corporations * * *."</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither are <span class="GramE">We</span> persuaded by the claim
that the by-law was intended to prevent the candidacy of petitioner for
election to the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the by-law
were to be applied in the case of one stockholder but waived in the case of
another, then it could be reasonably claimed that the by-law was being applied
in a discriminatory manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
by-law, by its terms, applies to all stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The equal protection clause of the
Constitution requires only that the by-law operate equally upon all persons of
a class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, before petitioner can
be declared ineligible to run for director, there must be hearing and evidence
must be submitted to bring his case within the ambit of the
disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sound principles of
public policy and management, therefore, support the view that a by-law which
disqualifies a competition from election to the Board of Directors of another
corporation is valid and reasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of any legal prohibition or overriding public
policy, wide latitude may be accorded to the corporation in adopting measures
to protect legitimate corporate interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, "where the reasonableness of a by-law is a mere matter of
judgment, and upon which reasonable minds must necessarily differ, a court
would not be warranted in substituting its judgment instead of the judgment of
those who are authorized to make by-laws and who have expressed their authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">45</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although it is asserted that the amended by-laws confer on the
present Board powers to perpetuate themselves in power, such fears appear to be
misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This power, by its very
nature, is subject to certain well established limitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these is inherent in the very concept
and definition of the terms "competition" and
"competitor."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Competition" implies a struggle for advantage between two or
more forces, each possessing, in substantially similar if not identical degree,
certain characteristics essential to the business sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It means an independent endeavor of two or
more persons to obtain the business patronage of a third by offering more
advantageous terms as an inducement to secure trade.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">46</span></span></a>
The test must be whether the business does in fact compete, not whether it is
capable of an indirect and highly unsubstantial duplication of an isolated or
non-characteristic activity.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">47</span></span></a> It is, therefore, obvious that not
every person or entity engaged in business of the same kind is a competitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such factors as quantum and place of
business, identity of products and area of competition should be taken into
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore,
necessary to show that petitioner's business covers a substantial portion of
the same markets for similar products to the extent of not less than 10% of <span class="GramE">respondent corporation's</span> market for competing products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="GramE">We</span> here
sustain the validity of the amended by-laws, it does not follow as a necessary
consequence that petitioner is <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> disqualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consonant with the requirement of due
process, there must be due hearing at which the petitioner must be given the
fullest opportunity to show that he is not covered by the
disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As trustees of the
corporation and of the stockholders, it is the responsibility of directors to
act with fairness to the stockholders.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">48</span></span></a> Pursuant to this obligation and to
remove any suspicion that this power may be utilized by the incumbent members
of the Board to perpetuate themselves in power, any decision of the Board to
disqualify a candidate for the Board of Directors should be reviewed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission <i>en</i> <i>banc</i> and its decision shall
be final unless reversed by this Court on <i>certiorari</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">49</span></span></a>
Indeed, it is a settled principle that where the action of a Board of Directors
is an abuse of discretion, or forbidden by statute, or is against public
policy, or is <i>ultra</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>vires</i></span>, or is a
fraud upon minority stockholders or creditors, or will result in waste,
dissipation or misapplication of the corporate assets, a court of equity has
the power to grant appropriate relief.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">50</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Whether or not respondent SEC gravely abused its discretion in
denying petitioner's request for an examination of the records of San Miguel
International, Inc., a fully owned subsidiary of San Miguel Corporation -<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent San Miguel Corporation stated in its memorandum that
petitioner’s claim that he was denied inspection rights as stockholder of SMC
"was made in the teeth of undisputed facts that, over a specific period,
petitioner had been furnished numerous documents and information," to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a complete list of stockholders
and their stockholdings; (2) a complete list of proxies given by the
stockholders for use at the annual stockholders' meeting of May 18, 1975; (3) a
copy of the minutes of the stockholders' meeting of March 18, 1976; (4) a
breakdown of SMC's P186.6 million investment in associated companies and other
companies as of December 31, 1975; (5) a listing of the salaries, allowances,
bonuses and other compensations or remunerations received by the directors and
corporate officers of SMC; (6) a copy of the US$100 million Euro-Dollar Loan
Agreement of SMC; and (7) copies of the minutes of <i>all</i> meetings of the
Board of Directors from January 1975 to May 1976, with deletions of sensitive
data, which deletions were not objected to by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, it was averred that upon request, petitioner was
informed in writing on September 18, 1976:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) that SMC's foreign investments are handled by San Miguel
International, Inc., incorporated in Bermuda and wholly owned by SMC; this was
SMC's first venture abroad, having started in 1948 with an initial outlay of
P500,000.00, augmented by a loan of <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> $6
million from a foreign bank under the personal guaranty of SMC's former
President, the late Col. Andres <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>; (2) that as
of December 31, 1975, the estimated value of SMI would amount to almost P400
million; (3) that the total cash dividends received by SMC from SMI since 1953
has amounted to US$9.4 million; and (4) that from 1972-1975, SMI did not
declare cash or stock dividends, all earnings having been used in line with a
program for the setting up of breweries by SMI.</p>

<p class="BODY">These averments are supported by the affidavit of the Corporate
Secretary, enclosing photocopies of the afore-mentioned documents.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">51</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the second paragraph of section 51 of the Corporation
Law, "(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> record of all business transactions
of the corporation and minutes of any meeting shall be open to the inspection
of any director, member or stockholder of the corporation at reasonable
hours."</p>

<p class="BODY">The stockholder's right of inspection of the corporation's books
and records is based upon their ownership of the assets and property of the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, an incident
of ownership of the corporate property, whether this ownership or interest <span class="GramE">be</span> termed an equitable ownership, a beneficial ownership, or
a quasi-ownership.<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">52</span></span></a> This right is predicated upon the
necessity of self-protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
generally held by majority of the courts that where the right is granted by
statute to the stockholder, it is given to him as such and must be exercised by
him with respect to his interest as a stockholder and for some purpose germane
thereto or in the interest of the corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">53</span></span></a> In other words, the inspection has
to be germane to the petitioner's interest as a stockholder, and has to be
proper and lawful in character and not inimical to the interest of the
corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">54</span></span></a>
In <i>Grey v. Insular Lumber</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">55</span></span></a> this Court held that "the right
to examine the books of the corporation must be exercised in good faith, for
specific and honest purpose, and not to gratify curiosity, or for speculative
or vexatious purposes."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weight
of judicial opinion appears to be, that on application for <i>mandamus</i> to
enforce the right, it is proper for the court to inquire into and consider the
stockholder's good faith and his purpose and motives in seeking inspection.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">56</span></span></a>
Thus, it was held that "the right given by statute is not absolute and may
be refused when the information is not sought in good faith or is used to the
detriment of the corporation."<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">57</span></span></a> But the "impropriety of
purpose such as will defeat enforcement must be set up by the corporation
defensively if the Court is to take cognizance of it as a qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the specific provisions take
from the stockholder the burden of showing propriety of purpose and place upon
the corporation the burden of showing impropriety of purpose or motive."<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">58</span></span></a>
It appears to be the "general rule that stockholders are entitled to full
information as to the management of the corporation and the manner of
expenditure of its funds, and to inspection to obtain such information,
especially where it appears that the company is being mismanaged or that it is
being managed for the personal benefit of officers or directors or certain of
the stockholders to the exclusion of others."<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">59</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While the right of a stockholder to examine the books and records
of a corporation for a lawful purpose is a matter of law, the right of such
stockholder to examine the books and records of a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the corporation in which he is a stockholder is a different thing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some state courts recognize the right under certain conditions,
while others do not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held
that where a corporation owns approximately no property except the shares of
stock of subsidiary corporations which are merely agents or instrumentalities
of the holding company, the legal fiction of distinct corporate entities may be
disregarded and the books, papers and documents of all the corporations may be
required to be produced for examination,<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">60</span></span></a> and that a writ of <i>mandamus</i>
may be granted, as the records of the subsidiary were, to all intents and
purposes, the records of the parent even though the subsidiary was not named as
a party.<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">61</span></span></a>
<i>Mandamus</i> was likewise held proper to inspect both the subsidiary's and
the parent corporation's books upon proof of sufficient control or dominion by
the parent showing the relation of principal or agent or something similar
thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">62</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <i>mandamus</i> at the suit of a stockholder
was refused where the subsidiary corporation is a separate and distinct
corporation domiciled and with its books and records in another jurisdiction,
and is not legally subject to the control of the parent company, although it
owned a vast majority of the stock of the subsidiary.<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">63</span></span></a>
Likewise, inspection of the books of an allied corporation by a stockholder of
the parent company which owns all the stock of the subsidiary has been refused
on the ground that the stockholder was not within the class of "persons
having an interest."<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">64</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <i>Nash</i> case,<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">65</span></span></a> The Supreme Court of New York held
that the contractual right of former stockholders to inspect books and records
of the corporation "included the right to inspect corporation's
subsidiaries' books and records which were in corporation's possession and
control in its office in <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <i>Bailey</i> case,<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">66</span></span></a> stockholders of a corporation were
held entitled to inspect the records of a controlled subsidiary corporation
which used the same offices and had identical officers and directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his "Urgent Motion for Production and Inspection of
Documents" before respondent SEC, petitioner contended that respondent
corporation "had been attempting to suppress information from the
stockholders" and that petitioner, "as stockholder of respondent
corporation, is entitled to copies of some documents which for some reason or
another, respondent corporation is very reluctant in revealing to the petitioner
notwithstanding the fact that no harm would be caused thereby to the
corporation."<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">67</span></span></a> There is no question that
stockholders are entitled to inspect the books and records of a corporation in
order to investigate the conduct of the management, determine the financial
condition of the corporation, and generally take an account of the stewardship
of the officers and directors.<a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">68</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, considering that the foreign subsidiary is
wholly owned by respondent San Miguel Corporation and, therefore, under its
control, it would be more in accord with equity, good faith and fair dealing to
construe the statutory right of petitioner as stockholder to inspect the books
and records of the corporation as extending to books and records of such wholly
owned subsidiary which are in respondent corporation's possession and control.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner reiterates his contention in SEC Case No. 1423 that
respondent corporation invested corporate funds in SMI without prior authority
of the stockholders, thus violating section 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law, and
alleges that respondent SEC should have investigated the charge, being a
statutory offense, instead of allowing ratification of the investment by the
stockholders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent SEC's position is that submission of the investment to
the stockholders for ratification is a sound corporate practice and should not
be thwarted but encouraged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 17-1/2 of the Corporation Law allows a corporation to
"invest its funds in any other corporation or business or for any purpose
other than the main purpose for which it was organized" provided that its
Board of Directors has been so authorized by the affirmative vote of
stockholders holding shares entitling them to exercise at least two-thirds of

made in pursuance of the corporate purpose, it does not need the approval of

<p class="BODY">As stated by <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span>, the
purchase of beer manufacturing facilities by SMC was an investment in the same
business stated as its main purpose in its Articles of Incorporation, which is
to manufacture and market beer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that the original investment was made in 1947-1948, when SMC, then San
Miguel Brewery, Inc., purchased a beer brewery in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> Brewery &amp; Distillery, Ltd.) for the
manufacture and marketing of San Miguel beer thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Restructuring of the investment was made in
1970-1971 thru the organization of SMI in <st1:place>Bermuda</st1:place> as <span class="GramE">a tax</span> free reorganization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, the ruling in <i>De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> v. Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> Sugar Central Co.,

said case, one of the issues was the legality of an investment made by Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> Sugar Central Co., Inc., without prior resolution
approved by the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the stockholders' voting power, in
the Philippine Fiber Processing Co., Inc., a company engaged in the manufacture
of sugar bags. The lower court said that "there is more logic in the stand
that if the investment is made in a corporation whose business is important to
the investing corporation and would aid it in its purpose, to require authority
of the stockholders would be to unduly curtail the power of the Board of

its corporate funds "in any other corporation or business, or for any
purpose other than the main purpose for which it was organized, provided that
'its board of directors has been so authorized in a resolution by the
affirmative vote of stockholders holding shares in the corporation entitling
them to exercise at least two-thirds of the voting power on such a proposal at
a stockholders' meeting called for that purpose,' and provided further, that no
agricultural or mining corporation shall in anywise be interested in any other
agricultural or mining corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>When

its articles of incorporation, the approval of the stockholder is not necessary</i>."'

<p class="BODY">Assuming <span class="SpellE"><i>arguendo</i></span> that the Board
of Directors of SMC had no authority to make the assailed investment, there is
no question that a corporation, like an individual, may ratify and thereby
render binding upon it the originally unauthorized acts of its officers or
other agents.<a style="" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">70</span></span></a>
This is true because the questioned investment is neither contrary to law,
morals, public order or public policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a corporate transaction or contract which is within the corporate
powers, but which is defective from a purported failure to observe in its
execution the requirement of the law that the investment must be authorized by
the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding two-thirds of the voting
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This requirement is for the
benefit of the stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stockholders for whose benefit the requirement was enacted may, therefore,
ratify the investment and its ratification by said stockholders obliterates any
defect which it may have had at the outset.<span style="">&nbsp;

the articles of incorporation, are merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the investment was for the purchase of beer
manufacturing and marketing facilities which is apparently relevant to the
corporate purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that
respondent corporation submitted the assailed investment to the stockholders
for ratification at the annual meeting of May 10, 1977 cannot be construed as
an admission that respondent corporation had committed an <i>ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></i> act, considering the common practice of
corporations of periodically submitting for the ratification of their
stockholders the acts of their directors, officers and managers.</p>

of the corporation's business and is of practical advantage to it, is one in
which the corporation has an interest or a reasonable expectancy, and by
embracing the opportunity, the self-interest of the officer or director will be
brought into conflict with that of his corporation, the law will not permit him
to seize the opportunity for himself.<span style="">&nbsp;

betrayed, the corporation may elect to claim all of the benefits of the
transaction for itself, and the law will impress a trust in favor of the
corporation upon the property, interests and profits so acquired."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">ADVANCE SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BARREDO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I reserved the filing of a separate opinion in order to state my
own reasons for voting in favor of the validity of the amended by-laws in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regrettably, I have not yet
finished preparing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view,
however, of the joint separate opinion of Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Jr., Fernandez and Guerrero, the full text
of which has just come to my attention, and which I am afraid might produce
certain misimpressions as to the import of the decision in this case, I
consider it urgent to clarify my position in respect to the rights of the
parties resulting from the dismissal of the petition herein and the outlining
of the procedure by which the disqualification of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> can be made effective, hence this advance
separate opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, inasmuch as petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span>
himself placed the issue of the validity of said amended by-laws squarely
before the Court for resolution, because he feels, rightly or wrongly, he can
no longer have due process or justice from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and the private respondents have joined with him in that respect,
the six votes cast by Justices <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio,
Santos, <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, de Castro and this writer in
favor of validity of the amended by-laws in question, with only four members of
this Court, namely, Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Jr., Fernandez and Guerrero opining otherwise,
and with Chief Justice Castro and Justice Fernando reserving their votes
thereon, and Justices <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Herrera not voting, thereby resulting in the dismissal of the petition
"insofar as it assails the validity of the amended by-laws . . . for lack
of necessary votes,” has no other legal consequence than that it is the law of
the case as far as the parties herein are concerned, albeit the majority
opinion of six against four Justices is not doctrinal in the sense that it
cannot be cited as necessarily a precedent for subsequent cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> and the respondents, including the Securities and
Exchange Commission, are bound by the foregoing result, namely, that the Court <u>en
banc</u> has not found merit in the claim that the amended by-laws in question
are invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is one thing to
say that dismissal of the case is not doctrinal and entirely another thing to
maintain that such dismissal leaves the issue unsettled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is somewhat of a misreading and
misconstruction of Section II of Rule 56, contrary to the well-known established
norm observed by this Court, to state that the dismissal of a petition for lack
of the necessary votes does not amount to a decision on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably, the Court is deemed to find
no merit in a petition in two ways, namely, (1) when eight or more members vote
expressly in that sense and (2) when the required number of justices needed to
sustain the same cannot be had.</p>

<p class="BODY">I reiterate, therefore, that as between the parties herein, the
issue of validity of the challenged by-laws is already settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From which it follows that the same are
already enforceable insofar as they are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span>
may not hereafter act on the assumption that he can revive the issue of
validity whether in the Securities and Exchange Commission, in this Court or in
any other forum, unless he proceeds on the basis of a factual milieu different
from the setting of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even
the Securities and Exchange Commission may pass on such question anymore at the
instance of herein petitioner or anyone acting in his stead or on his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vote of four justices to remand the case
thereto cannot alter the situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is very clear that under the decision herein, the issue of
validity is a settled matter for the parties herein as the law of the case, and
it is only the actual implementation of the impugned amended by-laws in the
particular case of petitioner that remains to be passed upon by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and on appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to
Us, assuming the board of directors of San Miguel Corporation should, after the
proper hearing, disqualify him.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the record is replete with substantial indications,
nay admissions of petitioner himself, that he is a controlling stockholder of
corporations which are competitors of San Miguel Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very substantial areas of such
competition involving hundreds of millions of pesos worth of businesses stand <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> in the records hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioner has even offered, if he
should be elected, as director, not to take part when the board takes up matters
affecting the corresponding areas of competition between his corporations and
San Miguel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, perhaps, it is
best that such evidence be formally offered at the hearing contemplated in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether or not petitioner may sit in the board, if he wins,
definitely, under the decision in this case, even if petitioner should win, he
will have to immediately leave his position or should be ousted, the moment
this Court settles the issue of his actual disqualification, either in a full blown
decision or by denying the petition for review of corresponding decision of the
Securities and Exchange Commission unfavorable to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, of course, as a matter of principle, it
is to be expected that the matter of his disqualification should be resolved
expeditiously and within the shortest possible time, so as to avoid as much
juridical injury as possible, considering that the matter of the validity of
the prohibition against competitors embodied in the amended by-laws is already
unquestionable among the parties herein and to allow him to be in the board for
sometime would create an obviously anomalous and legally incongruous situation
that should not be tolerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, all
the parties concerned must act promptly and expeditiously.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, my reservation to explain my vote on the validity
of the amended by-laws still stands.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SUPPLEMENT TO JOINT SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, CONCEPCION JR., FERNANDEZ and
GUERRERO, <i>JJ</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">This supplemental opinion is issued with reference to the advance
separate opinion of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> issued by him
as to "certain misimpressions as to the import of the decision in this
case" which might be produced by our joint separate opinion of April 11,
1979 and "urgent(<span class="SpellE">ly</span>) to clarify (his) position
in respect to the rights of the parties resulting from the dismissal of the
petition herein and the outline of the procedure by which the disqualification
of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> can be made effective."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo's</span>
advance separate opinion ''that as between the parties herein, the issue of the
validity of the challenged by-laws is already settled" has, of course, no
binding effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the
Court is found on pages 59-61 of the decision of <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1979</st1:date>, penned by Mr. Justice Antonio, wherein on
the question of the validity of the amended by-laws the Court's inconclusive voting
is set forth as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro reserved his vote on the
validity of the amended by-laws</u>, pending hearing by this Court on the
applicability of section 13(5) of the Corporation Law to petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Justice Fernando reserved his vote on the validity of
subject amendment</u> to the by-laws but otherwise concurs in the result.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>“Four (4) Justices, namely, Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Jr., Fernandez and Guerrero</u> filed a
separate opinion, wherein they <u>voted against the validity of the questioned
amended by-laws</u> and that this question should properly be resolved first by
the SEC as the agency of primary jurisdiction x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated in said judgment itself, for lack of the necessary
votes, the petition, insofar as it assails the validity of the questioned
by-laws, was dismissed.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
now contends contrary to the undersigned's understanding, as stated on pages 8
and 9 of our joint separate opinion of April 11, 1979 that the legal effect of
the dismissal of the petition on the question of validity of the amended
by-laws for lack of the necessary votes simply means that "the Court has
thereby dismissed the petition which prayed that the Court by-pass the
commission and directly resolve the issue and therefore the respondent
commission may now proceed, as announced in its Order No. 450, Series of 1977,
to hear the case before it and receive <u>all relevant evidence</u> bearing on
the issue as hereinabove indicated, and resolve the <u>'unresolved and genuine
issues of fact</u>' (as per Order No. 451, Series of 1977) and the <u>issue of
legality</u> of the disputed by-laws amendment," that such dismissal
"has no other legal consequence than that it is the law of the case as far
as the parties are concerned, albeit the majority of the opinion of six against
four Justices is not doctrinal in the sense that it cannot be cited as
necessarily a precedent for subsequent cases."</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold on our part that the doctrine of the law of the case
invoked by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> has no applicability
for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our jurisprudence is quite clear that this
doctrine may be invoked only where there has been a <u>final</u> and <u>conclusive</u>
determination of an issue in the first case later invoked as the law of the
case.</p>

<blockquote>Thus, in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Olarte</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
we held that</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'Law of the case' has been defined as the opinion delivered
on <u>a former appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically,
it means that whatever is once irrevocably established as the <u>controlling
legal rule of decision</u> between the same parties in the same case continues
to be the <u>law of the case</u>, whether correct on general principles or not,
so long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the
facts of the case before the court. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

before it and that its <u>decision</u> in any given case constitutes <u>the law

judgment becomes final it is binding on all inferior courts, and hence beyond
their power and authority to alter or modify (<span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span>

<blockquote>"’The decision of this Court on that appeal by the government
from the order of dismissal, holding that said appeal did not place the
appellants, including <span class="SpellE">Absalon</span> <span class="SpellE">Bignay</span>,
in double jeopardy, signed and concurred in by six Justices as against three
dissenters headed by the Chief Justice, promulgated way back in the year 1952,
has long become the law of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may be erroneous, judged by the law on double jeopardy as recently interpreted
by this same Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even so, it may
not be disturbed and modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
recent interpretation of the law may be applied to new cases, but certainly <u>not</u>
to an <u>old</u> one <u>finally and conclusively determined</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, the majority opinion in
that appeal is now the law of the case.'" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pinuila</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of the law of the case, therefore, has no applicability
whatsoever herein insofar as the question of the validity or invalidity of the
amended by-laws is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court's judgment of April 11, 1979 clearly shows that the voting on this
question was <u>inconclusive</u> with six against four Justices and two other
Justices (the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Fernando) expressly reserving their
votes thereon, and Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> while taking no
part in effect likewise expressly reserved his vote thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No final and conclusive determination could
be reached on the issue and pursuant to the provisions of Rule 56, section 11,
since this special civil action originally commenced in this Court, the action
was simply dismissed with the result that <u>no law of the case</u> was laid
down insofar as the issue of the validity or invalidity of the questioned
by-laws is concerned, and the <u>relief</u> sought herein by petitioner that
this Court by-pass the SEC which has yet to hear and determine the same issue
pending before it below and that this Court itself directly resolve the said
issue <u>stands denied</u>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contention of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> that the result of the dismissal of the case was
that "petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> may not hereafter act
on the assumption that he can revive the issue of the validity whether in the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in this Court or in any other forum, unless
he proceeds on the basis of a factual milieu different from the setting of this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even the Securities and
Exchange Commission may pass on such question anymore at the instance of herein
petitioner or anyone acting in his stead or on his behalf," appears to us
to be untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court through the decision of April 11, 1979, by the
unanimous votes of the twelve participating Justices headed by the Chief
Justice, ruled that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> was entitled
to a "new and proper hearing" by the SMC board of directors on the
matter of his disqualification under the questioned by-laws and that the board's
"decision shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the respondent
Securities and Exchange Commission deliberating and acting <u>en banc</u> and
ultimately to this Court (and) unless disqualified in the manner herein
provided, the prohibition in the aforementioned amended by-laws <u>shall not
apply</u> to petitioner."</p>

<p class="BODY">The entire Court, therefore, recognized that petitioner had not
been given procedural due process by the SMC board on the matter of his
disqualification and that he was entitled to a "new and proper hearing."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands to reason that in such hearing,
petitioner could raise not only questions of <u>fact</u> but questions of <u>law</u>,
particularly questions of law affecting the investing public and their right to
representation on the board as provided by law - not to mention that as borne
out by the fact that no restriction whatsoever appears in the Court's decision,
it was never contemplated that petitioner was to be limited to questions of
fact and could not raise the fundamental questions of law bearing on the
invalidity of the questioned amended by-laws at such hearing before the SMC
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it was expressly
provided unanimously in the Court's decision that the SMC board's decision on
the disqualification of petitioner ("assuming the board of directors of
San Miguel Corporation should, after the proper hearing, disqualify him"
as qualified in Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo's</span> own separate
opinion, at page 2) shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to respondent
Securities and Exchange Commission "deliberating and acting <u>en banc</u>"
and "ultimately to this Court."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the Court's judgment as set forth in its decision of April 11,
1979 contains nothing that would warrant the opinion now expressed that
respondent Securities and Exchange Commission may not pass anymore on the
question of the invalidity of the amended by-laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, it cannot be contended that the
Court in dismissing the petition for lack of necessary votes actually by-passed
the Securities and Exchange Commission and directly ruled itself on the
invalidity of the questioned by-laws when it itself could not reach a final and
conclusive vote (a minimum of eight votes) on the issue and three other
Justices (the Chief Justice and Messrs. Justices Fernando and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>) had expressly reserved their vote until after
further hearings (first before the Securities and Exchange Commission and
ultimately in this Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a view espoused by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
could conceivably result in an incongruous situation where supposedly under the
law of this case the questioned by-laws would be held valid as against
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> and yet the same may be stricken
off as invalid as to all other SMC shareholders in a proper case.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It need only be pointed out that Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo's</span> advance separate opinion can in no way affect or
modify the judgment of this Court as set forth in the decision of <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1979</st1:date> and discussed
hereinabove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same bears the
unqualified concurrence of only three Justices out of the six Justices who
originally voted for the validity <u>per se</u> of the questioned by-laws
namely, Messrs. Justices Antonio, Santos and De Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Messrs. Justices Fernando and <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> did not concur therein but they instead concurred
with the limited concurrence of the Chief Justice touching on the law of the
case which guardedly held that the Court has not found merit in the claim that
the amended by-laws in question are invalid but <u>without</u> in any manner <u>foreclosing</u>
the issue and as a matter of fact and law, <u>without</u> in any manner <u>changing
or modifying</u> the above-quoted vote of the Chief Justice as officially
rendered in the decision of April 11, 1979, wherein he precisely "<u>reserved
</u>(<u>his) vote on the validity of the amended by-laws</u>."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A word on the separate opinion of Mr. Justice
<span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> de Castro attached to the advance separate
opinion of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice De Castro advances his
interpretation as to a restrictive construction of section 13(5) of the
Philippine Corporation Law, ignoring or disregarding the fact that during the
Court's deliberations it was brought out that this prohibitory provision was
and is <u>not</u> raised in issue in this case whether here or in the Securities
and Exchange Commission below (outside of a passing argument by Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Angara</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abello</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> &amp; Cruz, as
counsels for respondent <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span> in their Memorandum
of June 26, 1978 that "(T)he disputed By-Laws does not prohibit petitioner
from holding onto, or even increasing his SMC investment; it only restricts any
shifting on the part of petitioner from passive investor to a director of the
company."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, the Court abandoned the idea of calling for
another hearing wherein the parties could properly raise and discuss this
question as a new issue and instead rendered the decision in question, under
which the question of section 13(5) could be raised at a new and proper hearing
before the SMC board and in the Securities and Exchange Commission and in due
course before this Court (but with the clear understanding that since both
corporations, the <span class="SpellE">Robina</span> and SMC are engaged in
agriculture as submitted by the <span class="SpellE">Sorianos</span>' counsel in
their said memorandum, the issue could be raised likewise against SMC and its
other shareholders, directors, if not against SMC itself).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As expressly stated in the Chief Justice's
reservation of his vote, the matter of the question of the applicability of the
said section 13(5) to petitioner would be heard by this Court at the
appropriate time after the proceedings below (and necessarily the question of
the validity of the amended by-laws would be taken up anew and the Court would
at that time be able to reach a final and conclusive vote).</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Justice De Castro's personal interpretation of the decision
of April 11, 1979 that petitioner may be allowed to run for election despite
adverse decision of both the SMC board and the Securities and Exchange
Commission "only if he comes to this Court and obtains an injunction
against the enforcement of the decision disqualifying him" is patently
contradictory of his vote on the matter as expressly given in the judgment in
the Court's decision of April 11, 1979 (at page 59) that petitioner could run
and if elected, sit as director of the respondent SMC and could be disqualified
<u>only</u> after a "new and proper hearing by the board of directors of
said corporation, whose decision shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the respondent Securities and Exchange Commission deliberating and acting <u>en
banc</u> and ultimately to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unless disqualified in the manner herein provided, the prohibition in
the aforementioned amended by-laws shall not apply to petitioner."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the decision penned by Justice Antonio, I voted to
uphold the validity of the amendment to the by-laws in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What induced me to this view is the practical
consideration easily perceived in the following illustration:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a person becomes a stockholder of a
corporation and gets himself elected as a director, and while he is such a
director, he forms his own corporation competitive or antagonistic to the corporation
of which he is a director, and becomes Chairman of the Board and President of
his own corporation, he may be removed from his position as director,
admittedly one of trust and confidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If this is so, as seems <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> to be the
case, a person already controlling, and also the Chairman of the Board and
President of, a corporation, may be barred from becoming a member of the board
of directors of a competitive corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is my view, even as I am for a restrictive interpretation of Section
13(5) of the Philippine Corporation Law, under which I would limit the scope of
the provision to corporations engaged in agricultural, but only as the word
"agriculture" refers to <span class="GramE">its</span> more limited
meaning as distinguished from its general and broad connotation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term would then mean "farming"
or raising the natural products of the soil, such as by cultivation, in the
manner as is required by the Public Land Act in the acquisition of agricultural
land, such as by homestead, before the patent may be issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is my opinion that under the public land
statute, the development of a certain portion of the land applied for as
specified in the law as a condition precedent before the applicant may obtain a
<span class="GramE">patent,</span> is cultivation, not let us say, poultry raising
or piggery, which may be included in the term "agriculture" in its
broad sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For under Section 13(5) of
the Philippine Corporation Law, construed not in the strict way as I believe it
should, because the provision is in derogation of property rights, the
petitioner in this case would be disqualified from becoming an officer of
either the San Miguel Corporation or his own supposedly agricultural
corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus beyond my
comprehension why, feeling as though I am the only member of the Court for a
restricted interpretation of Section 13(5) of Act 1459, doubt still seems to be
in the minds of other members giving the cited provision an unrestricted
interpretation, as to the validity of the amended by-laws in question, or even
holding them null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the observation of Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
that despite that less than six votes are for upholding the validity of the
by-laws, their validity is deemed upheld, as constituting the "law of the
case."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not be otherwise,
after the present petition is dismissed with the relief sought to declare null
and void the said by-laws being denied in effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A vicious circle would be created if, should
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> be barred or disqualified from
running by the Board of Directors of San Miguel Corporation and the Securities
and Exchange Commission sustain the Board, petitioner could come again to Us,
raising the same question he has raised in the present petition, unless the
principle of the "law of the case" is applied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clarifying therefore, my position, I am of the opinion that with
the validity of the by-laws in question standing unimpaired, it is now for
petitioner to show that he does not come within the disqualification as therein
provided, both to the Board and later to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it being a foregone conclusion that, unless petitioner disposes of
his stockholdings in the so-called competitive corporations, San Miguel
Corporation would apply the by-laws against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His right, therefore, to run depends on what,
on election day, May 8, 1979, the ruling of the Board and/or the Securities and
Exchange Commission on his qualification to run would be, certainly, not the
final ruling of this Court in the event recourse thereto is made by the party
feeling aggrieved, as intimated in the "Joint Separate Opinion" of
Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
Jr., Fernandez and Guerrero, that only after petitioner’s
"disqualification" has ultimately been passed upon by this Court
should petitioner not be allowed to run.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner may be allowed to run, despite an adverse decision of both
the Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, only if he comes to this
Court and obtain an injunction against the enforcement of the decision
disqualifying him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such injunction
being required, <span class="GramE">all that</span> petitioner has to do is to
take his time in coming to this Court, and in so doing, he would in the
meantime, be allowed to run, and if he wins, to sit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would, however, be contrary to the
doctrine that gives binding, if not conclusive, effect of findings of facts of
administrative bodies exercising quasi-judicial functions upon appellate
courts, which should, accordingly, be enforced until reversed by this Tribunal.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">JOINT SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, CONCEPCION JR., FERNANDEZ and
GUERRERO, <i>JJ</i>.:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly stated in the main opinion of Mr. Justice Antonio,
the Court is unanimous in its judgment granting the petitioner as stockholder
of respondent San Miguel Corporation the right to inspect, examine and secure
copies of the records of San Miguel International, Inc. (SMI), a wholly owned
foreign subsidiary corporation of respondent San Miguel Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent commission's <u>en banc</u> Order
No. 449, Series of 1977, denying petitioner's right of inspection for "not
being a stockholder of San Miguel International, Inc." has been
accordingly set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It need be only
pointed out that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The commission's reasoning grossly disregards
the fact that the stockholders of San Miguel Corporation are likewise the
owners of San Miguel International, Inc. as the corporation's wholly owned
foreign subsidiary and therefore have every right to have access to its books
and records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the directors
and management of any Philippine corporation by the simple device of organizing
with the corporation's funds foreign subsidiaries would be granted complete
immunity from the stockholders' scrutiny of its foreign operations and would
have a conduit for dissipating, if not misappropriating, the corporate funds
and assets by merely channeling them into foreign subsidiaries' operations; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's right of examination herein
recognized refers to all books and records of the foreign subsidiary SMI which
are "in respondent corporation's possession and control"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
meaning to say regardless of whether or not such books and records are
physically within the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
such books and records of SMI are legally within respondent corporation's
"possession and control" and if any books or records are kept abroad,
(e.g. in the foreign subsidiary's state of domicile, as is to be expected),
then the respondent corporation's board and management are obliged under the
Court's judgment to bring and make them (or true copies thereof) available within
the Philippines for petitioner's examination and inspection.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other main issue of the validity of respondent San Miguel
Corporation's amendment of its by-laws<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
whereby respondent corporation's board of directors under its resolution dated
April 29, 1977 declared petitioner ineligible to be nominated or to be voted or
to be elected as member of the board of directors, the Court, composed of 12
members (since Mme. Justice <span class="SpellE">Ameurfina</span> <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Herrera inhibited herself from taking part herein,
while Mr. Justice Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> upon submittal of
the main opinion of Mr. Justice Antonio decided not to take part), failed to
reach a conclusive vote or the required majority of 8 votes to settle the issue
one way or the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Six members of the Court, namely, Justices <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, Antonio, Santos, <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos and De Castro, considered the issue purely legal and voted to sustain
the validity <u>per se</u> of the questioned amended by-laws but nevertheless
voted that the prohibition and disqualification therein provided shall <u>not</u>
apply to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> <u>until and after</u>
he shall have been given "a new and proper hearing" by the
corporation's board of directors and the board's decision of disqualification
shall have been sustained on appeal by respondent Securities and Exchange
Commission and ultimately by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undersigned Justices do not consider the issue as purely
legal in the light of respondent commission's Order No. 451, Series of 1977,
denying petitioner's "Motion for Summary Judgment" on the ground that
"the Commission <u>en banc</u> finds that there (are) unresolved and
genuine issues of fact"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as its position in this case thru the Solicitor General that the case
at bar is "premature" and that the administrative remedies before the
commission should first be availed of and exhausted.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the opinion that the questioned amended by-laws, as
they are, (adopted after almost a century of respondent corporation's existence
as a public corporation with its shares freely purchased and traded in the open
market without restriction and disqualification) which would bar petitioner
from qualification, nomination and election as director and worse, grant the
board by 3/4 vote the arbitrary power to bar any stockholder from his right to
be elected as director by the simple expedient of declaring him to be engaged
in a "competitive or antagonistic business" or declaring him as a
"nominee" of the "competitive or antagonistic" stockholder
are illegal, oppressive, arbitrary and unreasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We consider the questioned amended by-laws as being specifically
tailored to discriminate against petitioner and depriving him in violation of
substantive due process of his vested substantial rights as stockholder of
respondent corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We further
consider said amended by-laws as violating specific provisions of the
Corporation Law which grant and recognize the right of a minority stockholder
like petitioner to be elected director by the process of cumulative voting
ordained by the Law (<span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 21 and 30) and the right
of a minority director once elected not to be removed from office of director
except <u>for cause</u> by vote of the stockholders holding 2/3 of the
subscribed capital stock (sec. 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a
minority stockholder could be <u>disqualified</u> by such a by-laws amendment
under the guise of providing for "qualifications", these mandates of
the Corporation Law would have no meaning or purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">These vested and substantial rights granted stockholders under
the Corporations Law may not be diluted or defeated by the general authority
granted by the Corporation Law itself to corporations to adopt their by-laws
(in section 21) which deal principally with the procedures governing their
internal business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The by-laws of any
corporation must be always within the charter limits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Corporation Law has granted
stockholders may <u>not</u> be taken away by the corporation's by-laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amendment is further an instrument of
oppressiveness and arbitrariness in that the incumbent directors are thereby
enabled to perpetuate themselves in office by the simple expedient of
disqualifying any unwelcome candidate, no matter how many votes he may have.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in view of the inconclusiveness of the vote, we sustain
respondent commission's stand as expressed in its Orders Nos. 450 and 451,
Series of 1977 that there are "unresolved and genuine issues of fact"
and that it has yet to rule on and finally decide the validity of the disputed
by-law provision", subject to appeal by either party to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of <span class="SpellE">prematurity</span> of the
proceedings here (as likewise expressed by Mr. Justice Fernando), the case
should as a consequence be remanded to the Securities and Exchange Commission
as the agency of primary jurisdiction for a full hearing and reception of
evidence of all relevant facts (which should properly be submitted to the commission
instead of the piecemeal documents submitted as annexes to this Court which is
not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of facts) concerning not only the
petitioner but the members of the board of directors of respondent corporation
as well, so that it may determine on the basis thereof the issue of the legality
of the questioned amended by-laws, and assuming that it holds the same to be
valid whether the same are arbitrarily and unreasonably applied to petitioner <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u></span><u> a <span class="SpellE">vis</span></u> other
directors, who, petitioner claims, should in such event be likewise
disqualified from sitting in the board of directors by virtue of conflict of
interests or their being likewise engaged in "competitive or antagonistic
business" with the corporation such as investment and finance, coconut oil
mills, cement, milk and hotels.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that while the petition may be dismissed in
view of the inconclusiveness of the vote and the Court's failure to attain the
required 8-vote majority to resolve the issue, such a dismissal (for lack of
necessary votes) is of no doctrinal value and does not in any manner resolve
the issue of the validity of the questioned amended by-laws nor foreclose the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same should properly be
determined in a proper case in the first instance by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as the agency of primary jurisdiction, as above indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is unanimous, therefore, in its judgment that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gokongwei</span> may run for the office of, and
if elected, sit as, member of the board of directors of respondent San Miguel
Corporation as stated in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the main opinion of Mr. Justice Antonio, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Until and after</u> petitioner has been
given a "new and proper hearing by the board of directors of said
corporation, whose decision shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to
the respondent Securities and Exchange Commission deliberating and acting <u>en
banc</u> and ultimately to this Court" and until "disqualified in the
manner herein provided, the prohibition in the aforementioned amended by-laws
shall not apply to petitioner."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, <u>until and after</u> petitioner shall have been given due
process and proper hearing by the respondent board of directors as to the
question of his qualification or disqualification under the questioned amended
by-laws (assuming that the respondent Securities and Exchange Commission
ultimately upholds the validity of said by-laws), and such disqualification
shall have been sustained by respondent Securities and Exchange Commission and
ultimately by final judgment of this Court, petitioner is deemed eligible for
all legal purposes and effects to be nominated and voted and if elected to sit
as a member of the board of directors of respondent San Miguel Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the Court's unanimous judgment on this point, the
portion of respondent commission's Order No. 450, Series of 1977 which imposed
"the condition that he [petitioner] cannot sit as board member if elected
until after the Commission shall have finally decided the validity of the
disputed by-law provision" has been likewise accordingly set aside.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="BODY">By way of recapitulation, so that the Court's decision and
judgment may be clear and not subject to ambiguity, we state the following:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the votes of the six Justices concurring
unqualifiedly in the main opinion added to our four votes, plus the Chief
Justice's vote and that of Mr. Justice Fernando, the Court has by twelve (12)
votes unanimously rendered judgment granting petitioner's right to examine and
secure copies of the books and records of San Miguel International, Inc. as a
foreign subsidiary of respondent corporation and respondent commission's Order
No. 449, Series of 1977, to the contrary is set aside;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the same twelve (12) votes, the Court
has also unanimously rendered judgment declaring that <u>until and after</u>
petitioner shall have been given due process and proper hearing by the
respondent board of directors as to the question of his disqualifications under
the questioned amended by-laws (assuming that the respondent Securities and
Exchange Commission ultimately upholds the validity of said by-laws), and such
disqualification shall have been sustained by respondent Securities and
Exchange Commission and ultimately by final judgment of this Court, petitioner
is deemed eligible for all legal purposes and effects to be nominated and voted
and if elected to sit as a member of the board of directors of respondent San
Miguel Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
respondent commission's Order No. 450, Series of 1977 to the contrary has
likewise been set aside; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court's voting on the validity of
respondent corporation's amendment of the by-laws (sec. 2, Art. III) is
inconclusive without the required majority of eight votes to settle the issue
one way or the other having been reached.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No judgment is rendered by the Court thereon and the statements of the
six Justices who have signed the main opinion on the legality thereof have no
binding effect, much less doctrinal value.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of the petition insofar as the question of the validity
of the disputed by-laws amendment is concerned is not by any judgment with the
required eight votes but simply by force of Rule 56, section 11 of the Rules of
Court, the pertinent portion of which provides that "where the court <u>en
banc</u> is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be
had, the case shall be reheard, and if on re-hearing no decision is reached,
the action shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the court x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." The end result is that
the Court has thereby dismissed the petition which prayed that the Court
by-pass the commission and directly resolve the issue and therefore the
respondent commission may now proceed, as announced in its Order No. 450, Series
of 1977, to hear the case before it and receive all relevant evidence bearing
on the issue as herein-above indicated, and resolve the "unresolved and
genuine issues of fact” (as per Order No. 451, series of 1977) and the issues
of legality of the disputed by-laws amendment.</p>
