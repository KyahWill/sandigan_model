Palma of the Court of First <span style="">Instance </span>of

executrix and the residuary heirs of the deceased, Maxima Santos <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span style="">de <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>, </span>and adjudicating to the respective parties
therein mentioned the properties both real and persons <span style="">as </span>therein proposed, insofar as the share of one of the heirs <span style="">Marvin S. </span><span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>,
was awarded to <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
peti<span style="">tioner claiming that he had
previously acquired the same in a sale by public auction, by virtue of </span>a
<span style="">writ of execution issued by the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, is challenged in this
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons to be expressed more
fully the above order of August 31, 1964, denying the petition "without
prejudice to any other action which [petitioner] may take on the matter as
against Marvin S. <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>," which, as noted, was
not properly to be ventilated in the testate pro­ceeding, is sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
brief of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> B. Flores, as appellant,
the antecedents of his petition were narrated thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="6"><span style="">June 11, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the executrix (one of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein) and the residuary heirs of the aforesaid
deceased presented </span>the court below a second partial project of partition
* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said project of partition, the
hereditary rights of the heir Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> (also an
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein), including his 2/80 share in the
property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 42372 of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, were adjudicated in favor of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> (an <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
herein) to wham the said hereditary had allegedly been sold and assigned by
Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court approved the second partial project of partition in its
order dated <st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1964</st1:date> *
* *."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then came a statement of his claim:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"On July 3, 1964, appellant filed a verified petition * * * to set
aside the said order of June 15, 1964, alleging other things that he is the
purchaser of the 2/80 share of Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> in the
property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 42372 in a sate at public
auction made by the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on
February 12, 1964 in pursuance of the writ of execution issued by the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in Civil Case No. 2222
entitled '<span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> B. Flores vs. Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>’: that he was not notified of the hearing of the
second partial project of partition although the executrix had been duly
informed of the aforesaid auction sale: and that the adjudication of the said
2/80 share of Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> is contrary to
the provisions of Section 9, Rule 57, of the new Rules of Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
He would pray, therefore, "that the order of June 15, 1964, he set aside
insofar as it adjudicates to <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> the said 2/80 share in the property in question and
that the same be delivered instead to the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, subject to the right of redemption by the judgment
debtor or by any <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> within the period
provided by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The opposition of the executrix was set forth in the brief of
petitioner as appellant thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Under date of July 16, 1964, the executrix filed an opposition * *
* claiming validity of the adjudication of the 2/80 share of Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> in the property in favor of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> because all tile rights, interests and
participation of said heir in the estate of the deceased had already been sold
and assigned to said <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
way back on December 15, 1962: that appellant <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
B. Flores acquired nothing by virtue of the alleged sale at public auction
inasmuch as Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> had no more right or
interest in the said property when the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
attached and sold at public auction the said property; and that the said
adjudication is proper, legal and justified especially so when the same was
made principally upon agreement of the residuary heir Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After which came a reply from petitioner "stating that he is a purchaser
in good faith and for value of the 2/80 share of Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
in the property in question because at the time of the sale he had no knowledge
or information concerning the assignment thereof in favor of <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Parcual</span>; that no
third-party claim was filed with the sheriff by either <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> or the executrix; that before taking part
in the auction sale, he investigated the status of Transfer of Certificate of
Title No. 42372 and found the same to be free from any liens and encumbrances;
and that he is not bound and cannot be prejudiced by a support prior assignment
made to <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
of the rights and interests of Marvin <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> in the
property inasmuch as the sale of tie same property in his favor has been duly
register and annotated at the back of the title thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As noted, the lower court
denied, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8"><span style="">August 31, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the petition to </span>set <span style="">aside its order of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="15" month="6"><span style="">June 15,
 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal, in view of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">controlling legal principle cannot, as already indicated, succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner would assail
the adjudication of the rights </span>mid <span style="">interests
of the heir, Marvin S. <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>, in the aforesaid 2/80
undivided portion of the property embraced in TCT No. 42372 in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> as being contrary to a specific provision of the
Rules of Court: "The attachment of the interest of an heir, legatee, or
devisee in the property belonging to the estate of a decedent, shall not impair
the powers of the executor, administrator, or other personal representative, of
the decedent over such property for the purpose of administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such personal representative, however, shall
report the attachment to the court when petition for distribution it filed, and
in the order made upon such petition, distribution may be awarded to such heir,
legatee, or devisee, but the property attached shall be ordered delivered to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">officer making the levy, subject to the claim of such heir, legatee, or
devisee, or any person claiming under him."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner apparently
lost sight of or even more specify prevision found in an earlier section of the
same Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "Properties shall
he attached by the officer executing the </span>order in the following
manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * The interest of the party
against whom attachment is issued in property belonging to the estate of the
decedent, whether as heir, legatee, or devisee, by serving the executor or
administrator or other personal representative of the decedent with a copy of
the order and notice that said interest is attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of said order of attachment and of
said notice shall also be file in the office of the clerk of court in which
said estate is being settled and served upon the heir, legatee or devisee
concerned." The second paragraph is particularly pertinent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If the property sought to be attached
is in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>,
copy of the order of attachment shall be filed with the proper court and notice
of the attachment served upon the custodian of such property."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
As authoritatively commented upon by former Chief Justice Moran: "Taken
from sub-section (f) of section 7 of former Rule 59, which was based on rulings
<span class="GramE">laid</span> down by the Supreme Court and was in conformity
with American Jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A further
proviso has been added to the effect that if the property sought to be attached
is in <span class="SpellE">custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">legis</span>, a
copy of the writ shall be filed with the proper court and notice of the
attachment served upon the custodian of such property."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner in this case, having failed to comply with the above
requirement of the Rules of Court, cannot be heard to complain if such an order
of adjudication in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="GramE">were</span> made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The validity of such order by Judge <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma cannot be successfully impugned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reliance can be had on the writ of
execution issued by another court of first instance to affect a property
forming part of an estate still in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> the procedure required by law not having been
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot escape attention
that in the challenged order the rights of petitioner as against the heir were
safeguarded, but certainly, under the circumstances, what was done by it as a
probate court cannot by this petition be undone.</p>

<p class="BODY">The brief for petitioner as appellant assigned as the first two
errors the failure of the lower court to consider him a purchaser for value of
the rights and interests of Marvin S. <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> in the
property now the object of this proceeding and that au such his having "a
better right * * *as against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, who is a
prior assignee thereof [but] whose assignment is not recorded in the title of
the property." The last two alleged errors would find fault in the
adjudication of the aforesaid share of Marvin S. <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> instead of awarding it to such heir, but
ordering its delivery to the Sheriff subject to the claim of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no need to discuss any of the above
errors in view of what has been set forth, which renders clear and indisputable
that, in accordance with the facts before the lower court and the procedural
rules that call for application, the order assailed cannot be shown to be
illegal.</p>
