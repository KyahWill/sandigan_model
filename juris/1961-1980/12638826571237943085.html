Branch) in Special Proceedings No. 812, Testate Estate of the Late Gregorio
Ventura, on February 26, 1964 and June 11, 1964 granting the motion of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Mercedes Ventura to annul the institution of heirs
made in the will of the deceased, which was probated during his lifetime, upon
the ground that said <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and her sister <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> Ventura who have been found in the decision of
another court in a corresponding case, already final, to be legitimate children
and compulsory heirs of said deceased, were <span class="SpellE">preterited</span>
and deprived of their share in the inheritance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant denies that the decision referred to has already become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1952" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1952</st1:date>,
herein <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
Ventura filed an action in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, Branch I, against the other <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein Mercedes Ventura, who later joined cause
with <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>, and Gregorio Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> and
Mercedes claimed that they are the legitimate children of Gregorio Ventura and
his wife <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span>,
who died in 1943, and asked that one-half of the properties described in the
complaint be declared as the share of their mother in the conjugal partnership,
with them as the only forced heirs of their mother <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 1064.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later on, the same properties invoked in the just mentioned case
became the subject of another action, Civil Case No. 1476, also of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
Branch I, filed by <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eufracia</span>
and Juliana, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span>, against
Gregorio Ventura and the two sisters, Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that as the only children of
Modesto <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span>, sole brother of <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span>, they, instead of Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>,
whom they claimed are adulterous children of <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span>
with another man, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Ventura, and as such are
not entitled to inherit from her under the Old Civil Code, are the ones who
should be declared as inheritors of the share of <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span>
in the conjugal partnership with Gregorio.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the above complaints, Gregorio Ventura took the
position that Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> are not his
children because they were born out of the adulterous relationship between <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> who had left their conjugal home and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Ventura with whom she lived for more than ten
years.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 1064, Gregorio Ventura filed a counterclaim
against Mercedes and her husband, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>,
seeking the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> from them of properties
covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. <span class="GramE">T-1102,
T-1212, T-1213 and T-1214 of the Office of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1953" day="14" month="12">December
 14, 1953</st1:date>, Gregorio Ventura filed a petition for the probate of his
will and thus gave rise to herein subject proceeding, Special Proceedings No.
812.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In due course, said will was
admitted to probate on <st1:date year="1954" day="14" month="1">January 14,

final.</p>

executrix, in which capacity, she is appellant in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1959</st1:date>,
after a joint hearing of Civil Cases Nos. 1064 and 1476, the court rendered its
decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Mercedes

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon motion for reconsideration, this

Mercedes and her husband to P97<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This motion was opposed first, by Miguel Ventura and Juana
Cardona, who were given shares in the will of Gregorio, and later by appellant
Maria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main ground of this latter
opposition was that the decision in Civil Cases Nos. 1064 and 1476 was not yet
final, notwithstanding the dismissal of her appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She contended that since the action filed by
Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> was for partition, the decision
of the court of November 4, 1959, which merely "urged" the parties
"to arrive at an amicable settlement of the properties herein adjudicated
within twenty days from receipt of this decision," and "upon their
failure to do so, the Court shall appoint commissioners to divide the
properties in accordance with the terms of this decision" left something
else to be done and was, therefore, interlocutory and not final, citing 1
Moran, Rules of Court, 1950 ed. 810 and the cases therein cited.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1964</st1:date>,

Atty. <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Garampil</span>,
filed an opposition contending that "there is no basis in alleging that
the appeal (in this case) has become moot and academic" just because the
partition in Civil Cases Nos. 1064 and 1476 has already been done with approval
of the court which has not been appealed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But <span class="GramE">We</span> find this posture of appellant
inconsistent with the position taken by her in the court below in her motion
for reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="2">February
 26, 1964</st1:date>, where she stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Is the decision of the Court in Civil Cases Nos. 1064 and
1476 dated <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1959</st1:date>,
as amended, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which is
quoted above, already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If it is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
then the findings of the Court 'declaring Mercedes Ventura and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> Ventura to be the legitimate daughters of <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span> and Gregorio
Ventura' is already an established fact, and, therefore, Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> may properly ask for the annulment of the
institution of heirs in the will, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">D-1,</span> and this Court would be correct in annulling the
institution of heirs in the will <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D-1 for 'the
compulsory heirs Mercedes Ventura and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
Ventura, legitimate children of the deceased Gregorio Ventura and <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span>, are indeed <span class="SpellE">preterited</span>' (order under reconsideration).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, if said decision of November 4, 1959 is
not yet final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, or if it is merely
interlocutory, because there is something more to be done for the complete disposition
of the case, that is, the making of the partition by the duly appointed three
(3) commissioners, and the action of the court upon such report, and that the
order or judgment of the court approving such report is the final order or
judgment, it follows that the findings of the court 'declaring Mercedes Ventura
and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> Ventura to be the legitimate daughters
of <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span> and
Gregorio Ventura', is interlocutory and not final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The executrix shall appeal said decision of <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1959</st1:date> in due time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If said decision of <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="11">November
 4, 1959</st1:date> is not as yet final, it is, therefore, premature for this
Court to order the annulment of the institution of heirs in the will <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D-1, on the ground that said Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> were <span class="SpellE">preterited</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If when we shall appeal said decision of
November 4, 1959 and surely we shall appeal and that if the higher court shall
find Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> to be the adulterous
children of <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span>
and her paramour <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Ventura, as contended by
Gregorio Ventura, then Mercedes and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> are
foreigners to Gregorio Ventura, they are not his daughters, and consequently
they could not be said to be '<span class="SpellE">preterited</span>' in Gregorio
Ventura's will, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D-1, and clearly the order of
this Court dated <st1:date year="1964" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1964</st1:date>,
is manifestly premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us wait for
the finality of the decision of <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="11">November
 4, 1959</st1:date> entered in Cases Nos. 1064 and 1476." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 38-40, Rec. on Appeal.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And so, acting on <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' motion to
dismiss appeal, it is Our considered opinion that the decision in Civil Cases
Nos. 1064 and 1476 declaring that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Mercedes
and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> Ventura are the legitimate children of
the deceased Gregorio Ventura and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Simpliciano</span>, and as such are entitled to the annulment of
the institution of heirs made in the probated will of said deceased became
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon the finality of the order
approving the partition directed in the decision in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We need not indulge in any discussion as to
whether or not, as of the time the orders here in question were issued by the
trial court said decision had the nature of an interlocutory order only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, in the case of Miranda,
aforementioned, the opinion of the majority of the Court may well be invoked
against appellant's pose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event,
even if the Court were minded to modify again Miranda and go back to <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zaldariaga</span>, - and
it is not, as of now – there can be no question that the approval by the trial
court in Civil Cases Nos. 1064 and 1476 of the partition report of the
commissioners appointed for the purpose, one of whom, Emmanuel Mariano, is the
husband of appellant, put a definite end to those cases, leaving nothing else
to be done in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
order of approval is an <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> one, and inasmuch
as no appeal has been taken from the same, it is beyond dispute that the
decision in controversy has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
in all respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the case at bar
has become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the appeal of
Executrix-Appellant Maria Ventura in this case is hereby dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs in this instance.</p>
