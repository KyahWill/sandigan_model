Reyes is omitted)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Gabino Diaz died in 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On October 20, 1964 Severa Mendoza and her two children, Andrea Diaz and
Angel Diaz, executed a deed of donation denominated as "Kasulatan ng
Pagbibigay na Magkakabisa Pagkamatay (Donation <u>Mortis</u> <u>Causa</u>)"
over one-half of Lot No. 2377-A, which is a portion of Lot No. 2377 of the
Lolomboy Friar Lands Estate (which in turn is item 3 or [c] in the 1949 deed of
donation already mentioned).</p>

<p class="BODY">In that deed of donation, Severa Mendoza donated to Andrea Diaz
her one-half share in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2377-A, which one-half share
is identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2377-A-1, on condition that Andrea
Diaz would bear the funeral expenses to be incurred after the donor's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died in 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the other one-half share in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2377-A or Lot No. 2377-A-2 was previously adjudicated to Angel Diaz because he
defrayed the funeral expenses on the occasion of the death of Gabino Diaz.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 12, 1970 Andrea Diaz sued her brother, Angel Diaz, in the
Court of First Instance of Bulacan, Sta. Maria Branch V for the partition of
Lots Nos. 2377-A and 2502 (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">SM-357).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teodorico Alejandro, the surviving spouse of
Olimpia Diaz, and their children intervened in the said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed one-third of Lot No. 2502.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angel Diaz alleged in his answer that he had
been occupying his share of Lot No. 2502 "for more than twenty
years".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intervenors claimed
that the 1949 donation was a void <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1971</st1:date>
the lower court rendered a partial decision with respect to Lot No. <u>2377-A</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was continued with respect to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
No. <u>2502</u> which is item No. 1 or (a) in the 1949 deed of donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show what happened to the
other six lots mentioned in the deed of donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in its decision of <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1971</st1:date> held that the said deed of donation was a
donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> because the ownership of the properties
donated did not pass to the donees during the donors' lifetime but was transmitted
to the donees only "upon the death of the donors".</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it sustained the division of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
No. 2502 into two equal parts between Angel Diaz and Andrea Diaz on the theory
that the said deed of donation was effective "as an extrajudicial
partition among the parents and their children''.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Alejandro intervenors were
not given any share in Lot No. 2502.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angel Diaz and the intervenorâs were ordered to pay Andrea Diaz
"attorneyâs fees of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> each or a total of
P2,000".</p>

<p class="BODY">The Alejandro intervenors filed a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1971</st1:date> the trial court denied that motion
but eliminated the attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Andrea Diaz and the AlejanÂ­dro intervenors filed separate appeals to
this Court under Republic Act No. 5440.</p>

<p class="BODY">Andrea Diaz contends that the 1949 deed of donation is a valid
donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> and that the trial court erred in deleting
the award for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Alejandro intervenors contend that the said donation is <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u>; that they are entitled to a one-third share in Lot No. 2502, and
that the trial court erred characterizing the deed as a valid partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ultimately analysis, the appeal
involves the issue of whether the Alejandro intervenors should be awarded
one-third of Lot No. 2502, or 1,892 square meters thereof, as intestate heirs
of the Diaz spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">To resolve that issue, it is necessary to determine whether the
deed of donation is <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> or <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A brief exposition on the nature of donation <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u> and <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> may facilitate the resolution of
that issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many legal battles have been
fought on the question of whether a particular deed is an <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
or <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> donation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The copious jurisprudence on that point sheds light on that vexed
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 728.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Donations
which are to take effect upon the death of the donor partake of the nature of
testamentary provisions, and shall be governed by the rules established in the
Title on Succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(620).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 729.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
donor intends that the donation shall take effect during the lifetime of the
donor, though the property shall not be delivered till after the donor's death,
this shall be a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fruits of the property from the time of
the acceptance of the <span class="GramE">donation,</span> shall pertain to the
donee, unless the donor provides otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(n)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 730.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fixing
of an event or the imposition of a suspensive condition, which may take place
beyond the natural expectation of life of the donor, does not destroy the
nature of the act as a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>, unless a contrary
intention appears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(n)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 731.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a
person donates something subject to the resolutory condition of the donor's
survival, there is a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(n)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 732.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Donations
which are to take effect <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> shall be governed by the
general provisions on contracts and obligations in all that is not determined
in this Title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(621)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>Nature of donations inter vivos and mortis causa transfers</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> Before tackling the issues raised in this appeal, it is
necessary to have some familiarization with the distinctions between donations <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u> and <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> because the Code prescribes
different formalities for the two kinds of donations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> donation of real
property must be evidenced by a public document and should be accepted by the
donee in the same deed of donation or in a separate instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, the donor should be
notified of the acceptance in an authentic form and that step should be noted
in both instruments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 749, Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
donation of personal property, see art. 748).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, a transfer <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> should
be embodied in a last will and testament (Art. 728, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should not be called donation <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in reality a legacy
(5 <st1:city><st1:place>Manresa</st1:place></st1:city>, Codigo Civil, 6th Ed.,
p. 107).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not embodied in a valid
will, the donation is void (Narag vs. Cecilio, 109 Phil. 299; Aznar vs.
Sucilla, 102 Phil. 902; Tuason vs. Posadas, 54 Phil. 289; Serrano vs. Solomon,
105 Phil. 998, 1002).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court advised notaries to apprise donors of the necessity of
clearly specifying whether, notwithstanding the donation, they wish to retain
the right to control and dispose at will of the property before their death,
without the consent or intervention of the beneficiary, since the reservation
of such right would be a conclusive indication that the transfer would be
effective only at the donor's death, and, therefore, the formalities of
testaments should be observed; while, a <u>converso</u>, the express waiver of
the right of free disposition would place the <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
character of the donation beyond dispute (Cuevas vs. Cuevas, 98 Phil. 68, 72).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the aforequoted articles 728 to 732, it is evident that it
is the time of effectivity (aside from the form) which distinguishes a donation
<u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> from a donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the effectivity is determined by the time
when the full or naked ownership (<u>dominium</u> <u>plenum</u> or <u>dominium</u>
<u>directum</u>) of the donated properties is transmitted to the donees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See Lopez vs. Olbes, 15
Phil. 540; Gonzales and Fuster Fabra vs. Gonzales Mondragon, 35 Phil. 105).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The execution of a public instrument is a
mode of delivery or tradition (Ortiz vs. Court of Appeals, 97 Phil. 46).</p>

<p class="BODY">If the donation is made in contemplation of the donor's death,
meaning that the full or naked ownership of the donated properties will pass to
the donee only because of the donor's death, then it is at that time that the
donation takes effect, and it is a donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> which
should be embodied in a last will and testament (Bonsato vs. Court of Appeals,
95 Phil. 481).</p>

<p class="BODY">But if the donation takes effect during the donor's lifetime or
independently of the donor's death, meaning that the full or naked ownership (<u>nuda</u>
<u>proprietas</u>) of the donated properties passes to the donee during the
donor's lifetime, not by reason of his death but because of the deed of
donation, then the donation is <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> (Castro vs. Court of
Appeals, L-20122, April 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 1076).</p>

<p class="BODY">The effectivity of the donation should be ascertained from the
deed of donation and the circumstances surrounding its execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, for example, it is apparent from the
document of trust that the donee's acquisition of the property or right accrued
immediately upon the effectivity of the instrument and not upon the donor's
death, the donation is <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> (Kiene vs. Collector of
Internal Revenue, 97 Phil. 352).</p>

<p class="BODY">There used to be a prevailing notion, spawned by a study of Roman
<span class="GramE">Law</span>, that the civil Code recognizes a donation <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> as a juridical act in contraposition to a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That impression persisted because the
implications of article 620 of the Spanish Civil Code, now article 728, that
"las donaciones que hayan de producir sus efectos por muerte del donante
participan de la naturaleza de las disposiciones de ultima voluntad, y se
regirÃ¡n por las reglas establecidas en el capÃ­tulo de la sucesiÃ³n
testamentaria" had not been fully expounded in the law schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notaries assumed that the donation <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> of the Roman <span class="GramE">Law</span> was incorporated into
the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">As explained by Justice J. B. L. Reyes in the <u>Bonsato</u>
case, <u>supra</u>, article 620 broke away from the Roman <span class="GramE">Law</span>
tradition and followed the French doctrine that no one may both donate and
retain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 620 merged donations <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> with testamentary dispositions and thus suppressed the said
donations as an independent legal concept.<span style="">&nbsp;

sigue las reglas establecidas para la sucesiÃ³n testamentaria" (5
Comentarios al Codigo Civil EspaÃ±ol, 6th Ed., p. 107).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Note that the Civil Code does not use the
term donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Section 1536 of the Revised Administrative Code in imposing the
inheritance tax uses the term "gift <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>").</p>

<p class="BODY">What are the distinguishing characteristics of a donation <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Reyes in the <u>Bonsato</u>
case says that in a disposition <u>post</u> <u>mortem</u> (1) the transfer
conveys no title or ownership to the transferee before the death of the
transferor, or the transferor (meaning testator) retains the ownership, full or
naked (<u>dominio</u> <u>absoluto</u> or <u>nuda</u> <u>proprietas</u>) (Vidal
vs. Posadas, 58 Phil. 108; De Guzman vs. lbea, 67 Phil. 633); (2) the transÂ­fer
is revocable before the transferor's death and revocability may be provided for
indirectly by means of a reserved power in the donor to dispose of the
properties conveyed (Bautista vs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sabiniano, 92 Phil. 244), and (3) the transfer would be void if the
transferor survived the transferee.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, in a donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> it is
the donor's death that determines the acquisition of, or the right to, the
property donated, and the donation is revocable at the donor's will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the donation took effect immediately
upon the donee's acceptance thereof and it was subject to the resolutory
condition that the donation would be revoked if the donee did not give the
donor a certain quantity of rice or a sum of money, the donation is <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Zapanta

<p class="BODY">Justice Reyes in the subsequent case of Puig vs. PeÃ±aflorida,
L-15939, <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1965</st1:date>,
15 SCRA 276, synthesized the rules as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. That the Civil Code recognizes only gratuitous transfers of
property which are <span class="GramE">effected</span> by means of donations <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u> or by last will and testament executed with the requisite legal formalities.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
donations the act is immediately operative even if the material or physical
delivery (execution) of the property may be deferred until the donor's death,
whereas, in a testamentary disposition, nothing is conveyed to the grantee and
nothing is acquired by him until the death of the grantor-testator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disposition is ambulatory and not final.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in a <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>
disposition the conveyance or alienation should be (expressly or by necessary
implication) revocable <u>ad</u> <u>nutum</u> or at the discretion of the
grantor or so-called donor if he changes his mind (Bautista vs. Sabiniano, 92
Phil. 244).</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, consequently, the
specification in the deed of the cases whereby the act may be revoked by the
donor indicates that the donation is <span class="GramE"><u>inter</u></span> <u>vivos</u>
and not a <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> disposition (Zapanta vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Posadas</st1:place></st1:city>,
52 Phil. 557).</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the designation of
the donation as <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>, or a provision in the deed to the
effect that the donation is to take effect at the death of the donor", is
not a controlling criterion because those statements are to be construed
together with the rest of the instrument in order to give effect to the real
intent of the transferor (Laureta vs. Mata and Magno, 44 Phil. 668; Concepcion
vs. Concepcion, 91 Phil. 823; Cuevas vs. Cuevas, 98 Phil. 68).</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That a conveyance for an
onerous consideration is governed by the rules of contracts and not by those of
donations or testaments (Carlos vs. Ramil, 20 Phil. 183; Manalo vs. De Mesa, 29
Phil. 495).</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in case of doubt the
conveyance should be deemed a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>, rather than <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u>, in order to avoid uncertainty as to the ownership of the property
subject of the deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be added that the fact that the donation is given in
consideration of love and affection or past or future services is not a
characteristic of donations <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> because transfers <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> may be made also for those reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is difficulty in applying the distinctions to controversial
cases because it is not easy sometimes to ascertain when the donation takes
effect or when the full or naked title passes to the transferee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Manresa observes, "when the time
fixed for the commencement of the enjoyment of the property donated be at the
death of the donor, or when the suspensive condition is related to his death,
confusion might arise" (5 Codigo Civil, 6th Ed., p. 108).</p>

<p class="BODY">The existence in the deed of donation of conflicting stipulations
as to its effectivity may generate doubt as to the donor's intention and as to
the nature of the donation (Concepcion vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Concepcion</st1:place></st1:city>,
91 Phil. 823).</p>

<p class="BODY">Where the donor declared in the deed that the conveyance was <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> and forbade the registration of the deed before her death, the clear
inference is that the conveyance was not intended to produce any definitive
effect <span class="GramE">nor</span> to pass any interest to the grantee except
after her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the
grantor's reservation of the right to dispose of the property during her
lifetime means that the transfer is not binding on her until she dies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not mean that the title passed to the
grantee during her lifetime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Ubalde Puig vs. Magbanua PeÃ±aflorida, L-15939, Resolution of
January 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 136).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the following cases, the conveyance was considered a void <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> transfer because it was not cast in the form of a last will and
testament as required in article 728, formerly article 620:</p>

<p class="BODY">But if the deed of donation makes an actual conveyance of the
property to the donee, subject to a life estate in the donors, the donation is <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u> (Guarin vs. De Vera, 100 Phil. 1100).</p>

<p class="BODY">Articles 729, 730 and 731 have to some extent dissipated the
confusion surrounding the two kinds of donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule in article 729 is a crystallization
of the doctrine announced in decided cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">A clear instance where the donor made an <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
donation is found in De Guzman vs. lbea, 67 Phil. 633.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, it was provided in the deed
that the donor donated to the donee certain properties so that the donee
"may hold the same as her own and always" and that the donee would
administer the lands donated and deliver the fruits thereof to the donor, as
long as the donor was alive, but upon the donor's death the said fruits would
belong to the donee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that
the naked ownership was conveyed to the donee upon the execution of the deed of
donation and, therefore, the donation became effective during the donor's
lifetime.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Sambaan vs. Villanueva, 71 Phil. 303, the deed of donation, as
in Balaqui vs. Dongso, 53 Phil. 673, contained conflicting provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was provided in the deed that the donation
was made "en consideracion al afecto y cariÃ±o" of the donor for the
donee but that the donation "surtirÃ¡ efectos despuÃ©s de ocurrida mi
muerte" (donor's death).</p>

<p class="BODY">That donation was held to be <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> because
death was not the consideration for the donation but rather the donor's love
and affection for the donee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stipulation that the properties would be delivered only after the donor's death
was regarded as a mere modality of the contract which did not change its <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u> character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donor had
stated in the deed that he was donating, ceding and transferring the donated
properties to the donee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Joya vs.
Tiongco, 71 Phil. 379).</p>

<p class="BODY">In Laureta vs. Mata and Magno, 44 Phil. 668 the deed of donation
provided that the donor was donating <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> certain
properties as a reward for the donee's services to the donor and as a token of
the donor's affection for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
donation was made under the condition that "the donee cannot take
possession of the properties donated before the death of the donor"; that
the donee should cause to be held annually masses for the repose of the donor's
soul, and that he should defray the expenses for the donor's funeral.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that the said donation was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
despite the statement in the deed that it was <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donation was construed as a conveyance <u>in</u>
<u>praesenti</u> ("a present grant of a future interest") because it
conveyed to the donee the title to the properties donated "subject only to
the life estate of the donor" and because the conveyance took effect upon
the making and delivery of the deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
acceptance of the donation was a circumstance which was taken into account in
characterizing the donation as <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Balaqui vs. Dongso, <u>supra</u>, the deed of donation
involved was more confusing than that found in the <u>Laureta</u> case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>Balaqui</u> case, it was provided
in the deed that the donation was made in consideration of the services
rendered to the donor by the donee; that "title" to the donated
properties would not pass to the donee during the donor's lifetime, and that it
would be only upon the donor's death that the donee would become the "true
owner" of the donated properties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, there was the stipulation that that the donor bound herself to
answer to the donee for the property donated and that she warranted that nobody
would disturb or question the donee's right.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the provision in the deed that it was only after
the donor's death when the "title" to the donated properties would
pass to the donee and when the donee would become the owner thereof, it was
held in the <u>Balaqui</u> case that the donation was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It was noted in that case that the donor, in making a warranty,
implied that the title had already been conveyed to the donee upon the
execution of the deed and that the donor merely reserved to herself the
"possession and usufruct" of the donated properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Concepcion vs. Concepcion, 91 Phil. 823, it was provided in
the deed of donation, which was also styled as <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>, that
the donation was made in consideration of the services rendered by the donee to
the donor and of the donor's affection for the donee; that the donor had
reserved what was necessary for his maintenance, and that the donation "ha
de producir efectos solamente por muerte de la donante".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was ruled that the donation was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
because the stipulation that the donation would take effect only after the
donor's death "simply meant that the possession and enjoyment, of the
fruits of the properties donated should take effect only after the donor's
death and not before".</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Resolution of the instant case</u><span class="GramE">.-</span>
The donation in the instant case is <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> because it took
effect during the lifetime of the donors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was already effective during the donors' lifetime, or immediately
after the execution of the deed, as shown by the granting, <u>habendum</u> and
warranty clause of the deed (quoted below).</p>

<p class="BODY">In that clause it is stated that, in consideration of the
affection and esteem of the donors for the donees and the valuable services
rendered by the donees to the donors, the latter, by means of the deed of
donation, wholeheartedly transfer and unconditionally give to the donees the
lots mentioned and desÂ­cribed in the early part of the deed, free from any kind
of liens and debts:</p>

<blockquote>"Na dahil at alang-alang sa pagmamahal at masuyong pagtingin
na taglay ng NAGKAKALOOB (DONORS) sa Pinagkakalooban (DONEES) gayun din sa
tapat at mahalagang paglilingkod noong mga lumipas na panahon na ginawa ng huli
sa una, ang nabanggit na nagkakaloob sa pamagitan ng kasulatang ito ng
pagkakaloob (Donation) ay buong pusong inililipat at lubos na ibinibigay sa
nasabing pinagkakalooban ang lupang binabanggit at makikilala sa unahan nito,
laya sa ano mang sagutin at pagkakautang, katulad nito:"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following the above-quoted granting, <u>habendum</u> and warranty
clause is the donors' declaration that they donate (<u>ipinagkakaloob</u>) Lot
No. 2502, the property in litigation, in equal shares to their children Angel
Diaz and Andrea Diaz, the western part to Angel and the eastern part to Andrea.</p>

<p class="BODY">The acceptance clause is another indication that the donation is <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Donations <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>,
being in the form of a will, are never accepted by the donees during the
donors' lifetime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acceptance is a
requirement for donations <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In the acceptance clause herein, the donees declare that they
accept the donation to their entire satisfaction and, by means of the deed,
they acknowledge and give importance to the generosity and solicitude shown by
the donors and sincerely thank them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>reddendum</u> or reservation clause of the deed of
donation, it is stipulated that the donees would shoulder the expenses for the
illness and the funeral of the donors and that the donees cannot sell to a
third person the donated properties during the donorsâ lifetime but if the sale
is necesÂ­sary to defray the expenses and support of the donors, then the sale
is valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The limited right to dispose of the donated lots, which the deed
gives to the donees, implies that ownership had passed to them by means of the
donation and that, therefore, the donaÂ­tion was already effective during the
donors' lifetime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is a characteristic
of a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, paragraph 3 of the <u>reddendum</u> or reservation
clause provides that "also, while we, the spouses Gabino Diaz and Severa
Mendoza, are alive, our administration, right, and ownership of the lots mentioned
earlier as our properties shall continue but, upon our death, the right and
ownership of the donees to each of the properties allocated to each of them
shall be fully effective".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
foregoing is the translation of the last paragraph of the deed of donation
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"(3) Gayun din,
samantalang kaming magasawang Gabino Diaz at Severa Mendoza ay buhay, patuloy
ang aming pamamahala, karapatan, at pagkamayari sa mga nasabing pagaari na
sinasayay sa unahan nito na pagaari namin; ngunit sakaÂ­ling kami ay bawian ng
buhay ng Panginoong Dios at mamatay na, ang mga karapatan at pagkamayari ng
bawaât pinagkalooban (Donatarios) sa bawa't pagaari nauukol sa bawa't isa ay
may lubos na kapangyarihan."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the draftsman of the deed did not realize the discordant
and ambivalent provisions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>habendum</u>
clause indicates the transfer of the ownership over the donated properties to
the donees upon the execution of the deed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the <u>reddendum</u> clause seems to imply that the ownership was
retained by the donors and would be transferred to the donees only after their
death.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have reflected on the meaning of the said contradictory
clauses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the provisions of the deed,
like those of a statute and testament, should be construed together in order to
ascertain the intention of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That task would have been rendered easier if the record shows the
conduct of the donors and the donees after the execution of the deed of
donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the record is silent on that point, except for the allegation
of Angel Diaz in his answer (already mentioned) that he received his share of
the disputed lot long before the donors' death and that he had been
"openly and adversely occupying" his share "for more than twenty
years".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Andrea Diaz on page 17 of
her brief in L-33849 states that the donees took possession of their respective
shares as stipulated in the deed of donation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Pages 3, 4, 18 and 19, tsn March, 1971).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion is that the aforequoted paragraph 3 of the <u>reddendum</u>
or reservation clause refers to the <u>beneficial</u> <u>ownership</u> (<u>dominium</u>
<u>utile</u>) and not to the naked title and that what the donors reserved to <span class="GramE">themselves</span>, by means of that clause, was the management of
the donated lots and the fruits thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, notwithstanding that reservation, the donation, as shown in the <u>habendum</u>
clause, was already effective during their lifetime and was not made in
contemplation of their death because the deed transferred to the donees the
naked ownership of the donated properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">That conclusion is further supported by the fact that in the deed
of donation, out of the eight lots owned by the donors, only five were
donated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three lots, Lots Nos. 4168,
2522 and 2521 were superfluously reserved for the spouses or donors in addition
to one-third of Lot No. 2377.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
deed of donation in question was intended to be a <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>
disposition, then all the eight lots would have been donated or devised to the
three children and daughter-in-law of the donors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's conclusion that the said deed of donation, although
void as a donation <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>, is valid "as an
extrajudicial partition among the parents and their children" is not
well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1080 of the Civil
Code provides that "should a person make a partition of <u>his estate</u>
by an act <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>, or by will, such partition shall be
respected, insofar as it does not prejudice the legitime of the compulsory
heirs."</p>

<p class="BODY">We have already observed that the said donation was not a
partition of the entire estate of the Diaz spouses since, actually, only five
of the eight lots, constituting their estate, were partitioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, that partition is not the one
contemplated in article 1080.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another circumstance which strengthens the view that the
<u>1949</u> deed of donation in question took effect during the donors'
lifetime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be noted that in that
deed <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 2377 (items 3 and [c]) was divided into
three equal parts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one-third was donated
to Andrea Diaz and one-third to Angel Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The remaining one-third was reserved and retained by the donors, the spouses
Gabino Diaz and Severa Mendoza, for their support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That reserved one-third portion came to be
known as Lot No. 2377-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1964, or after the death of Gabino Diaz, his surviving spouse
Severa Mendoza executed a donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> wherein she conveyed
to her daughter, Andrea Diaz (plaintiff-appellant herein), her one-half share
in Lot No. 2377-A, which one-half share is known as Lot No. 2377-A-1, the other
half or Lot No. 2377-A-2<b> </b>having been already conveyed to Angel Diaz.</p>

<p class="BODY">That disposition of Lot No. 2377-A-2 clearly implies that the
conveyance in the 1949 deed of donation as to Lot No. 2377 took effect during
the lifetime of the donors, Gabino Diaz and Severa Mendoza, and proves that the
1949 donation was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case has a close similarity to the prewar cases
already cited and to three post-liberation cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>Bonsato</u> case, the deed of
donation also contained contradictory dispositions which rendered the deed
susceptible of being consÂ­trued as a donation <u>inter vivos</u> or as a donation
<u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It was stated in one part of the deed that the donor was
executing "una donacion perfecta e irrevocable consumada" in favor of
the donee in consideration of his past services to the donor; that at the time
of the execution of the deed, the donor "ha entregado" to the donee
"dichos terrenos donados"; that while the donor was alive, he would
receive the share of the fruits corresponding to the owner; and "que en
vista de la vejez del donante, el donatario Felipe Bonsato tomarÃ¡ posesion inmeÂ­diatamente
de dichos terrenos a su favor".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These provisions indicate that the donation in question was <u>inter</u>
<u>vivos</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in the last clause of the deed in the <u>Bonsato</u>
case (as in the instant case), it was provided "que despuÃ©s de la muerte
del donante entrarÃ¡ en vigor dicha donacion y el donatario Felipe Bonsato
tendrÃ¡ todos los derechos de dichos terrenos en concepto de dueÃ±o absoluto de
la propiedad libre de toda responsabilidad y gravamen y pueda ejercitar su
derecho que crea conveniente".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
provisions would seem to show that the donation was <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, it was held in the <u>Bonsato</u> case that the
donation was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> because (1) the ownership of the things
donated passed to the donee; (2) it was not provided that the transfer was
revocable before the donor's death, and (3) it was not stated that the transfer
would be void if the transferor should survive the transferee.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was further held in the <u>Bonsato</u> case that the
stipulation "que despuÃ©s de la muerte del donante entrarÃ¡ en vigor dicha
donacion", should be interpreted together with the prior proviÂ­sion
regarding its irrevocable and consummated character, and that would mean that
the charge or condition as to the donor's share of the fruits would be
terminated upon the donor's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Puig</u> case, <u>supra</u>, is even more doubtful and
controversial than the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the <u>Puig</u> case, the donor, Carmen Ubalde Vda.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> Parcon, in a deed entitled "Donacion <u>Mortis</u> <u>Causa</u>"
dated <st1:date year="1948" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1948</st1:date>
"cede y transfiere, en concepto de donacion <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>",
to the donee, Estela Magbanua PeÃ±aflorida, three parcels of land in
consideration of the donee's past services and the donor's love and affection
for the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was stipulated in the deed that the <u>donor</u> could
alienate or mortgage the donated properties "cuando y si necesita fondos
para satisfacer sus propias necesidades, sin que para ello tenga que intervenir
la Donataria, pues su consentimiento se sobre entiende aqui, parte de que la
donacion que aqui se hace es <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>, es decir que la
donacion surtirÃ¡ sus efectos a la muerte de la donante".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was repeated in another clause of the deed
"que la cesiÃ³n y transferencia aqui provista surtirÃ¡ efecto al fallecer la
Donante".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was further stipulated that the donee would defray the medical
and funeral expenses of the donor unless the donor had funds in the bank or
"haya cosecho levantada o recogida, en cual caso dichos recursos
responderÃ¡n portales gastos a disposicion y direcciÃ³n de la donataria".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another provision of the deed was that it
would be registered only after the donor's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same deed the donee accepted the
donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Puig case the donor in another deed entitled
"Escritura de Donacion <u>Mortis</u> <u>Causa</u>" dated December 28,
<u>1949</u> donated to the same donee, Estela Magbanua PeÃ±aflorida, three
parcels of land "en concepto de una donacion <u>mortis</u> <u>cause</u>"
in consideration of past services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was provided in the deed "que antes de su muerte, la donante, podrÃ¡
enajenar vender, traspasar o hipotecar a cualesquiera persona o entidades los
bienes aqui donados a favor de la donataria en concepto de una donacion <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donee accepted
the donation in the same deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the donor's death both deeds were recorded in the registry
of deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the donor's will dated <st1:date year="1951" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1951</st1:date>, which was duly
probated, the donation of a parcel of land in the second deed of donation was
confirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under these facts, it was held that the <u>1948</u> deed of
donation <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> in character
in spite of repeated expressions therein that it was a <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u>
donation and that it would take effect only upon the donorâs death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those expressions were not regarded as
controlling because they were contradicted by the provisions that the donee would
defray the donor's expenses even if not connected with her illness and that the
donee's husband would assume her obligations under the deed, should the donee
predecease the donor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
donor did not reserve in the deed the absolute right to revoke the donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the <u>1949</u> deed of donation was declared void because it
was a true conveyance <u>mortis</u> <u>causa</u> which was not embodied in a
last will and testament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> character of the disposition is shown by the donor's reservation
of the right to alienate or encumber the donated properties to any person or
entity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Cuevas</u> case, <u>supra</u>, one Antonina Cuevas
executed on <st1:date year="1950" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1950</st1:date>
a notarial conveyance styled as "Donacion Mortis Cause" where she
ceded to her nephew Crispulo Cuevas a parcel of unregistered land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crispulo accepted the donation in the same
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1952" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1952</st1:date>, the donor revoked the
donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deed of donation in the <u>Cuevas</u> case contained the
following provisions which, as in similar cases, are susceptible of being
construed as making the conveyance an <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> or a <u>mortis</u>
<u>causa</u> transfer:</p>

<blockquote>"Dapat maalaman ni Crispulo Cuevas na samantalang ako ay
nabubuhay, ang lupa na ipinagkakaloob ko sa kaniya ay ako pa rin ang patuloy na
mamomosecion, makapagpapatrabajo, makikinabang at ang iba pang karapatan sa
pagmamayari ay sa akin pa rin hanggang hindi ako binabawian ng buhay ng
Maykapal at ito naman ay hindi ko Ã±ga iya-alis pagkat kung ako ay mamatay na ay
inilalaan ko sa kaniya."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Translation</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Crispulo Cuevas should know that while I am alive, the land
which I donated to him will still be under my continued possession; I will be
the one to have it cultivated; I will enjoy its fruits and all the other rights
of ownership until Providence deprives me of life and I cannot take away the
property from him because when I die I reserve the property for him."
(sic)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was held that the donation was <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>
because the phrase "hindi ko Ã±ga iya-alis" ("I will not take
away the property") meant that the donor expressly renounced the right to
freely dispose of the property in favor of another person and thereby
manifested the irrevocability of the conveyance of the naked title to the
donee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donor retained the beneficial
ownership or <u>dominium</u> <u>utile</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being an <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u> donation, it could be revoked by the
donor only on the grounds specified by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No such grounds exised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donee
was not guilty of ingratitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other point to be disposed of is the matter of the claim for
attorney's fees of Andrea Diaz against the Alejandro intervenors.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of
the case, particularly the apparent good faith of the Alejandro intervenors in
asserting a one-third interest in the disputed lot and their close relationship
to Andrea Diaz, we find that it is not proper to require them to pay attorney's
fees (Salao vs. Salao, L-26699, March 16, 1976, 70 SCRA 65).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Andrea Diaz did not implead Angel Diaz as a
respondent in her petition for review.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's amended decision is reversed
insofar as it pronounces that the deed of donation is void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That donation is declared valid as a donation
<u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The disputed lot should be partitioned in accordance with that
deed between Andrea Diaz and Angel Diaz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision is affirmed insofar as it does not require the
Alejandro intervenors to pay attorney's fees to Andrea Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ANTONIO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I agree that all
the features concordantly pointed out by Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
indicate that the conveyance was intended to produce definitive effect upon the
execution of said instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
important characteristic of a donation <i>inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span></i>
is that it takes effect independently of the donor's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the donor states that he donates
the properties subject to the "condition that the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>
cannot take possession of the properties donated until after my death",<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
or the ownership and possession of the property, as well as its administration,
were turned over to the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>, but the right to reap
and dispose of the fruits was deferred until after the death of the donor,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
or when it was expressly stated that the donation would take effect upon
acceptance, but would be revoked <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> upon the
non-fulfillment of certain conÂ­ditions,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
it has been held that the donation is <i>inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span></i>,
and the ownership over the property donated is transferred to the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A donation <i>inters <span class="SpellE">vivos</span></i> is a
gratuitous contract whereby the donor divests himself, at present and
irrevocably, of the thing given in favor of the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>
and, therefore, like any other contract, requires the concurrence of the reciprocal
consent of the parties, and does not become perfect until it is accepted by the
<span class="SpellE">donee</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As observed by <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
upon acceptance by the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>, the donor can no longer
withdraw, and he can be compelled to comply with his offering or to deliver the
things he wanted to donate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it may not be revoked unilaterally or by the sole and
arbitrary will of the donor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
donation, however, may be made revocable upon the fulfillment of <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> conditions,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
or may be revoked only for the reasons provided in Articles 760, 764 and 765 of
the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As explained in <i>Bautista,
et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
except "in the instances expressly provided by law, such as the subsequent
birth of children of the donor, failure by the donee to comply with the
conditions imposed, ingratitude of the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> and
reduction of the donation in the event of inofficiousness thereof, a donation
is irrevocable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the donor reserves
the right to revoke it or if he reserves the right to dispose of all the
properties purportedly donated, there is no donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the disposition or conveyance or transfer
takes effect upon the donor's death and becomes <i>irrevocable</i> only upon
his death, it is not <i>inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span></i> but a <i>mortis
<span class="SpellE">causa</span></i> donation." Here, the conveyance or
alienation of the properties donated is not revocable <i>ad <span class="SpellE">nutum</span></i>.</p>
