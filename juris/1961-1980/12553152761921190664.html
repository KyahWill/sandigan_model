				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The client charges his lawyer with having fraudulently
  made him sign a compromise agreement favoring his adversary. The respondent says the signature was stamped
  on the document with full knowledge of its contents.
<p> After an investigation wherein both sides presented evidence, the Office of the Solicitor General, found for the
  client and submitted the reglementary complaint, recommending disciplinary action.  </p>
<p>Required to answer, the attorney reiterated his innocence, asked for, and was granted, opportunity to submit
  additional evidence—which he did before the Clerk of this
  Court. The latter filed his report, copies of which were
  furnished to the parties in interest.</p>
<p> The material facts are these: on March 28, 1948, the complainant
sold his sugar mill located in San Jose, Nueva Ecija, to Juan Torres,
who promised to pay therefor the amount of P3000 on or before March 30,
1949. As the price was not paid on the date due, complainant engaged
the services of herein respondent to prosecute his claim. Accordingly
the corresponding complaint (Civil Case No. 1246) was filed to recover
said amount with interest, damages and attorney's fees, on August 1,
1953 in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija. Served with summons
three days later, Juan Torres accompanied by his son-in-law, Vicente
Jose, went to see the complainant for extra-judicial settlement. The
three proceeded to the respondent's house where after a short
conversation, the respondent typed in Tagalog, a document which he
asked the complainant to sign, and the latter signed after receiving
P200 that came from Juan Torres. Salamanca claims—and so testified—he
did not know the contents of the document he signed. On the other hand
Attorney Bautista swore he translated it to him and that Salamanca
otherwise knew it was an amicable settlement.</p>
<p> The main issue is whether Salamanca knew the contents
  of the document at the time he signed it. The Solicitor
  General's Office believes he did not, because (1) it was
  written in Tagalog, which the lawyer "must have used" to
  deceive his Ilocano client, who did not understand the national language and (2) it was prejudicial to the client,
  who received <em>only P200</em> out of his claim of P3000.</p>
<p> In our view the first point does not. mean much, considering that, according to the Solicitor General, the contract
  signed by Salamanca employing the services of respondent,
  was also written in Tagalog; yet there is no claim of deceit
  in the establishment of their professional relationship.  </p>
<p>Indeed, in San Jose, Nueva Ecija, where the incident occurred,
Tagalog is generally understood, according to Justice of the Peace
Gelacio T. Yusi of that town. </p>
<p>The second point besides contradicting parts of the
  document, has entirely rejected the attorney's explanation
  which seems to tally with the document and subsequent
  events. It is not accurate to assert that Salamanca got
  P200 (or P260)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> only; the paper stipulates that the mill
  would be sold and <em>the proceeds given to Salamanca</em>.. In
  fact, the parties foresaw the possibility of selling it for
  more than P2000 and so, they agreed that the excess, if
  any, <em>would also be delivered to Salamanca</em>. Furthermore,
  the parties agreed that if the mill could not be sold, Salamanca could get it back. As to the difference between
  P3000 and P2,200, Atty. Bautista said he was informed that
  Torres had made previous partial payments.</p>
<p> On the other hand the position of the client appears to be
  unbelievable on several counts. First. How could he swear
  he did not know what the P200-peso was for? He knew
  it came from his adversary, who had asked him to <em>"settle
  the case amicably"</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  and in whose presence it was given to
  him (Exh. A). </p>
<p>Second. He was required to sign, according to him, a
  paper the contents of which he allegedly did not know; and
  yet for several months he made <em>no efforts to have it translated</em>—he having a grandnephew who was then studying
  law (Bienvenido Salamanca), who by the way declared
  later before the investigator, that his said relative understood the contents of the document, so much so that he told
  him (Bienvenido) <em>way back in 1953 </em>that his case had been
  settled. </p>
<p>Third. Again, remembering that the document was
  signed in August, 1953 and that Salamanca objected to it only in January, 1955, one is apt to inquire, why the
  delay? The answer is, because the sugar mill could not be
  sold,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Salamanca did not receive the P2000 and did not
  want to get the sugar mill back. As respondent explained
  before the investigator, his client all but blamed him for
  their failure to sell the mill, and so they had a tiff which
  culminated in this accusation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> At this juncture we observe that this significant delay had not passed unnoticed
  to the complainant (or to the person who drafted the complaint for him), because he dated the charges January 14,
  1954 although he filed them here only on January, 1955.  </p>
<p>Fourth. Now if it were true, as suggested by complainant that in drafting the compromise agreement respondent
  had connived with Juan Torres, respondent would have
  hurriedly asked for withdrawal of the complaint in order
  not to give Salamanca time to consult others about the document<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  and then repudiate it. Yet none of this happened.
  On the contrary, the petition to withdraw was actually
  presented to the Court only when Salamanca, attempting
  to ignore it, pressed for further action on his judicial demand.  </p>
<p>At this juncture a few paragraphs of clarification are
  needed.  </p>
<p>When our Clerk of Court was commissioned to receive
  additional evidence for respondent, he sent for the original
  record of the case (Salamanca <i>vs.</i> Torres) in the Court
  of First Instance of Nueva Ecija.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Having found therein
  that the question whether the compromise agreement had
  actually been fully understood and approved by the client
  was debated before the court, he reported<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the advisability
  of awaiting such court's decision and/or the Court of Appeals decision if any, on the factual issue. Copies of the
  report were furnished the parties; and none of them objected to the suggestion.</p>
<p> Said Court record shows that copy of Salamanca's complaint to recover P3000 pesos had been served on the
  defendant Torres on August 3,1953. Up to February, 1955
  no step was taken or pleading filed in the case. Now, we
  think, if there had been no compromise, the defendant
  would ordinarily have answered on time or the plaintiff would have asked for default, and presentation of his evidence. No such move was taken; obviously because both
  parties knew there was a settlement, which superseded the
  court proceedings.</p>
<p> It was only when herein complainant <em>decided to repudiate</em> the compromise<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that he hired a new lawyer, and
  the latter upon reading the court record as then existing
  as for default of defendant in March, 1955—and obtained favorable action. But defendant Torres promptly
  showed the compromise agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and, explaining the
  failure to file a motion to withdraw the complaint pursuant
  thereto, asked for relief. Acting on the motion the court
  dismissed the complaint, in the face of the compromise.
  The plaintiff then countered with a motion to reconsider
  the dismissal, repeated his allegations of deceit, and
  referred to his denunciation of Attorney Bautista in this
  court. Wherefore on April 28, 1955 the Nueva Ecija
  Court ordered plaintiff to furnish copies thereof—marked
  as annexes—to defendant. The court further directed
  that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * And the hearing on the motion for reconsideration filed
    by the plaintiff is hereby <em>suspended until</em> the defendant is furnished
    with the copies of the said annexes. <em>And the motion again set for
    hearing by plaintiff"</em> (Italic supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fifth. To repeat, the above order was issued on April
  28,1955. And yet up to March 8,1962 <em>plaintiff Salamanca did nothing in the expediente.</em> His counsel knows—or ought to know—that the complaint could be properly
  dismissed by the court for failure, within a reasonable
  time, to prosecute or to comply with the court's order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  His counsel also is aware of our clerk's recommendation
  that the case here should be held in abeyance until the
  court below had decided the matter; and yet for seven
  years he failed to bring to judgment his action against
  Torres. Why? Because the circumstances do not support
  the allegation of deception by Attorney Bautista, who,
  according to the evidence, enjoys a good reputation in
  the community in which he practices his profession. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, this complaint for malpractice must be, and
  is hereby dismissed. So ordered.  </p>
