				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In 1958 two shipments of caustic soda were consigned to Procter
&amp; Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corporation from <st1:place><st1:city>San
  Francisco</st1:city>, <st1:state>California</st1:state>, <st1:country-region>U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
on board the ves­sels Bronxville and <span class="SpellE">Banggai</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From said vessels, which were then anchored
outside the breakwater in <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the caustic soda was unloaded onto lighters of the Atlan­tic Gulf &amp; Pacific
Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lighters were towed by tug­boats
also of the Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. to Procter &amp; Gamble's private
wharf at <span class="SpellE">Estero</span> Vitas, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> from where the caustic soda
was finally transferred to warehouses belonging to Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>

<p class="BODY">On those two shipments, the Collector of Customs of Manila levied
and collected a total sum of P720.00 as <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues
imposed under Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Procter &amp; Gamble formally protested said collection on the ground that it
did not use a Government wharf or facility to unload the merchandise in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Collector of Customs of
Manila denied the protests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon
Procter &amp; Gamble appealed to the Commissioner of Customs who sustained the
Collector's de­cision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then appealed
to the Court of Tax Appeals and said court also upheld the decision of the
Commis­sioner of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration having been denied, Procter &amp; Gamble petitioned this Court
to review the Tax Court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">At issue is whether or not Procter &amp; Gamble is liable for the
payment of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues imposed in Section 2802 of
the Tariff and Customs Code on the two shipments of caustic soda which were not
unloaded on a Government wharf.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code has for its origin
Section 14 of the Philippine Tariff Act of 1909 which we quote hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That there
shall be levied and collected upon all articles, goods, wares and merchandise
except coal, lumber, creosoted, and other pressure treated materials <span style="">as </span>well as
other minor forest products, cement, gua­no, natural rock asphalt, the minerals
and ores of copper, lead, zinc, iron, and steel metals, refractory gold ores,
and sugar mo­lasses, the products of the Philippines, ex­ported through ports
of entry of the Philip­pines, or shipped <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> to
the United States or any of its possessions, a duty of one dollar per gross ton
of one thousand ki­los, as a charge for <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>,
irrespective of the port of destination or nationality of the exporting
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of logs, or <span class="SpellE">flitches</span> twelve inches square or equiva­lent
cross-sectional area, or over, a charge of thirty cents per cubic meter shall
be col­lected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All articles, goods, wares, or merchan­dise imported,
exported, or shipped in tran­sit for the use of the Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Uni­ted
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, or of that of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
shall be exempt from the charge prescribed in this section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section <span style="">14 </span>imposed <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues only on
exports<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and were held to be payable although the subject merchandise were loaded from a
private wharf.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In 1909 our legislators knew that there was no Government wharf existing and it
was found safe to assume that the Government intended to collect <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fees, even without the use of Government owned
wharves, in order to raise funds for the acquisi­tion and construction of
wharves throughout the islands.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
</span>1955 <span style="">Congress enacted Republic
Act </span>1371, <span style="">imposing in Section </span>3
<span style="">thereof <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues on imports and exports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote
Section </span>3 <span style="">hereunder:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. <span style="">3. </span>There
shall be levied, collected and paid on all articles imported or brought into
the Philippines, and on products of the Philippines, except coal, lumber,
creosoted and other pressure treated materials as well as other minor forest
products, cement, guano, natural rock asphalt, the minerals and ores of base
metals (e.g., copper, lead, zinc, iron, <span class="SpellE">chromite</span>,
manganese, <span class="SpellE">magnesite</span> and steel), and sugar molasses,
exported from the Philippines a charge of two pesos per gross metric ton as a
fee for <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u><span style="">Provided</span></u><span style="">, </span>That in the case of logs, or <span class="SpellE">flitches</span> twelve inches square or equivalent cross-sectional
area, or over, a charge of sixty centavos per cubic meter shall be
collected:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Provided</span></u><span style="">, </span><u>further</u>,
That such <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fee shall not be levied on
articles imported or brought into the Philippines which are unloaded on private
wharves."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Interpreting Section <span style="">3, </span>this Court stated in Commissioner
of Customs v. Superior Gas &amp; Equipment Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that the in­tention of Congress was not to levy <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
fee on mer­chandise unloaded at places other than Government wharves or without
making use of pier facilities and the proviso exempting from the <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fee all such imported merchandise makes this
intention all the more evident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, however, in <span style="">1957 </span>Congress
passed Republic Act <span style="">1937, </span>otherwise
known as the Tariff and Customs Code which in Section 2802 thereof provides for
the payment of <span class="SpellE">whar­fage</span> dues on imports and
exports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 2802 states:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2802.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">Schedule of Dues</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>There
shall be levied, collected and paid on all ar­ticles imported or brought into
the Philippines, and on products of the Philippines except coal, lumber,
creosoted and other pressure treated materials as well as other minor forest
pro­ducts, cement, guano, natural rock asphalt, the minerals and ores of base
metals (e.g., copper, lead, zinc, iron, <span class="SpellE">chromite</span>,
manganese, <span class="SpellE">magne­site</span> and steel), and sugar molasses,
exported from the Philippines, a charge of two pesos per gross metric ton as a
fee for <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided</u>, That in the case of logs, or <span class="SpellE">flitches</span>
twelve inches square or equivalent cross-sectional area, or over, a charge of
sixty centa­vos per cubic meter shall be collected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 2802 is an almost verbatim copy
of Section <span style="">3 </span>of Republic Act <span style="">1371 </span>minus the proviso-</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> That
such <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> fee shall not be levied on articles
imported or brought into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which are unloaded on private wharves."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Procter &amp; Gamble maintains that the interpretation of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues in Commissioner of Customs v. Superior Gas
&amp; Equipment Co., supra, that <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are
com­pensation or rental for the use of <span style="">a
</span>wharf, and no <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues shall be collected
where no Government wharf is used, shall be applied in this case because
Section <span style="">2802 </span>of the Tariff and
Customs Code, the law applicable herein, was derived from Section <span style="">3 </span>of Republic Act <span style="">1371.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
a matter of fact, it adds, Section 2801 of the Tariff and Customs Code adopted
the definition of "<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues" provided
for in Section 1(b) of Republic Act 1371.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Commissioner of Customs and the Court of
Tax Appeals are of the opinion that Section <span style="">2802 </span>should be given an interpretation different from that
enunciated in Commissioner of Customs v. Superior Gas &amp; Equipment Co.,
supra, on Section 3 of Republic Act <span style="">1371
</span>for the reason that Section <span style="">2802,
</span>unlike Section 3, does not provide for an exemption from <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues on goods unloaded on private wharves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counter to this argu­ment, Procter &amp;
Gamble contends that the afore-stated exemption clause is merely a <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> and therefore its presence in or absence from
the law will not alter the meaning of "<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It moreover avers that the
Tariff and Customs Code, a codification of existing tariff and customs laws, is
presumed to have incorporated pertinent laws without change and any
modification introduced therein was merely to simplify the language of the law
but not to change its meaning.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the Tariff and Customs Code levies
charges on the different activities of a vessel engaged in foreign trade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For coming to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from a foreign port or for going to a foreign port from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
one pays tonnage dues.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
For entrance into or departure from a port of entry, harbor fees are collected.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Wharfage</span></u></span><u><span style=""> dues are assessed against the carg</span>o</u>
discharged by a vessel engaged in foreign trade.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Berthing charges are levied on a vessel coming or mooring within specified
places or waters of a port.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A vessel ordinarily enters a harbor and lays anchor or moors in a
port to load, to unload or both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
doing so, the vessel derives benefit from port facilities provided and
maintained by the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, they are in fairness made to contribute a share in said Government
undertaking by payment of berthing charges and harbor fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, cargoes discharged to a Philip­pine port from a vessel engaged in
foreign trade derive benefit from port facilities provided and maintained by
the Government; <span style="">said </span>cargoes
should also share the cost of providing and keeping <span style="">a safe </span>port, in the form of <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span>
dues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, a <span style="">vessel </span>that anchors at <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bay</st1:placetype></st1:place> to seek protection from <span style="">a </span>storm is not charged <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues by the Bureau of Customs, although it may
have to pay harbor fees and berthing charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But when a vessel anchors at the Bay and discharges or unloads its cargo,
<span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues are forthwith collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as stated, said dues are assessed <span style="">against </span>the cargo discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the provision of the law
under which the assessment is based on the quantity, weight or measure of the
cargo received by the importer and/or discharged by such vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues
on the cargo are distinct from harbor fees or berthing charges on the vessel,
so much so <span style="">that </span>different
sections of the law cover them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since in the present case, the vessels involved called on port to
unload, as they <span style="">in </span>fact did,
some car­go, said cargo, having been unloaded amidst the safety afforded by the
port, <span style="">is</span> chargeable with <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, <span class="SpellE">wharfage</span> dues partake of the nature
of a tax which is collected by the Government to support its ope­ration in
relation to customs affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the above conclusion, We deem it unneces­sary to
discuss the other points raised by Procter &amp; Gam­ble.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against petitioner.</p>
