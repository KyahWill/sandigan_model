				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime in </span><span style="">1961, </span><span style="">petitioner-appellant </span>Arturo <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span>, as
Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiguin</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Misamis</span></span><span style=""> Oriental, was administratively </span>charged
for violation of Sec. 14 of the <span style="">1954 </span>Revised
Manual of Instructions to Treasurers and Sec. 614 of the Revised Administrative
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon finding that <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> had cash items consisting of National <span style="">and </span><span style="">Provincial </span>payrolls amounting to P<span style="">8,993.99 </span>paid by him without the
express approval of the Provincial Treasurer in violation of the provisions
above-<span style="">stated, the Civil Service
Commissioner, </span><span style="">on June 21, 1961, </span>found him guilty as charged in a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Wherefore, he is hereby fined his fifteen (15) days pay,
reprimanded and warned that commission of another offense will be dealt with
more severely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interest of the
service, he should likewise be transferred without demotion in rank or salary
such action not being considered disciplinary in character."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> moved for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by resolution of the Commissioner,
dated May 27, <span style="">1964, </span>which stated
further that "the aforementioned decision be executed immediately, it
appearing from the records that the respondent-petitioner has not yet paid the
fine imposed upon him and that he has not also been transferred."</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> to him of the
foregoing resolution by the Undersecretary of Finance for compliance, the Provincial
Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental issued <span style="">a </span>directive
on June <span style="">3, 1964 </span>reprimanding and
warning <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span>, ordering him to effect immediate payment
of the fine imposed and detailing him for assignment in the office of the Provincial
Treasurer in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
City, without demotion in rank or reduction in salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, the Provincial Treasurer
designated the assistant Municipal Treasurer, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Balanza</span>,
as officer in charge of the Municipal Treasurer's office of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>
in place of petitioner-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> refused to obey this directive,
insisting that the decision of the Commissioner was illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June <span style="">15,
1964, </span><span style="">he
appealed to </span>the Civil Service Board of Appeals claiming that his
conviction was without due process of law and that, given the <span class="GramE">opportunity,</span> he can justify all his acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> also
questioned the immediate execution of the decision on the ground that it has
not yet become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> since under Sec. <span style="">36 </span>of the Civil Service Act of <span style="">1959 </span>(Republic Act 2260) <span style="">he </span>still had
<span style="">30 </span>days within which to appeal
to the Civil Service Board of Appeals and on the further ground that his
transfer was unlawful since he did not consent there­to.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, <span style="">1964, </span><span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> went to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental with a petition for prohibition with
preliminary <span style="">injunction
</span>to prevent the immediate execution of the questioned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court issued the preliminary writ of <span style="">injunction </span>prayed
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But subsequently, the same court,
acting upon an urgent motion to dismiss filed by respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, dismissed the petition and dissolved the <span style="">preliminary
injunction, upholding </span><span style="">the </span>Commissioner's
right to execute his decision pending appeal to the Civil Service Board of
Appeals, and <span class="SpellE">Trocio's</span> recall to the Provincial
Treasurer's office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of his motion for reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> appealed to this Court raising questions purely of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August <span style="">6, 1964, </span>petitioner-appellant filed here a motion for issuance
of preliminary injunction to put him in possession of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="GramE">We</span> denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">At issue is the authority of the Commissioner of Civil Service to
enforce his decision pending its appeal to the Civil Service Boar of <span class="GramE">Appeals.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Revised
Civil Service Rules provides<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Commissioner shall transmit to the head of Department
concerned his decision on the case within six <span style="">months </span>from date of re<span style="">ceipt
of the complete record of the case and the head of Department shall, within 10
days from receipt thereof, serve the respondent a copy of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The <span style="">Commissioner, </span>if <span style="">public
interest so warrants, may </span>order his de<span style="">cision executed </span>pending appeal to the Civil Service Board </u></span><u><span style="">of </span></u><u><span style="">Appeals</span></u><span style="">.” (Underscoring
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant does not seriously question the <span style="">power, in general, of </span>the <span style="">Commissioner </span>to <span style="">execute </span>his <span style="">decision </span>pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What he assails, however, is <span style="">the
</span>correctness or propriety of the latter's action, submitting that public
interest - <u>meaning the interest of the Republic of the Philippines</u>, and
not that of <span class="SpellE">Mambajao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiguin</span>
<span class="SpellE">subprovince</span> - does not call for execution of the
decision pending appeal in <span style="">his </span>particular
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">submission is </span>untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner-appellant perhaps would be correct
if the Rules used the words "national interest".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even applying petitioner's concept of
"pu­blic interest", the result will be the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since as municipal treasurer, he undoubtedly
handles national as well as provincial and municipal funds, the interest of the
<span class="GramE">Republic,</span> or the "community at large" is
affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it <span style="">is primarily </span>for the Commissioner to determine when <span style="">public interest warrants </span>the
execution, pending ap­peal, of his decisions since that is not ministerial but
discretionary on his part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner-appellant then has the burden to show clearly that the action
undertaken by the Commissioner amounted to grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None having been shown, the dismissal of the
petition by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> cannot be validly assailed as
erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner-appellant
relies upon <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabigao</u></span><u> </u></span><u>v. Del </u><u><span style="">Ro</span>sario</u>, <span style="">L-18370, </span>Oct. <span style="">31, 1962, </span>for the proposition that Commissioner may execute his
decision pending appeal only <span style="">if </span><u><span style="">special </span>reasons</u> require it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is untenable. Sec. <span style="">28 </span>of
<span style="">Rule XVIII </span>of the Revised Civil
Service Rules does not require the presence of special reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, <span class="SpellE"><u>Cabigao</u></span><u>
v. <span style="">Del </span>Rosario</u> is not
authority for the prop<span style="">osition
maintained </span>by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>ratio</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span> there <span style="">was </span>that although the <span style="">decision
</span>of the Commissioner adverse to the government employee under
investigation is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Civil Service
Board of Appeals, the <u>former has discretion to enforce it and make it
effective pending appeal</u>, to protect public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence or absence of <span style="">special </span>reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
was not at issue, and hence anything <span style="">said
</span>on the point must be regarded as mere <u>obiter</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-appellant would also advance as an issue here the
correctness and legality of the questioned decision of the Civil Service
Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such question - which
goes to the merits of the case - is not a matter that should be passed upon
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be resolved in the Civil
Service Board of Appeals where the entire administrative decision is being
questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question here is
whether the decision of the Commissioner can be <span style="">legally </span>executed pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And under the facts and circumstances above described, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>hold that
it can.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">, the </span>order of dismissal appealed from
is hereby affirmed with costs against petitioner-appellant.</p>
