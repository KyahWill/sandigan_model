				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Direct appeal by the plaintiffs from a decision
of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing their complaint herein,
with costs against them.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although most of the allegations in said complaint had been
denied in defendants' <span class="GramE">answer</span>, the basic facts were
admitted in the memoranda filed by both parties with the lower court and
seemingly in the course of their oral argument therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the case was deemed submitted to <span class="GramE">said</span> court and the same rendered its appealed decision,
without receiving any evidence, with an opening statement to the effect that
"the facts of this case are undisputed."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is conceded that plaintiffs herein are civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>, holding positions, in the budget for the fiscal
year 1961-1962, under the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Raul R. Ingles has a first-grade
civil service eligibility, holding a WAPCO-classified position of Senior
Executive Assistant II, with a compen­sation of P6<span class="GramE">,888.00</span>
a year, and eight (8) years of service in the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Roaldo</span> G.
<span class="SpellE">Adviento</span> is, in turn, a second-grade civil service
eligible, holding a WAPCO-classified position of Clerk I, with a compensation
of <span style="">P1<span class="GramE">,<span style="">800.00</span></span></span> a year, and
four (4) years of service in the Government, whereas plaintiff Isabel C. Corpus
is a third-grade civil service eligible, holding a WAPCO-classified position of
Supervising Clerk I, with a compensation of P2,544.00 a year, and eight (8)
years of service in the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff Consuelo M. Villanueva is another third-grade civil service
eligible, holding a WAPCO-classified position of Clerk I, with a compensation
of P1<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> a year, and ten (10) years of service in
the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
plaintiff Esperanza M. Gutierrez is a third-grade civil service eligible, holding
a WAPCO classified position <span style="">of </span>Stenographer,
with a compensation of P1<span class="GramE">,980.00</span> a year, and eight (8)
years of service in the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">About the second week of January, 1962, plaintiffs received a
communication of the then Executive Secretary, <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, advising them that their services in the
Government were terminated as of January 1, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs appealed from this action to the
President, on or about January 26, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A month later, or on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1962</st1:date>, they received a letter of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>,
acting "by authority of the President, "denying the reconsideration
prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, or on March 24, 1962, plaintiffs commenced the
present action, in the Court of First Instance of Manila, against said
Executive Secretary and the Cash Disbursing Officer in the Office of the
President, alleging that they (plaintiffs) had been removed from office without
cause and without due process, and praying, accordingly, that judgment be
rendered ordering:</p>

<blockquote>“(1) Defendant Executive <span style="">Secretary
</span><span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span> to
certify the names of the petitioners in the payrolls of the Office of the
President, to be retroactive as of January 1, 1962, the effective date of
petitioners' illegal termination from employment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) Defendant <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> <span class="SpellE">Davocol</span> to pay the emoluments and/or salaries to which
plaintiffs are entitled, effective as of January 1, 1962, the date of their
illegal termination from service;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) Defendants to perform their duties as aforesaid and to
continue paying plaintiffs their emoluments and/or salaries to which said plaintiffs
are entitled to in accordance with law;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(4) Defendants to allow plaintiffs to <span style="">con</span>tinue in the performance of their
respective duties."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, Salvador L. Marino was substituted in lieu of <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, as one of the
defendants herein, the former having meanwhile assumed the office of Executive
Secretary, which the latter vacated upon his appointment as Ambassador of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants maintained that the principal issue in this case
"is whether or not the plaintiffs are occupying positions which are
primarily confidential and, therefore, are subject to removal at the pleasure
of the appointing power," and that this issue should be resolved in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court did so,
with the result already adverted to.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> thus assume that
an officer holding a position which is primarily confidential in nature is
"subject to removal at the pleasure of the appointing power." This
assumption is inaccurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
evidently based upon a statement in De <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect that "three specified cases of positions -
policy-determining, primarily confidential and highly technical - are excluded
from the merit system and <u>dis</u><u><span style="">missal
at pleasure of officers and employees appointed there</span>in </u><u><span style="">is allowed by the </span>Constitution</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This was, however, a mere obiter, because the office involved in said case -
that of City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> - did not belong to
any of the excepted classes, and, hence, it was not necessary <span class="GramE">to</span> determine whether its incumbents were removable or not at
the pleasure of the appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, said obiter, if detached from the context of the decision
of which it forms part, would be inconsistent with the constitutional command
to the effect that "no officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be
removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and it is conceded that one holding in the Government a primarily <span class="GramE">confidential</span> position <u>is</u> "in the Civil Service."
In fact, in the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos case, this Court cited
with approval the view, expressed in <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> vs.
Romero<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
to the effect "that officers or employees in the unclassified" - to
which plaintiffs herein admittedly belong - "as well as <span class="GramE">those</span>
in the classified service <u>are</u> protected by the above cited provision of
the organic law."</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the law alluded to in the Constitution, namely Section 32
of Republic Act No. 2260, <span class="GramE">provides</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 32.</span> <span class="GramE">Disciplinary
Action.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No officer or employee
in the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause as provided
by law and after due process; Provided, That a transfer from one position to
another without reduction in rank or salary shall not be considered
disciplinary when made in the interest of public service; Provided, further,
That no complaint against a civil service official or employee shall be given
due course unless the same is in writing and subscribed and sworn to by the
complainant; And provided, finally, That the respondent shall be entitled to a
formal investigation if he so elects, in which case he shall have the right to
appear and defend himself at said investigation in person or by counsel, to
confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, and to have the
attendance of witnesses and production of documents in his favor by compulsory
process of <u>subpoena</u> or <u>subpoena</u> <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This should not be misunderstood as denying that the incumbent of
a primarily confidential position holds office at the pleasure only of the
appointing power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted,
however, that when such pleasure turns into displeasure, the incumbent is <u>not</u>
"removed" or dismissed" from office - his "term"
merely "<u>expires</u>," in much the same way as an officer, whose
right thereto ceases upon expiration of the fixed term for which he had been
appointed or elected, is <u>not</u> and can <u>not</u> be deemed "<u>removed</u>"
or "<u>dismissed</u>" <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, upon the
expiration of said term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main
difference between the former - the primarily confidential officer - and the
latter is that the latter's term is fixed or definite, whereas that of the
former is not pre-fixed, but indefinite, at the time of his appointment or election,
and becomes fixed and determined when the appointing power expresses its
decision to put an end to the services of the incumbent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this event takes place, the latter is <u>not</u>
"<u>removed</u>" or "<u>dismissed</u>" from office - his
term has merely "<u>expired</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">As we had occasion to point out in <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Quitoriano</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
"to <u>remove</u> an officer is to oust him from office <u>before the
expiration of his term</u>." Accordingly, we held therein that the
abolition of <span class="SpellE">Manalang's</span> office as Director of the
Placement Bureau by a legislation drafted by him, creating the "National
Employment Service," was <u>not</u> a "removal" from office and
did not violate the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
right to hold said office of Director of the Placement Bureau had merely been <u>extinguished</u>
in consequence of its abolition, in the same manner that it could have come to
an end, <u>without</u> removal, through abandonment of office, retirement of
the incumbent, or his reaching the statutory age limit, if any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, after making the statement relied upon
by respondents herein, regarding the power to dismiss at pleasure officers
holding policy-determining, primarily confidential and highly technical
positions, this Court added, in the aforementioned case of De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
that "it may truly be said that the good of the service itself demands
that appointments coming under this category be <u>terminable</u> at the will
of the officer that makes them."</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the nature of the positions held by plaintiffs herein,
the lower, court would seem to have been impressed by the fact that their items
form part of the budget for 1961-1962 for "The President's Private
Office," under subdivision (a) thereof entitled "Private
Secretaries"; that they handled "confidential matters"; and
that, "while plaintiffs perform purely clerical work, the papers handled
by them are highly confidential in nature."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it appears that the aforementioned
sub-division (a) consisted of the following items:</p>

characterize their "<u>positions</u>" as <u>primarily</u>
confidential." Indeed, it is admitted that plaintiffs, likewise, handle
"other routine matters," and it has not even been shown that their
work is, at least, <u>principally</u> confidential.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, physicians handle confidential matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judges, fiscals and court stenographers
generally handle matters of similar nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Presiding and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals sometimes

nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Officers of the Department of

confidential in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that plaintiffs herein are admittedly civil service <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>, with several years of service in the Government,
