				<BR><STRONG>MAKASIAR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rodolfo Bermudez was accused of having violated paragraph 3 of
P.D. No. <span style="">9, </span>in an information
alleging:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about 10:30 A.M. on the 28th day of December 1975,
at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously possess, carry and
have in his custody outside of his residence one (1) sharp pointed bolo measuring
9 3/4 inches long including handle which is <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of said Presidential Decree."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Convicting said accused
as charged, the lower court sentenced him to suffer an imprisonment "of
from FIVE (5) to TEN (10) YEARS, with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,"
and ordered the bolo confiscated in favor of the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From this decision, the petitioner appealed to the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the brief filed by
petitioner herein before the Court of Appeals (therein defendant-appellant),
the following statement of facts was made:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the morning of <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="12">December
 28, 1975</st1:date> during the town fiesta the accused-appellant in group of
five namely Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> and one were in their way to the basketball court,
when suddenly the accused saw a bolo in <span style="">a
</span>sheath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">bolo
look</span> similar to the bolo of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> so he
picked and kept it and placed on his waistline.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he saw Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>, he draw the bolo with
intention to show it to him and inquiring whether it belongs to him but he
answered no, so he intended to surrender the same to the barrio captain but at
that precise moment <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
grabbed and got hold of the bolo and ran away x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, therein plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
(respondent herein) made a counterstatement of facts, which follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="12">December 28,
 1975</st1:date>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> was celebrating its
barrio fiesta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 a.m.</st1:time> on the same day, appellant Rodolfo
Bermudez was in the company of Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and
three (3) other persons near the vicinity of the church in the said
barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant was then making
trouble and challenging all the people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Suddenly, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>, who was also in the said vicinity in his capacity as
member of the officials of the Barrio Home Defense Unit saw the appellant
drawing a bolo and in the act of injuring Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he immediately rushed at the appellant and
grabbed the latter's bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
police authorities arrived about four (4) hours later, he turned over to them
the said bolo."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Substantially adopting the foregoing counter-statement of facts
by therein plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, respondent Court of
Appeals rendered a decision affirming with modification the decision of the
lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the Court of Appeals decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
view of the equities of the case and in the exercise of judicial discretion
consonant with the principle that imposition of the absolute minimum penalty
prescribed by <span style="">a </span>special law is
not <span style="">a </span>contravention of the
Indeterminate Sentence Law (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Nang</span> Kay, 88
Phil. 515) the judgment of the trial court is hereby modified to the end that
the appellant be, as he is hereby, sentenced to suffer the straight penalty of
five (5) years imprisonment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration
which was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the present
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Presented for Our consideration are two issues, the discussion of
the first of which would suffice <span style="">for <span class="GramE">Us</span> to grant the petitioner's plea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first issue raised by
the petitioner is whether or not conviction for violation of Presidential
Decree No. 9, paragraph 3, requires that the carrying of the prohibited weapons
be connected with the crimes of rebellion, subversion, insurrection, lawless
violence, chaos, or disorder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even a cursory perusal of
Presidential Decree No. 9 would reveal that said </span>decree <span style="">was handed down by the President for some
very definitive purposes -- which <span class="GramE">We</span> quote hereunder
for ready reference:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREAS, </span>pursuant
to Proclamation No. 1081 dated <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="9">September
 21, 1972</st1:date>, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has been placed under a gate of martial law;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREAS, </span>by
virtue of said Proclamation No. 1081, General Order No. 6 dated <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1972</st1:date> and General Order
No. 7 dated <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1972</st1:date>,
have been promulgated by me;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREAS, </span>subversion,
rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality, chaos and public disorder
mentioned in the aforesaid Proclamation No. 1081 are committed and abetted by
the use of firearms, explosives and other deadly weapons;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, Commander-in-Chief of
all the Armed Forces of the Philippines, in order to attain the desired result
of the aforesaid Proclamation No. 1081 and General Orders Nos. 6 and 7, do
hereby order and decree that:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unlawful to carry outside of residence
any bladed, pointed or blunt weapon, such as '<span class="SpellE">fanknife</span>,'
'spear,' 'dagger,' 'bolo,' '<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>,' 'barong,' '<span class="SpellE">kris</span>,' or club, except where such articles are being used
as necessary tools or implements to earn a livelihood and while used in
connection therewith, and any person found guilty thereof shall suffer the
penalty of imprisonment ranging from five to ten years as a Military Court
/Tribunal/ Commission may direct."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing stated
purposes of Presidential Decree No. 9 leave no room for doubt that indeed said
Decree is one of those issued by the President to further the ends for which Martial
Law was declared, that </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">to repel, or at least to prevent the spread
of rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, sedition, criminality, chaos and
public disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the <u>raison
<span class="SpellE">d'etre</span></u> for P.D. No. 9 is primarily linked with
the political purposes for which Proclamation No. 1081 was proclaimed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The recent case of <span class="SpellE">Abril</span> vs. People (L-46265, Feb. 28, 1978) would serve to
enlighten us in this respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
stated thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It can safely be stated here that P.D. 9 was issued by His Excellency,
the President of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as an offshoot of Procla­mation No. 1081, otherwise known <span style="">as </span>the Martial Law Proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Proclamation No. 1081 was declared by
the President in view of the situation then attending in our country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there was reason of primary
national interest which led to the said proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to add more teeth to <span style="">the same, </span>the President issued <span style="">Presidential </span>Decree No. 9 which was to
repel rebellion, insurrection and sedition then becoming widespread in this
country or to prevent at least the further spread of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that, it can be said and admitted that the
issuance of PD 9 was based on Proclamation No. 1081."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this light, an element
surfaces as essential for conviction under PD No. 9 ("3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is <span style="">unlawful to carry outside of residence any bladed, pointed or blunt
weapon, such as '<span class="SpellE">fanknife</span>,' 'spear,' 'dagger,'
'bolo,’ ‘<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>,' 'barong,' '<span class="SpellE">kris</span>,'
or club, except where such articles are being used as necessary tools or implements
to earn a livelihood and while used in connection therewith, any person found
guilty thereof shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment ranging from five to
ten years as a Military Court /Tribunal/ Commission may direct.") -- and
that is, that the carrying of the prohibited weapon was made in connection with
the crime of subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence,
criminality, chaos and public disorder mentioned in Proclamation No. 1081,
considering the penalty attached thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Absent this essential element as in this case, an acquittal must follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this case, the record
reveals that when state witness <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo from the accused Rodolfo Bermudez on
the morning of December 28, 1975 during the barrio fiesta, said accused was
not, in any way, involved in any unlawful act of criminality, and more so, in
any act of rebellion, subversion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality
and public disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was
merely in the act of showing the bolo to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>
(or Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>) since the former thought it to be
the same bolo owned by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Government witness <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
was ignorant of these events, which is apparent from his own testimony, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing testimony
belies the finding of the respondent Court that before <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
rushed at the <span class="GramE">accused,</span> the former suddenly saw the
latter in the act of drawing a bolo and injuring Jorge </span><span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">his testimony, <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
denied knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> intention in
drawing the bolo from its scabbard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
did not know whether the accused was merely showing the bolo to <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just saw from a distance of 25 yards the
accused drawing the bolo in front of <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the accused
wanted to assault <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>),
he could have done so before <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> could reach him
from 25 yards away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> statement, therefore, that he picked up the bolo
to show it to Rodolfo (or Jorge) <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> is more
tenable, corroborated as it is by the testimony of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>
(or Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>) who declared that the accused
merely asked him whether the bolo found by the accused belongs to him (<span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> or <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>) [<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 63-64, hearing of June 28, 1976].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

28, 1975, while the barrio people were in the barrio church, he saw the accused
Rodolfo Bermudez (husband of his daughter) holding a bolo facing somebody else;
that he went near them and confiscated the bolo from his son-in-law, the
accused therein, whom he pulled away from the crowd and advised to keep quiet;
that when the accused did not heed his advice, he let him go; that he did not
return the bolo because as a retired soldier, he knows that the accused has
violated the law; that because he did not return the bolo to the accused, the
latter threatened him by saying "there will be a time for you" and
thereafter went away; that soon after Patrolman Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Bringas</span>
arrived; that he handed to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Bringas</span> the bolo
he confiscated from the accused; that <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Valera</span> and many other persons were present when the
incident happened; that Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> was the
companion of the accused who was creating trouble and challenging all the
people who panicked; that the bolo he confiscated from the accused was
sharp-pointed about 9-3/4 inches long, including its handle and wooden
scabbard; that he did not know the person whom the accused was "charging
on" when he was holding the bolo; that the accused was then facing Rudy <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> (referring to George <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>)
and many others whom he can no longer remember; and that nobody was wounded
during the incident (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C, Translation, p. 2,

<p class="BODY">In his testimony in court, state witness <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>

December 28, 1975, he saw about 25 yards away the accused Rodolfo Bermudez
about two meters from the barrio chapel drawing a knife in front of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> (obviously referring to George <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>,
nicknamed Rudy) in the company of five other persons including Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>; that he immediately proceeded to the accused from
whom he confiscated the bolo; that when he approached the accused the bolo was
already half-drawn from its scabbard (Exhibits A &amp; A-1); that he does not
know why the accused drew the bolo half-way; that after seizing the bolo from
the accused, he counseled him after which the police force arrived; that he
gave the bolo to policeman Felipe <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>; that the
accused is from <span class="SpellE">Tayum</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>
and resides about 500 yards from the chapel of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>; that he does
not know that the accused herein, his son-in-law, is a friend of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> (referring to George <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>);
that there were many people in the vicinity of the incident; that he did not
know whether the accused then was showing the bolo to him; that he did not
inquire as to who owned the bolo, but that after the crowd dispersed, he asked
the accused who answered that the bolo is his; that Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> was still with the accused after he confiscated the
bolo from the latter, but Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> also left
when the crowd dispersed, although Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
accompanied the accused to his (<span class="SpellE">Acena's</span>) house to
talk with him about the incident; that after getting the bolo from the accused,
he immediately left the area because the accused and his companions were
challenging him to a fight; that only the accused followed him to his house to
get the bolo from him to be used in killing a pig; that after two hours the
accused went to his (<span class="SpellE">Acena's</span>) house asking for the
bolo; that he told the accused that he will keep the bolo until everything is
over; that he kept the bolo for about three hours inside his dresser until the
arrival of the police force to whom he surrendered the bolo; that the
companions of the accused challenged him to a fight because he refused to
return the bolo; and that <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> did not run away
although he did not see him in the place of the incident after he got the bolo
from the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">When he was recalled to the witness stand, state witness <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> further stated that as a member of the Civilian Home
Defense Force and as a citizen, he was authorized to arrest any person who
commits a crime in his presence; and that he reported the incident to the
barrio captain and the PC Commander, but he did not state whether he
investigated the incident or the circumstances giving rise thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Policeman Felipe <span class="SpellE">Bello</span> testified that
he was at the municipal building of <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> when a certain Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Brilliantes</span>,
the head teacher of <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span> Elementary School,
reported to him the trouble that took place in barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>
in the morning of December 28, 1975; that together with patrolmen Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Bringas</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Marilag</span>, he
proceeded on a jeep to and reached said barrio about 12 o'clock noon; that he
went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
who surrendered the bolo to him telling him that he (<span class="SpellE">Acena</span>)
confiscated the bolo from the accused Rodolfo Bermudez; that he issued to <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> a receipt for the bolo; that upon his query, <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> told him that he did not know where the accused had
run away; and that they looked vainly for the accused in the vicinity of the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, the accused presented his testimony and those of
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>,
and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused Rodolfo Bermudez testified on July 16, 1976 that he
was 24 years old (now 26), married and a farmer and resident of Barrio Velasco,
<span class="SpellE">Tayug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>; that in the
morning of December 28, 1975, he was walking on the road going towards the
basketball court of barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, together with
Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
and two others; that he went to the house of Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
before proceeding to the basketball court; that on the way, he saw a bolo which
he picked up, despite the advice of Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
not to pick it up as it might work against him later on; that he picked up the
bolo because it appeared similar to the bolo of Jorge (or George) <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>, one of his defense witnesses and his good friend;
that he saw Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> near the church that morning;
that he placed the bolo on his waistline; that when he saw Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> at the basketball court he showed the bolo to him and
asked him whether it was his and Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> replied
that it was not his, he told <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> that he had to
surrender the same or to any member of the barrio council; that the basketball
court is about 80 to 100 meters from where he first saw him (Jorge) near the
church; that when he showed the bolo to <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>,
Cornelio and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> were with him; that
after he showed the bolo to <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>, he was about to
deliver the bolo to Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, barrio councilman
of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span> who was approaching them when
his father-in-law <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>,
state witness, came from behind him and took the bolo from him; that after <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo
from him, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> and some people nearby ran away
leaving only Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> with them; that after
grabbing the bolo from him <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> pointed a gun at him asking him who owns the bolo,
adding "<span class="SpellE">shet</span>"; that thereafter <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> left together with
his wife (the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> mother-in-law); that after <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> left, barrio
councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> asked him why <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo in
his (Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe's</span>) presence; that councilman Romeo
<span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> told him that they will get the bolo to
butcher chickens and a pig and that he will deliver the bolo to him (the
accused) for him to turn over the same to the barrio captain; that thereafter
he and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> to get the bolo;
that when they tried to get the bolo from <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>, an altercation ensued between <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
in the yard of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
fronting the road; that during the altercation between <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buena­fe</span>
there were plenty of people passing along the road because it was then a barrio
fiesta; that the passers­-by stopped and listened to the verbal exchange
between <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> and
Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> and ran away when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> tried to rush at
him and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>; that his wife Aurelia <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> is the daughter of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>; that during the altercation between <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, he just listened and did not utter any word
because he did not have the temerity to answer his father-in-law <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>; that when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> got the bolo from
him while in front of the barrio chapel, he did not make any protest because he
considered <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> as
his own father; that he was not even able to tell <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> that he was surrendering the bolo to barrio
councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buena­fe</span> because <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> just grabbed the bolo from him; that the place
where he picked up the bolo was about 30 to 35 meters from the place where he
showed the bolo to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>; that they went direct
to him from the place where he picked up the bolo; that he was wearing a shirt
then as he was going to play basketball; that <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> smelt of liquor when he (<span class="SpellE">Acena</span>)
grabbed the bolo from him; that <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> filed the complaint of illegal possession of deadly
weapon and the charge of public scandal against him because <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> did not like him to marry his daughter,
possibly because of his poverty; that he paid a fine for public scandal because
he wanted the case to be terminated as he was ashamed of a case existing
between him and his father-in-law; that he was not able to tell his
father-in-law that he just picked up the bolo because his father-in-law
appeared suddenly and took the bolo away from him and soon after his mother-in-law
took him (<span class="SpellE">Acena</span>) away and brought him to their house;
that thereafter he was not able to tell his father-in-law that he just picked
up the bolo on the road because he was afraid to go to their house as he was
informed that his father-in-law would kill him; that he was never investigated
by the authorities because of the incident; that he learned of this case only
when he was arrested on February 27, 1976; that the bolo Exhibit "A"
together with its scabbard, Exhibit "A-1", is not the same as the
bolo he picked up because the bolo he picked up was smaller than Exhibit
"A" and that the scabbard is made of leather unlike Exhibit
"A-1" which is made of wood; that he did not have any intention to
own the bolo which he picked up; that he was the only one who picked up the
bolo despite the many people walking along the same road where he found it;
that he tucked the bolo in his waistline but still visible; that he did not
have any intention to stab Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> with the bolo;
that when he brought out the bolo the people near Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>
did not run; that he was not able to tell his father-in-law <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> that he picked up the bolo after <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed it from him because <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
pointed a gun at him -- a .22 caliber magnum; that he reported the fact that <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> pointed a gun at
him to the persons in the cadre who told him to settle the case between
themselves since <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
is his father-in-law and they belong to the same family and that when the case
will not be settled be­tween him and his father-in-law, they <span style="">advised </span>him to return to the cadre so
that they will help him settle the case; that his statement was taken down in
writing; that he has no copy of his statement or report; that he did not insist
in filing a case against his father-in-law <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> because he considers him as his own father, being the
father of his wife; that while the other persons in the vicinity may not have
seen his father-in-law pointing a gun at him because they ran away after <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo
from him, Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> did see; that three days
after the incident, he told barrio captain Emilio <span class="SpellE">Bigornia</span>
that he just picked up the bolo which was grabbed by <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span>, when he and barrio captain <span class="SpellE">Bigornia</span>
talked by chance near their place because the barrio captain learned of the
incident but he did not purposely go to the barrio captain to report the matter
to him; that he and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> were sent to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> to
get the bolo from him because it will be used in butchering a pig, not of their
own volition but because Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> sent them for
said purpose; that the altercation between <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> was
due to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
uttered many words which provoked Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> to
answer back; that when he was showing the bolo to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>
before <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
grabbed it from him councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> was
about six meters away; that the barrio captain did not like to accompany him to
his father-in-law to tell him that he just picked up the bolo; that people told
him that his father-in-law will kill him if he goes to him; and that his own
wife told him that his father-in-law did not like any person to be presented to
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
testified on August 2, 1976 that he was then 28 years old, single, laborer and
resident of barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span>; that in the morning of December 28, 1975, his
four friends including the accused Rodolfo Bermudez fetched him from his house
and they proceeded to the basketball court to play basketball near the barrio
school; that on the way to the basketball court they saw a bolo on the road
which the accused picked up, in spite of his warning not to do so because the
bolo might work against him; that the accused replied that the bolo appeared to
be similar to the bolo of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>; that as they
continued walking towards the basketball court, the accused was looking for
Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> who was about five meters away and whom
he believed to be the owner of the bolo, when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo from the accused while they
were about 75 meters from the chapel with only a few persons near them; that
when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed
the bolo from the accused causing the people around to scamper, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> said that it was not his bolo; that councilman <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> told the accused to get the bolo and surrender it
to him; that the place where the accused picked up the bolo is about 150 to 170
meters from the place near the church where <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo from the accused; that soon after <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo
from the accused, the wife of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> took him home; that obeying the orders of barrio
councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, he and Rodolfo Bermudez
went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
to get the bolo to be used in butchering a pig; that there were many people
passing by when he was trying to get the bolo from <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span>; that the passers-by gathered around and
listened to the exchange of words between him and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span>; that, thinking that they were quarreling, the
passers-by ran away; that the accused Rodolfo Bermudez left when he (<span class="SpellE">Buena­fe</span>) was trying to get the bolo from <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>; that he also left
after the passers-by ran away; that the bolo marked Exhibit "A" is
not the bolo which was picked up by the accused because the bolo the accused
picked up was shorter and had a leather scabbard; that the barrio road was
about three meters wide; that the accused showed the bolo to the people in the
vicinity to find out who <span style="">owns </span>it;
that when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
from behind, grabbed the bolo from the accused, a scandal was created by him
and the accused, to which charge they both pleaded guilty and paid a fine
because they did not like any trouble; that the scandal might have <span class="SpellE">occured</span> at the time he and the accused went to the house of
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> to get the bolo upon instruction of barrio
councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> which gave rise to an
altercation between him and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>; that the altercation was due to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> did not like to
give the bolo which they wanted to use for butchering a pig; that during the
latter part of his altercation with <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>, the accused left; that after butchering the pig with
the bolo they would surrender the bolo to barrio councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>, who told them to surrender the same to him after
butchering <span style="">a </span>pig; that at the
time the accused picked up the bolo lying on the road, he said that the bolo <span style="">is </span>similar to the bolo of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>, after he advised the accused not to pick it up or it
might later involve him; that when they saw Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>
two meters away, barrio councilman Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> was
about five meters from them; and that he was about three meters behind the
accused and Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> when the accused showed the
bolo to <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> declared
that he was 32 years old (on June 28, 1976), married, farmer, barrio councilman
of barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>, and member of Civilian Home
Defense Force (CHDF) and resident of said barrio; that about 10:35 in the
morning of December 28, 1975, he was near the barrio church with his companions
waiting for the mass to start; that the accused Rodolfo Bermudez showed <span style="">a </span>bolo to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span>;
that being a barrio councilman, he thought it was his duty to take the bolo but
that was the time when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>,
the father-in-law of the accused arrived; that he was informed that the accused
found a bolo on the barrio road; that the accused was about to give him the
bolo when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
grabbed it; that the accused had five other companions; that the accused obeyed
him when he told him to go with his father-in-law; that he was not able to do
anything because the bolo was already taken by <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> but he was able to tell the accused why his
father-in-law did that to him; that the accused and his father-in-law are not
in good terms because his father-in-law does not like the accused; that the
accused is not notorious and has been conducting himself properly; that it was
only in the morning of the trial that day when the accused requested him to
testify in his defense; that the wife of the accused is his niece by a second
degree cousin; that the head teacher of the barrio elementary school reported
to the municipal building the trouble of a commotion caused by the possession
of the bolo; that the accused and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
did not create the trouble; that he does not know that the accused and Cornelio
<span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> were charged with public scandal in the
municipal court; that the accused took the bolo from his waist because he was
looking for its owner; that he came to testify to tell the truth; that the
people thought that there was trouble when the accused showed the bolo to Jorge
<span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> although actually there was no trouble; that he
is not sure whether Exhibits "A" and "A-1" are the same
bolo and its scabbard; that he had no chance to hold the bolo; that he was
about five meters from the accused when the latter drew the bolo from his
waist; and that he wanted to approach the accused because he was looking for
the owner of the bolo but that before he could reach him, the father-in-law of
the accused grabbed the bolo from behind.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Jorge (George) <span class="SpellE">Tuzon</span> testified that he is 23 years old (on June 28, 1976),
married, farmer and resident of barrio <span class="SpellE">Macarcarmay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>; that he knows the
accused when he married the daughter of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>, a resident of the barrio, and thereafter they became
friends; that about 10 o'clock in the morning of December 28, 1975, he was
sitting near the chapel with his "<span class="SpellE">barkada</span>"
and listening </span>to barrio councilman <span style="">Romeo
<span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span> </span>conversing <span style="">with other people; that there were many persons then because it was a
barrio fiesta; that the accused, with Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
and other </span>friends, came to their place asking who was the owner of the
bolo which he drew from his waist; that when the accused told them that he was
going to surrender the bolo to the barrio councilman, his father-in-law <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> from behind grabbed
the bolo from him; that after grabbing the bolo <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> left; that he does not know of any quarrel
between the accused and his father-in-law then; that when <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Acena</span> grabbed the bolo from the accused, he and the
others ran away because they were afraid; that he does not know whether there
was any trouble created by the accused and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Buenafe</span>
because he was no longer in the vicinity after <span class="SpellE">Acena</span>
seized the bolo from the accused; that Exhibits "A" and
"A-1" are not similar to the bolo and the scabbard grabbed by <span class="SpellE">Acena</span> from the accused because the scabbard found by the
accused was made of leather; that he was about one meter from the accused when
the latter showed him the bolo and asked him whether the bolo was his; that he

give rise to the inference that he was then a participant in subversive
