				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> Tan, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> Mercado and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Yellow
Taxi (Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Checkered Cab Co., Inc.) from a decision of the Public Service Commission
granting Antonio de <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> a certificate of Public
convenience to operate fifteen (15) units of taxicabs within the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants maintain that said decision should be reversed
because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Mrs. Tan has been denied
due process; and (b) said decision was rendered without evidence to reason­ably
support its finding that there is public necessity for the operation of said
fifteen (15) units.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first question, the record shows that, on or
about May 27, 1963, De <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> filed with the PSC, in
Manila an application for authority to operate twenty-five (25) units of
taxicabs in the Island of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, or on July 31, 1963, the PSC
issued a notice setting said application for <span style="">hearing on October </span>1, 1962, and requiring all affected operators
to file their oppositions thereto, if any, on or before the latter date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> Mercado and the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Yellow Taxi (Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Checkered Cab Co., Inc.) filed their respective
oppositions in due time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The opposition of Mrs.
Tan was sent by registered mail in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span style=""> to the PSC in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before it reached its destination, or on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="10"><span style="">October 4, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, the PSC had issued an order commissioning
the Municipal Judge of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> to receive such evidence as the parties may
wish to present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as Mrs. Tan's
opposition had not, as yet, been received in the office of the PSC in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, she was not notified of this order, which,
seemingly, did not mention her among the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
to De <span class="SpellE">Pio's</span> application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, neither did the Commissioner cause to
be served upon Mrs. Tan official notice of the first hearing scheduled to be
held in </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="11"><span style="">November 4, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, although De <span class="SpellE">Pio's</span>
counsel stated, under oath, that he had personally notified her counsel of said
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further hearings were held on
November 7, 15 and 18, 1963, of which Mrs. Tan was not, for the same reason,
notified officially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of
these hearings De <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> introduced documentary and
testimonial evi­dence, whereas <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, Mercado and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Yellow
Taxi (Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Checkered
Cab Co., Inc.) presented their own witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence, the only </span><span style="">is­</span><span style="">sue
raised before and resolved by the PSC was whether or </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">there is</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">public necessity for the taxicab service
applied for, which, on December 4, 1963, the PSC decided in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, or on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="1"><span style="">January
 8, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, Mrs. Tan
filed </span><span style="">her
</span><span style="">petition for review with this
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
Mrs. Tan has not asked the PSC for, either a reconsideration of its
aforementioned deci­sion, or a new trial to present her evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has she stated in her petition for
review before us, what evidence, if any, she would introduce, should a new
trial be held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record before us is
thus absolutely devoid of any indicia that would justify a reasonable belief or
expectation or even the </span><span style="">hope, </span><span style="">that the outcome of the case would be </span><span style="">otherwise, if </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">new trial were held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being
no showing that Mrs. </span><span style="">Tan </span><span style="">has suffered any substantial injury, she has
no </span><span style="">cause
</span><span style="">for complaint in this appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Needless to say, the other <span class="SpellE">op­positors</span> can not even claim a denial of due process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the second
issue the decision </span><span style="">appealed </span><span style="">from has the
following to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although the applicant had only two wit­nesses and the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, six, nevertheless the Commission finds that the
weight of evi­dence preponderates in favor of the applicant's stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the criteria or yardstick used by the
Commission in weighing the oral tes­timony is not the quantity of witnesses
produced but by the quality of the state­ments adduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that four of the six
witnesses of <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> were drivers or employees of
said <span class="SpellE">oppo­sitors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, we find their testimony without such evidentiary value bec<span style="">ause the same is not completely free from
bias.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise we <span class="SpellE">canot</span>
give much weight to the testimony of the </span>two other <span style="">witnesses of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
that </span>it is <span style="">not hard to get a
taxicab in the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
statement is more of a con­jecture </span>than a <span style="">product of their own actual experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For both of them testified that in </span><span style="">going </span><span style="">from one point to
another in the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">they invariably take a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
or a rig </span>and only </i><i style=""><span style="">rarely do they ride in a taxicab</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They were not even<span style=""> sure that the vacant taxicabs they claim­ed
to have seen running around were look­ing for passengers or actually answering </span>phone
calls of prospective passengers, nor were <span style="">they
certain that the vacant taxicabs they have seen parked were waiting for </span>passengers
<span style="">or merely parked because of engine
trouble or their drivers merely taking a brief rest.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this point, we wish to emphasize <span style="">the fact that the </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">oppositors</span></i></span><i><span style="">'
witnesses themselves testified to the existence </span></i><i><span style="">of </span></i><i><span style="">'<span class="SpellE">Colorum</span>' cars illegally competing with
authorized taxicabs for passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><span style="">This, </span></i><i><span style="">in itself, is a tangible indication of an existing</span></i><span style=""> </span>demand for <span style="">means of transporta</span>tion other than <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>
or rigs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, these same witnesses
testified that there are eight or nine taxicab operators actually operating in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
although the records of the Commission show that there are eleven authorized to
operate a combined total of 273 units of these, however, about ten to twenty
per cent are not in actual <span style="">operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly, our re<span style="">cords show that </span><i><span style="">the
last application for additional taxicab units in </span></i><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Cebu</span></i></span></st1:placename><i><span style=""> </span></i><st1:placetype><i><span style="">City</span></i></st1:placetype></st1:place><i><span style=""> was granted way back in November of 1960 or
more than three years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
within that period of time </span></i><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Cebu</span></i></span></st1:place><i><span style=""> must have expanded in population and
business ac</span></i><i><span style="">tivity</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Premises considered<span class="GramE">,</span> we find that there
is an existing public necessity for the service herein applied for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consider­ing that applicant has assets worth
about P360,000.00 plus a yearly income of about P15,500.00 and P45,000.00 ready
cash available for immediate investment; that he has a repair shop ready for
use; that he has had experience as a common carrier operator; that the Delta
Motors Corporation, distributor of <span class="SpellE">Toyopet</span> cars in
the Philippines, has already agreed to supply him with the necessary units;
that he already has the necessary personnel to implement the ser­vice applied
for, the Commission believes that public convenience would best be pro­moted if
we grant to the applicant herein fifteen (15) units only instead of the
twenty-five (25) herein applied for."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The testimonial and </span>documentary
<span style="">evidence introduced </span>in this case
substantially bear out the foregoing findings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. Tan impugns the veracity of the testimonial evidence for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> De <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>; but, in a
petition for review, like the one at bar, this Court will not disturb the
findings of the PSC on the credibility of witnesses, so long as their version
is <span style="">not inherently improbable, which is
not the one before </span>us.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the decision appealed from should </span>be
as it is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants herein.</p>
