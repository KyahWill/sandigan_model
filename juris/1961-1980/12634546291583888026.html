				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a letter dated January 9, 1961 petitioner, who was engaged in
the manufacture of embroidery and apparel products for the purpose of
exportation, using imported raw materials and doing business under the style
"El Barato Alce Company", was authorized by the Collector of Customs,
pursuant to the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code (RA 1937 1937)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a> to
operate a manufacturing bonded warehouse located at Santolan, Tenejeros,
Malabon, Rizal, known as Manufacturing Bonded Warehouse No. 88.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of such authority petitioner
imported raw materials exempt from duty and proceeded to manufacture them into
finished products for export under the terms and conditions required and
specified in the letter-authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on June 17, 1961 Republic Act No. 3137 was enacted,
creating "an embroidery and apparel control and inspection board covering
control, issuance of entry permits, and inspection of conditionally tax-free
raw material importations by local embroidery apparel manufacturers and the
corresponding liquidation of re-exporta­tions thereof as Philippine-made
embroideries and apparels.”</p>

<p class="BODY">SECS. 1 and 2 of said Act provide:<span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No textile,
leather gloves raw materials and/or supplies, of any kind relative thereto, may
be imported into the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as consigned goods to duly registered and organized Philippine embroidery and
apparel firms without the necessary license issued in accordance with the
provisions of this Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
license required hereof under Section One of this Act shall be duly issued by
an Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection Board which is hereby created
and hereinafter referred to as the Board, composed of: (1) A representa­tive
from the Bureau of Customs to act as Chairman, to be designated by the
Secretary of Finance; (2) A representative from the Central Bank to be
designated by its Gover­nor; (3) A representative from the Depart­ment of
Commerce and Industry to be de­signated by the Secretary of Commerce and
Industry; (4) A representative from the National Economic. Council to be
designated by its Chairman; (5) A representative from the private sector coming
from the Associa­tion of Embroidery and Apparel Exporters of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board shall have the over-all control and
shall administer the checks and counter-checks of consigned textile, leather
gloves raw materials and/or supplies to embroidery and apparel manufacturers
and corresponding counter­checks for liquidations of said goods prior to
re-exportations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other govern­ment
instrumentality or agency shall be authorized to qualify or question the
validity of license so issued by the Board questions of legality and
interpretation of any license so issued shall be decided exclusively by the
Board subject to appeal to courts of competent jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In compliance with these
provisions the Apparel Control and Inspection Board (hereinafter referred to as
the Board) was subsequently Constituted with the representative from the Bureau
of Customs as Chairman and the</span> representatives from the Central Bank,
the Department of Commerce and Industry, and the National Economic Council as
members, each of them having been previously designated by their respective
depart­ment heads.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon recommendation of the Philippine Association of Embroidery
and Apparel Exporters, Inc., the Department of Finance named Quintin Santiago,
association president, as the representative from the private sector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, another organization, the Philippine
Chamber of Embroidery and Apparel Producers, Inc., to which petitioner was
affiliated, questioned the choice of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
apparently because its own nominee to the Board had been rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In upholding its original choice, the Board
made reference to a letter of Senator Alejandro D. Almendras, principal author
of Republic Act 3137, stating that the association referred to in Section 2 of
said Act was none other than the respondent association itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of said letter the Board adopted
on September 15, 1961 Resolution No. 2 (series of 1961) stating "that the
Board entertains no doubt that the P.A.E.A. Inc. is the association referred to
in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 3137 and that it is the only association
entitled to representation in the Board from the private sector."</p>

<p class="BODY">Presumably in the exercise of its powers, the Board, in a
communication dated August 31, 1961, requested peti­tioner to "submit to
(the Board) pertinent data called for in the attached form of application for
license (EACIB Form No. 1) which should be duly accomplished before a notary
public." In the same letter petitioner was "also requested to remit
with the aforementioned application the amount of P200.00 either in cash or in
a check drawn in favor of the Embroidery and Apparel Control Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amount will be charged against
(petitioner's) future assessments as per Sec. 4, par. XVI of Republic Act No.
3137."</p>

<p class="BODY">Unwilling to comply with the Board's request, petitioner filed an
action for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
(Civil Case No. 49087) for the purpose of enjoining or restraining respondents
from enforcing the provisions of Republic Act 3137. More par­ticularly,
petitioner prayed that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending final resolution of the petition for
prohibition on the merits, a writ of preliminary injunction <u>ex</u>-<u>parte</u>
be issued enjoining and restraining respondent Embroidery and Apparel Control
and Inspection Board, the respondent Philip­pine Association of Embroidery and
Apparel Exporters, Inc., and respondent Secretary of Finance from further
enforcing the provisions of Republic Act 3137;</p>

<p class="NUM">“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing on the
merits, a decision be rendered declaring Republic Act No. 3137 unconstitutional
and void<u> ab</u>-<u>initio;</u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, assuming that Republic
Act 3137 is declared valid, it is respectfully prayed that the following acts
be declared null and void because they were done without jurisdiction and
prohibiting the respondents from doing the same or similar act:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">“(a) the act of the
Secretary of Finance administering oath of office to the present members of the
respondent Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection Board;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">“(b) the act of the
Chairman of respondent Embroidery and Apparel Control and Inspection Board
requiring petitioner to pay P200.00 as condition precedent to the filing of
petitioner's applica­tion for a license without stating the actual extent of
petitioner's liability thereunder;</p>

<p class="2Q">x x x "</p>

<p class="BODY">Primarily on the basis of documentary evidence presented by the
contending parties, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1962</st1:date>, the dispositive
portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court renders judgment –</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a) declaring Section 2 of Republic Act No. 3137
unconstitutional;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b) declaring the respondent Board created pursuant thereto
to be illegally constituted and, therefore, any and all acts and orders done
and/or issued by said respondent are considered null and void;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c) and permanently enjoining respondents from enforcing the
provisions of Section of Republic Act 3137.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The counterclaim filed by the Respondent Philippine
Association of Embroidery and Apparel Exporters, Inc. is hereby dismissed for
insufficiency of evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment both parties appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner maintains that the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> should not have nullified section 2 of Republic Act 3137 alone but
should have declared the entire law null and void; respondents submit, on the
other hand, that the trial court erred in declaring section 2 of the law
invalid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner points to several features of Republic Act 3137 to
support his claim of invalidity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first is found in section 2, providing for the composition of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument is that while Congress may
create an office it cannot specify who shall be appointed therein; that the
members of the Board can only be appointed by the President in accordance with
Article VII, Sec. 10, subsection 3<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">+</span></span></a> of the Constitution; that since the
Act prescribes that the chairman and members of the Board should come from
specified offices, it is equivalent to a declaration by Congress as to who
should be appointed, thereby infringing the constitutional power of the
President to make appoint­ments.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the argument untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An examination of section 2 of the questioned statute reveals that for
the chairman and members of the Board to qualify they need only be designated
by the respective department heads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the exception of the representative from the private sector, they sit <u>ex-officio</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to be designated they must already
be holding positions in the offices mentioned in the law. Thus, for instance,
one who does not hold a previous appointment in the Bureau of Customs cannot,
under the Act, be designated representative from that of­fice. The same is true
with respect to the representatives from the other offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No new appointments are necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is as it should be, because the
representatives so designated merely perform duties in the Board in addition to
those they already perform under their original appoint­ments.</p>

<blockquote>“x x x We do not think that, because additional duties germane to
the offices already held by them were devolved upon them by the Act, it was
necessary that they should be again appointed by the President x x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be doubted, and it has frequently
been the case, that Congress may increase the power and duties of an existing
office without thereby rendering it neces­sary that the incumbent should be
again nominated and appointed." (Shoemaker vs. <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 147 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
170, 185)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as nothing in the Act, nor in the records of the case
for that matter, suggests that the designated representatives to the Board will
lose or forfeit their original appointments in their "parent"
offices, it is evident that for purposes of their tenure on the Board they can
be considered as merely on detail, subject to recall by their respective
chiefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arrangement envisioned in section 2 is in no wise
incompatible with or violative of the established doctrine that "the
appointing power is the exclusive prerogative of the President, upon which no
limitations maybe imposed by Congress, except those resulting from the need of
securing the concurrence of the Commission on Appointments and from the
exercise of the limited power to prescribe the qualifications to a given appoin­tive
office." (Manalang vs. Quitoriano, 94 Phil. 903, 911).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that Congress took care to specify that the
representatives should come from the Bureau of Customs, Central Bank,
Department of Commerce and Industry and the National Economic Council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obvious reason must be because these
departments and/or bureaus perform functions which have a direct relation to the
importation of raw materials, the manufacture thereof into embroidery and
apparel products and their subsequent exportation abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no attempt in Republic Act 3137 to deprive the President
of his power to make appointments, and therefore on this point we rule that the
law is not unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another objection raised by petitioner to the validity of the Act
is that it "constitutes class legis­lation and has deprived (him) of equal
protection of the laws because Congress has vested the appointment of the
representative of the private sector in respondent Board, a private
non-governmental entity." More pointedly, petitioner attacks as null that
part of the statute which requires that "a representative from the private
sector coming from the Association of Embroidery and Apparel Exporters of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
shall sit as a member of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner asserts that this particular provision is designed to favor
one private organization to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent P.A.E.A.E. was not singled out by the law in order to favor
it over and above others, but rather because it is the dominant organization in
the field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law no privileges
are accorded P.A.E.A.E. members which are not similarly given to non-members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both are within the coverage of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Non-membership in the P.A.E.A.E. does not
mean that the benefits granted and the restrictions imposed by the Act shall
not apply to those who choose to venture into the business independently.</p>

<blockquote>"It is a general rule that legislation which affects alike all
persons pursuing the same business under the same conditions is not such class
legislation as is prohibited by constitutional provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discrimination which are open to ob­jections
are those in which persons engaged in the same business are sub­jected to
different privileges under the same conditions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Part of the liberty of a citizen consists in the enjoyment, upon terms
of equality with all others in similar circums­tances, of the privileges of
pursuing an ordinary calling or trade x x x.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The constitutional guarantee as to the equal protection of the laws,
moreover, requires that no impediment should be interposed to the pursuits of
anyone except as applied to the same pursuit by others under similar
circumstances and that no greater burden in engaging in a calling should be
laid upon one than are laid upon others, in the same calling and con­dition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>12 Am. Jur. 187" (cited in Tolentino vs.
Board of Accountancy, et al., 90 Phil. 83)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled rule in constitutional law that legislation which
affects with equal force all persons of the same class and not those of another
is not class legislation and does not infringe the constitutional guarantee of
equal protection of the laws. (Meralco vs. Public Utilities Employees, Assn., 79
Phil. 409)</p>

<p class="BODY">Another objection is addressed to sec. 4, XVI, paragraph 2, of
the Act, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"A special assessment shall be levied upon all persons,
corporations, or firms engaged in the embroidery and apparel manufacturing
industry in an amount to be fixed by the Board not exceeding one percent of the
value of the labor, processing or finishing costs realized from the processed
or finished goods exported.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The funds
collected hereunder shall accrue to the Board and shall be used exclusive­ly
for carrying out its functions and duties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed that this section constitutes an undue delegation
of legislative power because the Act does not provide sufficient standards
under which the Board may base its assessment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The afore-cited
second paragraph has a direct relation to the paragraph immediately preceding
it, which reads: </p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 49.5pt; text-indent: -27.9pt;">"XVI. Notice
of Export Ship­ments.- Every manufacturer who intends to remove manufactured
products for export shall make a written request to the Board for exportation
of the articles intended for removal, <u>giving the kinds, quantity of yardage,
the use gross an net weights, and the value of t articles to be exported</u>
and the number or numbers of Import Entry or entries involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Customs official assigned in the bonded
manufacturing warehouse shall undertake the sampling, inspection and classifica­tion
of the embroidery in accordance with the rules or inspection and control
promulgated by the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A certificate
of inspection shall be issued for every lot of embroidered articles
inspected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of inspection
shall be attached to the application to be ap­proved by the Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discovery of any such article in transit,
in regards to which no notification has been re­ceived by the Board on goods packed
without the presence of the detailed Customs official shall be deemed <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> evidence of the illegal removal of same and shall subject them to
seizure and forfeiture proceedings under the Customs laws." (underscoring
supplied.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently the special assessment referred to in the second
paragraph applies to manufactured products which a manufacturer intends to
remove from the bonded warehouse for exportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from empowering the Board to levy without
sufficient standard, the law sets a reasonable basis under which the special
assessment maybe imposed, to wit: (a) that such special assessment be levied on
manufactured goods intended to be removed for exportation; (b) that such
special assessment should not exceed one percent of the value of the labor,
processing or finishing costs realized from the processed or finished goods
exported.</p>

<p class="BODY">The true distinction between delegation of the power to legislate
and the conferring of authority or dis­cretion as to the execution of the law
consists in that the former necessarily involves a discretion as to what the
law shall be, while in the latter the authority or discretion as to its
execution has to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first cannot be done; to the latter, no
valid objection can be made. (Araneta et al. vs. Gatmaitan, et al., 101 Phil.
328, 346) Tested under this score, We see no valid reason to object to the
validity of Republic Act 3137.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing points relied upon by petitioner constitute the
decisive issues in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our
opinion they should be resolved against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other incidental issue presented, namely,
the lack of appro­priation with which to pay the <u>per</u> <u>diems</u> of the
board members, has no material relevance to the question of constitutionality and
cannot affect the conclusion herein reached.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the judgment appealed from is
hereby reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 3137,
particularly Section 2 thereof, is declared constitutional, and the per­manent
injunction issued by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner-appellant.</p>
