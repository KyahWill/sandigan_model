<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1960</st1:date>
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed his petition for naturalization with
the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the required publication, the court set the petition for hearing <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
started presenting his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
witnesses <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> Valenzuela, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Paloma</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Eliseo</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Vivar</span> testified on <st1:date year="1961" day="13" month="7">July
 13, 1961</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1961</st1:date>
and on May 3 and <st1:date year="1962" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1962</st1:date>,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> himself took the witness stand and after his <span style="">testimony had </span>been taken, he rested
his case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1963</st1:date>
NBI senior agent, Cornelio Nicolas, took the witness stand on behalf of the
State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the next hearing held on May
24, 1963, the representative of the Solicitor General filed <span style="">a </span>motion to recall Manuel <span class="SpellE">Paloma</span>, one of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
character witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was
granted and the Court directed <span class="SpellE">Paloma</span> to appear
before it on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1963</st1:date>
for additional cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because <span class="SpellE">Paloma</span> was not duly notified of this
hearing, the same was transferred to <st1:date year="1963" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This hearing was
likewise cancelled because of <span class="SpellE">Paloma's</span> illness, so
the trial court set the hearing anew on September 20 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1963</st1:date>,
however, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a motion to withdraw his
petition for naturalization, without prejudice on his part to file <span style="">a </span>new one subsequently, on the ground
that the character witnesses he had presented failed to vouch for his character
and attest to the merits of his petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General objected to his motion contending that the hearing
should be completed and final judgment on the merits rendered, or if the
petition was to be dismissed, the dismissal should be with prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding this opposition, the trial
court granted the motion for the withdrawal of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the present appeal, it being claimed by
the State that the lower court erred in allowing the withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> petition for naturalization without prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether to
allow the withdrawal or not, and, in the affirmative, to allow the withdrawal,
with or without prejudice, was <span style="">a matter
</span>addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, and considering that,
even if the case was terminated with a final judgment denying the petition for
naturalization, such final judgment would not constitute a bar to the renewal
of the petition provided <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had in the meantime
acquired all the qualifications and did not have anyone of the
disqualifications provided by law (Yu Lo vs. Republic, <span style="">G. </span>R. No. <span class="GramE">L-4725, </span><st1:date year="1952" day="5" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 5, 1952</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiam</span> vs.

clear that the trial court committed no reversible error in issuing the order
appealed from.</p>
