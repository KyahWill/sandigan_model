				<H3>SEVERINO GAGOLA, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, EMILIANO ALCALA-ALCALA AND WENCESLAO DE CASTRO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>RUIZ CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><p>Before us for reriew, upon a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, is the decision 
of the Court of Agrarian Relations of January 18, 1962 in CAR case 163 (56) 
Quezon, dismissing the petition of Sererino Gagola for reinstatement and damages 
filed against the respondent Emiliana Alcala-Alcala.</p>
<p>It is uncontroverted that Alcala is the owner of a parcel of land of about a 
hectare in <i>area</i>, situated in barrio Antipolo in Sariaya, Quezon, and 
planted to coconut and burl trees.</p>
<p>The disagreement in the evidence adduced has reference primarily to the 
nature of the relationship between Gagola and Alcala, and to the manner and time 
of the termination of such relationship. Gagola claims that he was a tenant of 
Alcala on the said land from 1945, performing his duties and obligations with 
the degree of faithfulness expected of a good father of a family, until January 
1955 when she unlawfully ejected him. This claim was traversed by Alcala who 
avers that contrary to the pretensions of the petitioner, the latter was a mere 
hired laborer who worked intermittently upon the land, that is, only whenever he 
was needed, and that because he had become negligent and slothful, she dismissed 
him in 1952.</p>
<p>The court <i>a quo</i>, analyzing and evaluating the mass of conflicting 
evidence, concluded that Gagola was indeed a tenant of Alcala on share basis, 
and that he was not ejected by the latter, but that in point of fact he 
voluntarily abandoned the land. The court then rendered judgment dismissing 
Gagola's petition.</p>
<p>The only issue tendered for resolution in this appeal is one of law. Alcala 
having admitted in her reply to the petition that she dismissed Gagola, the 
latter now contends that the respondent court was in error when it ruled that 
Gagola should have established the fact of unlawful ejectment alleged by him in 
his petition, aid that the respondent was in no way called upon to show the 
existence of a lawful cause for his dismissal.</p>
<p>It is our view, however, that the issue of law thus posed need not preoccupy 
us. For although the court <i>a quo</i> did find that Gagola was indeed a tenant 
of Alcala, it went on to conclude that Gagola had "voluntarily left his 
landholding." The correctness of the latter finding Gagola is not now at liberty 
to challenge as he has raised only one issue, which is purely of law.</p>
<p>We have nonetheless reviewed the record, and we agree with the court below 
that its finding of abandonment by Gagola of his landholding is supported by 
substantial evidence.</p>
<p>Tenancy relationship is extinguished by, among other modes, the "abandonment 
of the land by x x x the tenant" (section 9 of Republic Act 1199). Because a 
tenant has possession of the land only through personal cultivation, the 
petitioner's leaving the land in the case at bar amounts to his abandonment of 
the landholding. There being no longer any tenancy relationship between him and 
the respondent Alcala, the relationship having been terminated by his own 
voluntary act, it follows that he has no standing to invoke the protection of 
the principle of security of tenure. </p>
<p><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <i>a quo</i> dismissing the petition below 
is affirmed. No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><i>Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, 
Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar</i> and <i>Sanchez, JJ</i>., concur. </p></div>
