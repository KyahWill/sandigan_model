<p class="BODY">In the said sworn statement, <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, declared in substance as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">About <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the evening of <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1970</st1:date>,

  St.</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:city></st1:address>

and one <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> conversing or "<span class="SpellE">nagkukwentuhan</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the two called for him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benny asked him if he had money and when he answered that he had, the
former invited him and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, they proceeded to the store of "<span class="SpellE">DULING</span>" (Josephine's Store) on <st1:address><st1:street>Taft
  Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:city></st1:address>

<p class="BODY">While drinking beer at the said store, they noticed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> Enriquez, who was also drinking beer at a nearby
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
approached the deceased and engaged the latter in a conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
returned to their table and informed them that the deceased had plenty of money
because the latter often dropped coins in the jukebox, and that he (the
deceased) could be of help in their need for money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being so informed, Benny instructed <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
to go back to the table of the deceased and to ask the latter if he would like to
have a girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> approached and asked the deceased if he would like
to have a girl, to which proposal the deceased consented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three of them accompanied the deceased to
the prostitution house at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Pilapil</span>

  Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:city></st1:address>
City, Benny demanded money from the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter, however, told Benny that he had no more money and instead
offered <span style="">his </span>cigarettes to him,
which Benny refused and insisted that the deceased should give him money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they passed along a dark alley, Benny told
him, "<span class="SpellE">Mando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Itulak</span>
mo".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he pushed the
deceased into the dark alley, and immediately thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
hit the deceased on the head and different parts of his body with a lead pipe,
while Benny whipped out a "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>" and
repeatedly stabbed the deceased on the hand, nape, and slashed his throat and
neck.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the deceased staggered to the ground, Benny took the wallet
of the deceased containing P60.00 and divided it among themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benny also took the wrist watch, ring, and
shirt of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they
fled from the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the prosecution presented in evidence, among
others, the extra-judicial confession of the two accused as well as its only
eyewitness to the crime, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nobello</span>,
who testified thru qualified interpreters.<span style="">&nbsp;

in front of a nearby alley, standing and smoking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she noticed that the said accused was
looking around as if guarding something, she hid herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, she heard a shout or scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she looked at the direction where the
shout came from, she saw three men ganging up on the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them (<span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Ausen</span>) stabbed and slashed the neck of the
deceased, while the other man (<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Raguro</span>) hit the victim on the head and different parts of
the body with a lead pipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third man

Thereafter, she saw the accused <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> take the wallet and the wrist watch of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw also the man with
sideburns (<span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ausen</span>)
remove the T-shirt of the deceased while the short and stout man (<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Raguro</span>) removed the shoes

<p class="BODY">The two accused denied any participation in the commission of the

In addition, they interposed an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the accused <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
claims that about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
morning of <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1970</st1:date>, he
was at his place of work – at the bodega of an ice factory located at the
boundary of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>

delivering the ice, he returned to his place of work, arriving thereat at <st1:time minute="30" hour="2">2:30 a.m.</st1:time> and rested there until he was
relieved at <st1:time minute="0" hour="5">5:00 a.m.</st1:time> by the next

at P. Burgos, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and stayed there until <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 a.m.</st1:time> of that day.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the accused <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Raguro</span> declared that on <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1970</st1:date>, he was at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Lantag</span>,
Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
helping the barrio captain, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Rabong</span>, in

<p class="BODY">After the trial, on <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="9">September

<p class="BODY">The case is now before Us for mandatory review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants now maintain that the trial court erred in holding
that their extra-judicial confessions were given voluntarily; in giving weight
and credence to the testimony of the prosecution's only eyewitness; in
discrediting their defense of alibi; and in imposing the death penalty despite
the absence of conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not impressed by the appellants' insistence that their
extra-judicial confessions were involuntary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Extrajudicial confessions of the accused in a criminal case are
universally recognized as admissible evidence against him, and this rule is
based on the presumption that no one would declare anything against himself
unless such declarations were true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, it has been held that a confession constitutes an evidence
of a high order since it is supported by the strong presumption that no person
of normal mind would deliberately and knowingly confess to a crime unless
prompted by truth and his conscience.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the presumption of the law is in favor of the spontaneity and <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of the statement given by an accused, and it
is incumbent upon him to destroy that presumption.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, in the case at bar,
failed in the exercise of that task.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They have not adduced any evidence to overcome this presumption except
their retraction of their extrajudicial confessions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, We find that there is
nothing on the face of their respective confessions to cast doubt upon their
integrity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their answers to the
questions are res­ponsive and informative, which reflects spontaneity and
coherence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contains details which
could not have been fabricated by the <span class="SpellE">NBI</span>
investigators and which could have been supplied only by the appellants
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for example, in his
sworn statement the appellant <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> declared that he is 25 years old, married, a
driver of an ice delivery truck, and a resident of 34 Electrical Road, Domestic
Airport, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City; that he reached only first year
high school; that <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Raguro</span>
has a tattoo of a woman on his shoulder which was subsequently confirmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the appellant <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Raguro</span> stated in his sworn statement that he is 25 years
old, single, and residing at 240-E H. Domingo, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>;
that he reached only grade six; that he knows how to read and write <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
their confessions substantially interlock, confirming each other as to the
details, and are corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nobello</span>, the prosecution's eyewitness to the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances negate the appellants'
claim of involuntariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
fact that they did not immediately denounce the alleged threats and
maltreatment, or file any complaint against the <span class="SpellE">NBI</span>
agents who allegedly threatened and maltreated them further belie their claim
of involuntariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the main, We are
fully convinced that the appellants herein freely and voluntarily executed
their respective confessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants assail the trial court in giving weight and
credence to the testimony of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nobello</span>, claiming that her testimony is incredible
and improbable, and that, it is inconsistent with her sworn statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they argue that her testimony that she
went to <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span> to hear mass at 3:00 o'clock in the
morning of March 1, 1970, and that when she reached the place where the crime
was committed, she heard a shout or scream, is untrue as it is incredible and
improbable because Holy Masses or any other kind of <span style="">religious </span>services are not celebrated at 3:00 o'clock in the
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, that being deaf and
dumb she could not have heard the alleged shout or scream which drew her
attention to the incident in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming for the sake of argument, that some portions
of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nobello</span>
are incredible and improbable, nevertheless, the same are insufficient to
discredit the whole of her testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court is not bound to believe all that the said witness has
said, but it may give weight and credence to such portions of her testimony as
it may deem worthy of belief and disbelieve the other portions of her
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as one authority puts
it:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Triers</span> of facts are not bound to believe
all that a witness has said; they may accept some portions of his testimony and
reject other portions, according to what seems to them, upon other facts and
circumstances, to be the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even when witnesses are found to have
deliberately falsified in some particulars, the jury are not required to reject
the whole of their uncorroborated testimony, but may credit such portions as
they may deem worthy of belief."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As was stated by this Court:</p>

<blockquote>"It is perfectly reasonable to believe the testimony of a
witness with respect to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it has been aptly said even
when witnesses are found to have deliberately falsified in some material
particulars, it is not required that the whole of their uncorroborated
testimony be rejected, but such portions thereof deemed worthy of belief may be
credited."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, it would suffice to state that the trial court by
reason of its proximate contact with witnesses, is in a more competent position
to discriminate between the true and the false, and in the case at bar, We find
no reason to disturb its conclusion that the said witness of the prosecution
saw the incident in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of the said
witness and her sworn statement,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
it suffices to state that the same refer to minor and collateral matters which
do not affect her credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, it heightens her credibility as it shows that her testimony was
neither coached nor rehearsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from
being evidence of falsehood it could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration
of her good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, it may also be pointed out that <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Nobello</span> did not know personally any of the accused before
the crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did she
know the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had no motive to
fabricate evidence against the appellants implicating them in so grave a crime
as robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The absence of
any improper motive on her part to make a false imputation against the herein
appellants further strengthens her credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants further contend that the said witness lacks the
requisite qualifications of a witness, being a deaf-mute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is equally without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that she is a deaf-mute is
insufficient to justify a finding that she is an incompetent witness,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
so long as she can perceive, and perceiving she can make known her perception
to others.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the trial court ascertained whether the said witness has
the requisite intelligence and ability to convey and make known her perception
to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After such a determination,
the trial court found her to be a competent witness, and allowed her to testify
thru qualified interpreters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact she
was able to make a detailed narration of the events, unfolding them one after
the other as she saw them happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find, therefore, no reason to disagree with the trial court's con­clusion as to
her competence as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, even if the testimony of the said witness is left
wholly out of consideration, still there is sufficient basis for conviction,
for a confession corroborated by evidence of <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>
will suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not indispensable
that an eye?witness should have seen the commission of the crime before
an accused may be held liable under his own confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the usefulness of the confession
as a species of proof would vanish if it were necessary, in addition to the
confession to adduce evidence sufficient to <span style="">j</span>ustify conviction independently of such confession.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the appellants’ contention that the trial court committed
an error in rejecting their defense of alibi is likewise devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is well-settled, to the point of
being trite, that the defense of alibi, which is easy to concoct, must be
received with utmost caution, for it is one of the weakest defenses that can be
resorted to by an accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, to be successful, it must be proven by positive, clear and satisfying
evidence, reasonably satisfying to the mind of the court of the truth of such
defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Where nothing supports it except the testimony of relatives and friends - as in
the present case - the said defense weighs and is worth nothing.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the rule is to the effect that for alibi to prosper, it is not enough <span style="">to </span><span style="">prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was commit</span>ted
but the defendant must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible
for him to have been at the scene of the crime at such time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castañeda's</span> alibi does not meet this requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, their defense of alibi pales
into in­significance considering that they had already admitted in their
respective confessions their participation in the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, such defense cannot prevail over
their confessions which they <span style="">freely and
voluntarily executed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the appellants
dispute the trial court's imposition </span>of the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their contention is that, assuming that there
was conspiracy to commit robbery, the killing of the victim was not a part of
the conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they should be
held liable only for robbery, while their co-accused who actually killed the
victim is the one responsible for the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once conspiracy to commit robbery is admitted
or conceded, the appellants herein are liable for the crime of robbery with
homicide, whether or not they actually participated in the killing of the
victim, for the <span style="">rule is settled that
when homicide takes place as a consequence or on the occasion of the robbery,
all those who took part in the robbery shall be guilty as principals of the
complex crime of robbery with homicide whether or not they actually participated
in the killing, unless there is proof that they had endeavored to prevent the
killing.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The appellants, therefore, are liable as
principals in the crime of robbery with homicide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellants invoke the
mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender for the reason that they never
resisted the authorities when they were arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that they did not resist the
authorities when they were arrested does not amount to voluntary
surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A surrender to be voluntary
must be spontaneous, showing the intent of the accused to submit himself
unconditionally to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the case at bar, there is no voluntary surrender to speak of because the
appellants were in point of fact arrested.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the other hand,
treachery attended the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
attack against the deceased who was unarmed, was sudden and unexpected, without
any warning and without giving him an op</span>portunity to defend

abuse of superior strength is likewise present, however, the same is absorbed
in treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be estimated as
an independent<span style=""> aggravating circumstance
when treachery is present.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
