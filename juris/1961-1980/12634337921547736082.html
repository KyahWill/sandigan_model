				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is supposedly a case about collation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As factual background, it should be stated
that the spouses, Beatriz Bautista and Jose M. Valero, did not beget any child
during their marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1951 Beatriz
adopted Carmen (<span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span>) Bautista. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Jose wanted also to adopt her but because, by
his first marriage, he had two children named Flora Valero <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> Rodriguez and Rosie Valero Gutierrez, he was
disqualified to adopt Carmen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose
manifested in the adoption proceeding that he consented to the use by Carmen of
his surname Valero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See
Civil Case No. 12475, Manila CFI; Art. 338[1], Civil Code and art. 28, Child
and Youth Welfare Code.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 18, 1964, Jose M. Valero donated to Carmen B. Valero
(who was already married to Doctor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>) his
one-half <span class="SpellE"><u>proindiviso</u></span> share (apparently his
inchoate share) in two conjugal lots, with the improvements thereon, located at
San Lorenzo Village, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
with an area of 1,500 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
wife, Beatriz, consented to the donation. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>However, the deed of <span class="GramE">donation</span>
was not registered.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1966</st1:date>,
Jose M. Valero, who was then seventy-three years old, executed his last will
and testament wherein he enumerated the conjugal properties of himself and his
wife, including the two <st1:place><st1:placename>San Lorenzo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>
lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that will, he did not mention
the donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He devised to his wife
properties sufficient to constitute her <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> and
bequeathed the remainder to his two children, Mrs. Rodriguez and Mrs.
Gutierrez.</p>

<p class="BODY">About a month later, or on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1966</st1:date>, the Valero spouses, by means of a deed
of absolute sale, conveyed the <st1:place><st1:placename>San Lorenzo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place> lots and the improvements
thereon to Carmen B. Valero-<span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> for the sum of one
hundred twenty thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale
was registered on the following day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 163270 and 163271 were issued to the
vendee, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1967</st1:date>
she mortgaged the two lots to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
Development Bank as security for a loan of fifty thousand pesos (page 204, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Beatriz B. Valero died intestate on <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1972</st1:date>, survived by her husband and her
adopted child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her estate is pending
settlement in Special Proceeding No. 88896 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>
was named <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of her adopted mother's
estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than a month later, or on <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1972</st1:date>, Jose M. Valero died testate, survived
by his two children, Mrs. Rodriguez and Mrs. Gutierrez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His will was duly probated in Special
Proceeding No. 88677, also of the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lawyer <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Unson</span>, the executor, submitted an inventory wherein,
following the list of conjugal assets in the testator's will, the two San
Lorenzo Village lots were included as part of the testate estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">That inclusion provoked Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>,
the adopted child of Mrs. Valero, and Mrs. Rodriguez and Mrs. Gutierrez, the
legitimate children of the testator, Jose M. Valero, to file (through Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span> lawyer) in the testate proceeding a motion for the
exclusion of the two San Lorenzo Village lots from the testator's inventoried
estate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Adduced as reason for the exclusion is the fact
that since </span><st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="2"><span class="GramE">February
 16, 1966</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>
has been the registered owner of the lots as shown by two </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Torrens</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> titles, copies of
which were attached to the motion.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The executor opposed the motion on the ground that the two lots
were donated to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> and the donation would
allegedly involve collation and the <span class="SpellE">donee's</span> title to
the lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The executor revealed that he
was informed by Mrs. Gutierrez and Mrs. Rodriguez (supposed <span class="SpellE">movants</span>)
that the two lots should be included in the inventory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the issue of collation was prematurely
raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">The probate court in its order of <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1973</st1:date> excluded the two lots from the inventory of
the testator's estate but with the understanding "that the same are subject
to collation".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1973</st1:date>
or one hundred twelve days after Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> was
served with a copy of that order, she filed a motion for its
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She insisted that she
is the owner of the two <st1:place><st1:placename>San Lorenzo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>
lots as indicated in the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one opposed that motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of that motion, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span> lawyer <span class="GramE">apprised</span> the court
that the executor informed him over the phone that he was not opposing the
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The probate court in its order of <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1973</st1:date> ruled that the two lots were
unconditionally excluded from the inventory of Jose M. Valero's estate, meaning
"that they are not subject to collation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order is the bone of contention in this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Rodriguez (without being joined by her sister, Mrs.
Gutierrez) filed a motion for the reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that the two <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Lorenzo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>
lots were really conveyed to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> by way of
donation because the consideration for the sale was allegedly only one-fifth of
the true value of the lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
Rodriguez further contended that the order of <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1973</st1:date> was final in character.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reply, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> countered that
the prior order was interlocutory and that in 1966 the true value of the two
lots was around P120<span class="GramE">,000</span> and that their value
increased considerably in 1973 or 1974.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the relatively low price of the sale could be attributed to
the fact that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> and her husband lived with
the <span class="SpellE">Valeros</span> and were taking care of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The probate court denied the motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Rodriguez and Mrs. Gutierrez, in their
petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court of Appeals, assailed the probate
court's order declaring that the two lots were not subject to collation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals held that the order of exclusion dated <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1973</st1:date> was interlocutory and
that it could be changed or modified at anytime during the course of the
administration proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It further held that it was immaterial whether the two lots were
donated or sold to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> as "a mere
subterfuge to avoid payment of the donor's and <span class="SpellE">donee's</span>
taxes".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the Appellate
Court, it was immaterial because under article 1061 of the Civil Code, only
compulsory heirs are required to make collation for the determination of their <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> and, under section 2, Rule 90 of the Rules of
Court, only heirs are involved in questions as to advancement and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span> is not an heir of the testator, Jose M. Valero (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Rodriguez vs. Valero <span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>,
CA-G.R. No. <span class="GramE">SP-02944, </span><st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 28, 1974</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
per G.S. Santos, <span class="SpellE">Gaviola</span>, Jr. and De Castro, <u>JJ</u>.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">From that decision, an appeal was made to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was not given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, upon motion for reconsideration and
over Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span> opposition, the appeal was later
allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' only assignment of error is that the Court of
Appeals should have held that the probate court's order of exclusion dated <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1973</st1:date> was not interlocutory
but was a final and <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> order and that the
order of <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1973</st1:date>
modifying the order of August 3 is void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the order of exclusion dated <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1973</st1:date> was not a final order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was interlocutory in the sense that it did
not settle once and for all the title to the <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Lorenzo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>
lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate court in the exclusion
incident could not determine the question of title.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing rule is that for the purpose of determining
whether a certain property should or should not be included in the inventory,
the probate court may pass upon the title thereto but such determination is not
conclusive and is subject to the final decision in a separate action regarding
ownership which may be instituted by the parties (3 Moran's Comments on the
Rules of Court, 1970 Edition, pages 448-9 and 473; <span class="SpellE">Lachenal</span>
vs. Salas, L-42257, June 14, 1976, 71 SCRA 262, 266).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold further that the dictum of the Court of Appeals and the
probate court that the two disputed lots are not subject to collation was a
supererogation and was not necessary to the disposition of the case which
merely involved the issue of inclusion in, or exclusion from, the inventory of
the testator's estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue of
collation was not yet <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> at that early stage
of the testate proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
necessary to mention in the order of exclusion the controversial matter of
collation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether collation may exist with respect to the two lots and
whether Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span> <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles thereto are indefeasible are matters that may be raised later or may not
be raised at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How those issues
should be resolved, if and when they are raised, need not be touched upon in
the adjudication of this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intestate and testate proceedings for the settlement of the estates
of the deceased Valero spouses were consolidated, as ordered by the lower court
on November 21, 1974, so that the conjugal estate of the deceased spouses may
be properly liquidated, as contemplated in section 2, Rule 73 of the Rules of
Court and Act No. 3176 (Pages 223 and 235-6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the <span class="SpellE"><u>expedientes</u></span>
of the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We found that the
proceedings have not yet reached the stage when the question of collation or
advancement to an heir may be raised and decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The numerous debts of the decedents are still
being paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The net remainder (<span class="SpellE"><u>remanente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>liquido</u></span>)
of their conjugal estate has not yet been determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, up to this time, no
separate action has been brought by the appellants to nullify Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span> <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titles to the
disputed lots or to show that the sale was in reality a donation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, it is not proper to pass upon the question of
collation and to decide whether Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Rustia's</span> titles
to the disputed lots are questionable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The proceedings below have not reached the stage of partition and distribution
when the <span class="SpellE">legitimes</span> of the compulsory heirs have to be
determined.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals
and the orders of the lower court dated August 9 and December 14, 1973,
excluding from the <u>inventory</u> of Jose M. Valero's estate the two San
Lorenzo Village lots now registered in the name of Carmen B. Valero-<span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>, but we delete from that decision and the two orders
any ruling regarding collation which is a matter that may be passed upon by the
probate court at the time when it is seasonably raised by the interested
parties, if it is ever raised at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote for the unqualified <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of respondent appellate court's decision sustaining the exclusion from the
inventory of Jose M. Valero's estate of the two <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Lorenzo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>
lots registered in the name of respondent Carmen B. Valero-<span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>
by virtue of the deed of absolute sale thereof executed by him in his lifetime
on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1966</st1:date> in her
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of collation of said lots is immaterial insofar as
respondent and the deceased Jose M. Valero's estate and petitioners are
concerned, since respondent is not even an heir of his estate (which he had
willed to his two legitimate children, herein petitioners, his second wife
Beatriz Bautista having predeceased him in September, 1972).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 1061 of the Civil Code, only a
compulsory heir succeeding <u>with</u> other compulsory heirs is required to
collate whatever property he/she may have received from the decedent during the
decedent's lifetime "by way of <u>donation</u>, or any other <u>gratuitous</u>
title, in order that it may be computed in the determination of the <span class="SpellE"><u>legitime</u></span> of each heir, and in the account of the
partition." There can therefore be no collation here because from the
documents of record, respondent Carmen B. Valero-<span class="SpellE">Rustia</span>
is not a compulsory heir who received property by donation or gratuitous title
from the deceased that would be subject to collation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The properties in question had been transferred by deed of
absolute sale to <span class="GramE">said</span> respondent-vendee more than six
years before the vendor Jose M. Valero died in October, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased having long divested himself of
title to the said properties, they were properly excluded from the inventory of
his estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The real question between petitioners (children of the deceased
vendor) and respondent-vendee (a stranger to the deceased's estate) is not
collation, but a question of title and ownership of the properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate court has no jurisdiction over
this question and petitioners must bring a separate action if they wish to
question respondent's title and ownership.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even granting their claim that the deed of sale should be considered a
donation or gratuitous transfer, (because of the allegedly excessively low
price), their only recourse would be not collation, but a separate action for
reduction of the donation to the extent that they may show it to be <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span> (exceeding that which the deceased may give by
will) under the provisions of Articles 750 and 752 of the Civil Code.</p>
