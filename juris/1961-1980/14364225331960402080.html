				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In Civil Case No. Q-8487 of the Court of First Instant of Rizal, Branch IV, Quezon City, entitled "Juan Cabullo, et al., plaintiffs, vs. PHHC and J.V. Development Corporation, defendants," the trial court rendered on October 24, 1966 a decision in favor of the plaintiffs therein against the defendants declaring that the plaintiffs have preferential rights to purchase the portion of Lot No. 11 occupied by them and declaring as null and void the sales contract over said Lot No. 11 in favor of General Products Corporation, Antonio V. del Rosario and J.V. Development Corporation together with T.C.T. Nos. 52002, 63716 and 63717 (pp. 95-106, rec. on appeal, Annex "F"). From said decision, the defendants filed their notice of appeal on March 6, 1967 (p. 130-131, Annex "F", rec. on appeal). <p>In a resolution dated December 19, 1967, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal "for having been perfected out of time and for non-compliance with the provision of Section 6, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court in connection with Rule 50, Section 1 (a) and Rule 56, Section 1" (Annex "A", pp. 20-22, rec.). After their motion for reconsideration of the resolution of the Court of Appeals was denied in a resolution dated February 13, 1968 (Annex "B", p. 23, rec.), defendant-appellant J.V. Development Corporation filed on March 20, 1968 this petition for review by certiorari (pp. 29-37, rec.), followed by a motion for leave to file an amended petition for review and to admit the amended petition for review attached to said motion (pp. 52-69, rec.).</p> <p>In a resolution dated April 15, 1968, We granted the motion for leave to file an amended petition for review and noted the contents of the amended petition for review and attached to said motion (p. 173, rec.).</p> <p>In a resolution dated August 22, 1968, the petition for review was given due course (p. 214, rec.). On October 11, 1968, herein petitioner filed its brief (p. 221, rec.) and on January 20, 1969, herein respondents filed their brief (p. 238, rec.).</p> <p>On April 15, 1969, the case was deemed submitted for decision (p. 240, rec.).</p> <p>On September 11, 1971, the parties represented by their respective counsels filed a joint motion to dismiss on the ground that they have already settled their differences, attaching thereto a compromise agreement (Annex "A", pp. 259-262) and praying "that the judgment rendered in the above-entitled case be set aside and that the case be accordingly dismissed."</p> <p>The amicable settlement, Annex "A", stipulates that:</p> <blockquote> <p>"WHEREAS, J.V.
