				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These cases are interrelated. The petitioners in L-18251 and L-18252 are 
Irineo Santos, Jr., Antonio Pineda, Benito Puzon, Virgilio Elayda, Graciano 
Abad, Bernardino Torrijos, Virgilio Miclat and Mario Reyes, whereas Florentino 
B. Molinyawe is the sole petitioner in G. R. Nos. L-18256 and L-18260. The 
respondents in these four (4) cases, are identical, namely, Hon. Jose P. Flores, 
as Judge of the Court of First Instance of La Union, and Alejandro Sebastian, 
Rufino Marasigan and Pedro Ofiana.
<p>It appears that on November 27, 1959, the Secretary of Justice issued 
Administrative Order No. 185, directing respondent Alejandro Sebastian, aside 
from Isidro Vejunco and Meneleo Mesina, "to assist the provincial fiscal of La 
Union and other provincial and city fiscals and attorneys in the investigation 
and prosecution of the alleged ACCFA's fraudulent tobacco deals". Thereupon, 
respondents Rufino Marasigan and Pedro Ofiana, as provincial fiscal and 
assistant provincial fiscal, respectively, of La Union, together with respondent 
Sebastian, who are hereinafter referred to collectively as the prosecutors, 
seized ACCFA (Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration) and 
CCE (Central Cooperative Exchange) records of tobacco purchases and redrying, 
sealed the ACCFA warehouses in the redrying plant in Agoo, La Union, where the 
tobacco purchased in 1959 were stored, and conducted <i>ex parte</i> the 
investigation referred to in said Administrative Order, by taking down the 
testimony of witnesses, and examining, with the assistance of tobacco experts, 
the confiscated tobacco, a considerable amount of which turned out to be native 
tobacco, although purchased and passed of, as well as paid for, as Virginia 
tobacco, aside from a sizeable quantity of low grade Virginia tobacco purchased 
as high grade tobacco and paid for at the price fixed by law for said high grade 
tobacco. After ascertaining the names of the persons involved in said tobacco 
deals, hereinafter referred to as defendants, the prosecutors prepared the 
corresponding informations against them. Inasmuch, however, as some of the 
aforementioned defendants had subsequently asked the Department of Justice for 
an opportunity to give their side of the matter before the filing of said 
informations, the prosecutors decided that all of the defendants be given such 
opportunity. Hence, the prosecutors sent to said defendants, including 
petitioners herein, a notice, dated March 23, 1960, informing them that the 
former would conduct a preliminary investigation "on March 20—April 2, 1960, at 
8:30 a.m., in the office of the Provincial Fiscal, San Fernando, La Union." The 
notice received by Molinyawe. reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are hereby notified that the undersigned will conduct the preliminary 
investigation of the above-entitled case on <i>Mar. 20-Apr. 2, 1960</i> at 8:30 
a.m., in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal, San Fernando, La Union. At the 
hearing, you may appear in person or with the assistance of counsel. Failure to 
appear and adduce evidence in your favor will be considered a waiver on your 
part to be heard, and such steps as the facts and the law on the case warrant 
will then be taken.</p>
<p>"For your information, you are advised that, in a previous inquiry, it has 
been established that during the period from September 1, 1959 and November 10, 
1959, in the Redrying Plant of the Central Cooperative Exchange (CCE) in the 
Municipality of Agoo, Province of La Union, in violation of existing laws which 
authorize it to buy only Virginia type leaf Tobacco grown and produced in the 
Philippines, the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration, 
commonly known as ACCFA, in a series of transactions purchased from different 
Farmers Cooperative Marketing-Associations (Facomas), two million kilos of 
native leaf tobacco which have been falsely entered and made to appear in papers 
and books kept by ACCFA as Virginia leaf tobacco and which were paid for as 
such, to the damage of the Government which supplied the money used in such 
purchases in the amount of Three Million Pive Hundred Thousand Pesos 
(P3,500,000). Needless to say, the crime of Malversation of Public Funds Through 
Falsification of Public and Official Documents was committed. You were, during 
the period alluded to, employed as ACCFA Chief of Operations, with the function 
of exercising full control ir purchasing tobacco in Agoo, La Union and the 
evidence gathered reveals that directly or indirectly, and in connivance with 
your co-respondents, you participated in the commission of the crime. The 
evidence constitutes a prima facie case against you, and unless overcome, 
justifies your inclusion in the information to be filed in 
Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>The notices received by the other petitioners herein were identical, except 
as regards the description of the positions they respectively held as employees 
of the ACCFA.</p>
<p>When the preliminary investigation began on March 29, 1960, the prosecutors 
announced that their purpose was merely to hear the side of the defense and to 
receive its evidence, because that introduced at the previous inquiry had 
already been found to be sufficient to justify the filing of the corresponding 
informations. Counsel for petitioners in these four (4) cases then asked that 
they be informed of the particulars of the charges against them, and allowed to 
examine the records of the <i>ex parte</i> investigation, and the evidence 
introduced therein, as well as to cross-examine the witnesses who Jiad testified 
on said occasion. Acting upon this request, the prosecutors caused the draft of 
the informations prepared by them—which are substantially identical to those 
eventually filed in court—to be read to petitioners herein. The latter were not 
allowed to examine the records of the <i>ex parte</i> investigation, 
particularly the affidavits made by said witnesses, but the documentary 
evidence, consisting of records of the ACCFA and the CCE, were placed at their 
disposal for two (2) days. Moreover, the prosecutors refused to recall said 
witnesses for cross-examination by petitioners, who protested against the 
procedure being followed by said prosecutors and announced that they 
(petitioners) would have nothing to do with the proceedings. The prosecutors 
then gave petitioners herein up to April 5, 1960 to take up the matter with the 
Supreme Court, whereupon petitioners and other defendants walked out of the room 
in which the investigation was being held and did not attend further hearings. 
This notwithstanding the investigation continued, with respect to other 
defendants, from March 29 to April 6, 1960, during which period the testimony of 
around 80 defendants and their witnesses was taken. Upon the request of some 
defendants, who resided in Manila and nearby provinces and had complained about 
the expenses incident to their stay in San Fernando, La Union, the investigation 
was resumed in Manila on April 12 and subsequent dates.</p>
<p>Thereafter, or on May 16, 1960, two (2) informations, one for malversation of 
public funds with falsification of public and official documents, and another 
for malversation of public funds, were filed with the Court of First Instance of 
La Union and docketed therein as Criminal Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997, thereof, 
against 61 and 48 persons, respectively, including, in both cases, petitioners 
herein. On or about June 15, 1960, said informations were amended by dropping 
thirty-one (31) and six (6) defendants, respectively, not including petitioners 
herein, from the charges in said Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on motion of respondents Sebastian and Marasigan, dated May 17, 
1960, writs of preliminary attachment of the properties of the defendants in 
said criminal cases were issued on May 27, 1960. Said defendants sought, on June 
17, 1960, the dissolution of said writs, which was denied by respondent Hon. 
Jose P. Flores, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of La Union, on June 28, 
1960. The arraignment of the defendants having subsequently been set for 
November 21, 1960, petitioners m G. R. Nos. L-18251 and L-18252 moved to quash 
the amended informations.</p>
<p>Prior thereto, or on November 5, 1960, the Government had instituted Civil 
Case No. 6379 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, against several 
defendants, including herein petitioner, Florentino B. Molinyawe, for forfeiture 
of property allegedly acquired by him, during his incumbency, in an amount 
manifestly out of proportion to his lawful income, as a public official, in 
violation of Republic Act No. 1379, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft Law. 
Thereupon, or on November 16, 1960, Molinyawe moved to quash the informations in 
the aforesaid Criminal Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997, relying not only upon the 
grounds invoked by petitioners in said cases G. R. Nos. L-18251 and L-18252, 
but, also, upon said Republic Act No. 1379. The motions to quash these two (2) 
sets of defendants were denied by respondent Judge on March 13, 1961. Soon, 
thereafter, or on March 17, 1961, petitioners were notified that their 
arraignment would take place on April 4, 1961. Thereupon, or on March 27, 1961, 
Irineo Santos, Jr., Antonio Pineda, Benito Puzon, Virgilio Elayda, Graciano Abad 
Bernardino Torrijos, Virgilio Miclat and Marino Reyes, instituted Cases G. R. 
Nos. L-18251 and L-18252 of this Court. The next day, Molinyawe commenced Cases 
G. R. Nos. L-18256 and L-18260.</p>
<p>These four (4) cases are for certiorari, prohibition and/or mandamus, with 
preliminary injunction to restrain the respondents, their associates, 
representatives, delegates, subordinates, substitutes and all other persons 
acting by or under their direction or in cooperation with them, from further 
proceeding in said Criminal Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997 and from enforcing the 
orders and writs of attachment issued therein, as well as from doing any act 
tending directly or indirectly to render ineffectual whatever judgment may be 
rendered by this Court. Petitioners pray, also, that, after due hearing, 
judgment be rendered, annulling the preliminary investigation conducted by the 
prosecutors and the proceedings relative to the filing of the informations and 
amended informations and to the issuance of the writs of preliminary attachment 
above referred to, declaring that respondent Judge has no jurisdiction to hear 
said criminal cases and commanding him to forthwith dismiss the same. 
Furthermore, petitioner Molinyawe prays that he be declared, pursuant to section 
8 of Republic Act No. 1379, immune from further prosecution in the 
aforementioned criminal cases, by reason of the pendency of Civil Case No. 6379 
of the Court of First Instance of Rizal against him, and that respondents herein 
be commanded to "forever desist from prosecuting" him "for any transaction, 
matter or thing he is compelled to explain in said Civil Case No. 6379".</p>
<p>The main issues, common to these four (4) cases, are: (1) whether petitioners 
herein, as defendants in said Criminal Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997, are entitled, 
as a matter of right, to examine the affidavits of the witnesses who appeared 
before the prosecutors in the course of the investigation conducted by them 
prior to March 29, 1960, and to cross-examine said witnesses; and (2) whether 
the writs of preliminary detachment issued on May 27, 1960 should be dissolved 
or annulled, owing to the alleged insufficiency of the affidavit submitted by 
the prosecution in said cases in support of its motion for the issuance of said 
writs.</p>
<p>The first issue hinges on the proper interpretation and construction of 
section 1687 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, the pertinent part 
of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A provincial fiscal, an assistant provincial fiscal and a special counsel 
appointed under section 1686 of this Code shall have authority to conduct 
investigation into the matter of any crime or misdemeanor and have the necessary 
information or complaint prepared or made against persons charged with the 
commission of the same. If the offense charged falls within the original 
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, the defendant shall <i>not be 
entitled as a matter of right to preliminary investigation</i> in any case where 
the provincial fiscal himself, or an assistant provincial fiscal, or a special 
counsel, after due investigation of the facts made in the presence of the 
accused <i>if the latter so requested</i>, shall have presented an information 
against him in proper form and certified under oath by the said provincial 
fiscal or assistant provincial fiscal or special counsel that he conducted a 
proper preliminary investigation. To this end, he may, with due notice to the 
accused, summon reputed witnesses and require them to appear before liim and 
testify and be cross-examined under oath by the accused <i>upon the latter's 
request</i>. The attendance or evidence of absent or recalcitrant witnesses who 
may be summoned or whose testimony may be required by the provincial fiseal, or 
assistant provincial fiscal, or special counsel under the authority herein 
conferred shall be enforced by proper process upon application to be made by the 
provincial fiscal, or assistant provincial fiscal, or special counsel to any 
Judge of First Instance of the Judicial District. But no witness summoned to 
testify under this section shall be compelled to give testimony to incriminate 
himself."</p></blockquote>
<p>At the outset, it will be recalled that, prior to the preliminary 
investigation held on March 29, 1960 and subsequent dates, the prosecutors had 
made an investigation of the facts pertinent to the malversation of public funds 
and falsification of public and official documents which, later on, became the 
subject matter of Criminal Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997. Had the prosecutors filed 
the informations therein relying exclusively upon the evidence obtained in said 
previous investigation, there would have been no possible doubt that petitioners 
herein would not be entitled to examine the sworn statements aforementioned and 
to cross-examine the makers thereof, for the provision above quoted explicity 
declares that "the defendant shall <i>not</i> be entitled as a matter of 
<i>right</i> to preliminary investigation". His right, under said provision, to 
be present at the investigation conducted by the prosecutor and to cross-examine 
the witnesses who may appear before the latter, is conditioned upon the 
existence of a "request", which must, perforce, <i>precede</i> said 
investigation by the prosecutor. There had been no such request by herein 
petitioners before March 29, 1960. The request made by them on that date did not 
impose upon the prosecutors the mandatory duty to disclose the details of the 
evidence introduced, and to recall the witnesses who had testified, <i>prior</i> 
thereto. This was a matter entirely within the sound discretion of the 
prosecutors, who, we find, had acted within the proper bounds thereof.</p>
<p>It should be noted, also, that the prosecutors considered the evidence and 
facts gathered by them prior to March 29, 1960, as sufficient to warrant the 
filing of the corresponding informations, which were, accordingly, prepared by 
them, and that the institution of the corresponding criminal actions was 
deferred at the behest merely of some of the prospective defendants, who had 
asked that <i>their respective sides be heard</i> before the filing of said 
informations. For this reason, the notice sent to herein petitioners and other 
defendants advised them that the evidence introduced in the previous inquiry 
"constitutes a <i>prima facie</i> case against you and unless overcome justifies 
your inclusion in the information to be filed in court". This notice did not 
have the effect of revoking or annulling the investigation previously conducted 
by the prosecutors. It gave petitioners herein no other right than that to give 
<i>their side</i> of the case, if they wanted to. It did not entitle them to 
examine the sworn statements taken at said previous inquiry or to cross-examine 
the respective affiants. By giving to petitioners the gist of the evidence 
secured at said previous investigation and placing at their disposal the 
documentary evidence then taken, consisting of records of the ACCFA and the CCE, 
the prosecutors had complied with the letter and spirit of section 1687 of the 
Revised Administrative Code, as amended, and satisfied the demands of justice 
and due process.</p>
<p>In the language of Senator Sumulong, the sponsor of Senate Bill No. 315, 
which upon approval, became Republic Act No. 732, amending said section 1687, of 
the Revised Administrative Code, the purpose of the amendment was merely "to 
authorize provincial fiscals to conduct preliminary investigations in the same 
way that is being done * * * in the City of Manila". Hence, referring to a 
provision in the Charter of Roxas City analogous to that of the City of Manila, 
we held in People vs. Ramilo, 98 Phil., 545:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 11 of Rule 108 of the Rules of Court clearly provides that, the 
right of a defendant after his arrest is (1) to be informed of the complaint or 
information filled against him and of the substance of the testimony and 
evidence presented against him; and (2) to be allowed, if he so desires, to 
testify or to present witnesses or evidence in his favor. As of right, 
therefore, in a preliminary investigation, an accused is not entitled to 
cross-examine the witnesses presented against him. Hence, the demand of the 
herein accused during the reinvestigation conducted by the City Attorney that 
the witnesses for the prosecution be recalled so that she could cross-examine 
them was not based on any provision of law and therefore the City Attorney of 
Roxas City has correctly denied such demand."</p></blockquote>
<p>Such view was reiterated in Abrera vs. Muñoz, 108 Phil., 1124, and we find no 
plausible reason to depart therefrom.</p>
<p>Indeed, the purpose of a preliminary investigation is, not to have a full 
dress investigation that would delay unnecessarily the disposition of judicial 
proceedings, but, no more than "to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious 
and oppressive prosecutions, and to protect him from an open and public 
accusation of crime, from the trouble, expenses and anxiety of a public trial, 
and, also, to protect the State from useless and expensive trials". (U.S. vs. 
Grant, 18 Phil., 122; U.S. vs. Marfori, 35 Phil., 666; Marcos vs. Cruz, 67 
Phil., 82; People vs. Magpole, 70 Phil., 176.) For these reasons, pursuant to 
section 11 of Rule 108 of the Rules of Court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the arrest of the defendant and his delivery to the court, he shall be 
informed of the complaint or information filed against him. He shall also be 
informed of the <i>substance</i> of the testimony and evidence presented against 
him, and, if he desires to testify or to present witnesses or evidence in his 
favor, he may be allowed to do so. The testimony of the witnesses need not be 
reduced to writing but that of the defendant shall be taken in writing and 
subscribed by him".</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what has been done in connection with Criminal Cases Nos. 
2996 and 2997. Petitioners herein were informed of the gist of the testimony 
taken at the previous investigation and allowed to examine the documents, 
consisting of official records, seized prior thereto, as well as to present 
evidence in their defense. Under these facts, it is clear to us that the 
objective of the law on preliminary investigations had been attained.</p>
<p>Petitioners assail the propriety and validity of the investigations conducted 
in Manila on April 12, 1960 and subsequent dates as violative of the provisions 
concerning venue. Regardless, however, of the merits of the objection in 
abstract, it appears that said investigations were held in Manila <i>upon the 
request of defendants</i> other than petitioners herein and referred exclusively 
to the participation of said defendants, <i>not</i> to that of petitioners 
herein, in the commission of the aforementioned offenses. Petitioners, 
accordingly, have no cause for complaint thereon.</p>
<p>They insist, however, that the writs of preliminary attachment above 
mentioned were illegally issued and that the same should be, either dissolved, 
or annulled, upon the following grounds, namely: (<i>a</i>) the motion for the 
issuance of said writs was filed by respondent Alejandro Sebastian, who, 
petitioners aver, has no personality to file said motion, the offended party 
being the ACCFA; (<i>b</i>) the motion was sworn to by said respondent, who it 
is urged, has no personal knowledge of the truth of the allegations of fact made 
in said motion.</p>
<p>We find no merit in this pretense. As one of the official prosecutors in 
Criminal Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997, respondent Sebastian has the authority to 
apply for such remedies as may be necessary to protect the interest of the 
offended party in said cases, particularly considering that the corresponding 
civil liability of the culprits is to be determined therein, no reservation 
having been made of the right to enforce it in a separate civil action. Again, 
respondent Sebastian alleged specifically in the aforesaid motion that he 
"personally" know the facts of these cases. Although he explained this knowledge 
by adding that he had "conducted personally the preliminary investigation of the 
same", it does not follow that his aforesaid knowledge is hearsay in nature. In 
this connection, we must not overlook the fact that the main issues in Criminal 
Cases Nos. 2996 and 2997 were: (<i>a</i>) whether native tobacco had been 
purchased, passed of and paid for as Virginia tobacco; (<i>b</i>) whether low 
grade tobacco were purchased as high grade tobacco and paid for at the price 
fixed by law for such high grade tobacco, and (<i>c</i>) whether the public and 
official records of said purchases had been falsified, and, in the affirmative, 
by whom.' The nature of these issues is such that the determination thereof 
depends principally upon the contents of said records and the stock found in the 
warehouse in which the tobacco purchased had been stored, of which respondent 
Sebastian could have, and seemingly had, personal knowledge.</p>
<p>As indicated above, petitioner Molinyawe maintains that Criminal Cases Nos. 
2996 and 2997 should be dismissed, insofar as he is concerned, and respondents 
should be restrained from further prosecution in said cases, in view of the 
pendency of Civil Case No. 6379 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal for 
forfeiture of property allegedly acquired by him in violation of Republic Act 
No. 1379, section 8 of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Neither the respondent nor any other person shall be excused from attending 
and testifying or from producing books, papers, correspondence, memoranda and 
other records on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or 
otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to 
prosecution; but no individual shall be prosecuted criminally for or on account 
of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled, after 
having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce 
evidence, documentary or otherwise, except that such individual so testifying 
shall not be exempt from prosecution and conviction for perjury or false 
testimony committed in so testifying or from administrative 
proceedings".</p></blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to this provision, "no individual shall be prosecuted criminally for 
or on account of a transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is 
compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to 
testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise * * *". The records before 
us do not show that he has already testified or produced evidence in Civil Case 
No. 6379. Much less do said records indicate the nature of said testimony or 
evidence, and, consequently, its hearing, if any, on the criminal cases referred 
to above. Indeed, not even copies of the pertinent pleadings in said Civil Case 
No. 6379 have been attached to said records. Hence, we are not in a position to 
determine the applicability of said section 8 of Republic Act No. 1379 to the 
aforementioned criminal cases.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petitions in these four (4) cases are denied and said cases 
are hereby dismissed, with costs against the petitioners. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, 
Dizon, Regala,</i> and <i>Makalintal, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
