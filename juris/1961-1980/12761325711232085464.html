				G.R. No. L-22193, May 29, 1964</h4>
				<H3>LAGUNA TAYABAS BUS COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. JULIETA CORNISTA, THRU HER PARENTS, GIL CORNISTA AND MANUELA BELSONTA CORNISTA RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Julieta Cornista, through her parents, sued petitioner in the Court of First 
Instance of Leyte (Civil Case No. 2298) for damages arising from breach of 
contract of carriage, her claim being that, while a passenger of one of 
petitioner's buses, she sustained physical injuries through the negligence of 
petitioner and its driver. Petitioner's principal defense was that Julieta's own 
negligence was the proximate cause of her injuries. After trial, the Court 
rendered judgment for the plaintiff awarding her the amount of P6,000 as moral 
damages, plus the amount of P300, for medical attendance, and P1,000 as 
attorney's fees, with costs. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reduced the moral 
damages to P3,000, and affirmed the appealed decision in all other respects. 
</p>
<p>Petitioner now seeks a review of the last mentioned decision for the purpose 
of having it set aside, or to have the award of moral damages eliminated. </p>
<p>The principal facts, as found by the trial Court, are as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court, in considering the evidence presented in support of the main 
issue, is satisfied that the proximate cause of the injuries suffered by 
plaintiff Julieta Cornista, as shown by Exhibit 'A' was the negligence of both 
the defendant and its driver of bus No. 284 who, at the time of the incident at 
bar, unmindful of the warning given him by his passengers, recklessly operated 
and drove said bus at high speed even on sharp curves of the road. A look at 
Exhs. ‘7’ and ‘7-A’ will readily show that bus No. 284, wherein on November 9, 
1957, plaintiff Julieta Cornista was a passenger and from where she fell when 
said bus was running at a high speed on a curve, the right side of said bus is 
not covered nor protected by any bar to safeguard passengers Sitting at the 
extreme ends of the scats on the right side from falling therefrom." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the above facts—which must be deemed final-petitioner's liability for 
damages cannot be doubted. The decision in Lara <em>vs</em>. Valencia, 55 Off. 
Gaz., 4438, does not apply to the present for the reason that, as found by the 
trial Court, Julieta Cornista was not guilty of negligence. While the Court of 
Appeals found her chargeable with contributory negligence because, instead of 
holding the hand of her friend Myrna Cruz, who was seated beside her, she should 
have held tenaciously on to the bus itself, We believe with said Court that 
while such circumstance justifies the reduction of the moral damages awarded by 
the Court of origin, it does not justify the exemption from liability of 
petitioner herein. </p>
<p>Regarding petitioner's contention that no award of moral damages should have 
been made in favor of the injured passenger, it must be borne in mind that the 
Court of origin not only round petitioner's driver guilty of reckless driving, 
but also found petitioner itself guilty of negligence because "the right side of 
said bus is not covered nor protected by any bar to safeguard passengers sitting 
at the extreme ends of the seats on the right side from falling therefrom." </p>
<p>Under the provisions of Art. 2220 of the New Civil Code, in cases of breach 
of contract (including one of transportation or carriage), either fraud or bad 
faith, that is, wanton and deliberately injurious conduct on the part of the 
carrier is necessary to justify an award of moral damages. Petitioner's 
negligence consisting in its failure to cover the right side of the bus in 
question with a bar or some other contrivance to safeguard or protect passengers 
falls within this category of misconduct. </p>
<p>Wherefore, petition under consideration is dismissed for lack of merit.</p>
