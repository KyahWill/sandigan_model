				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance
of Iloilo (CC <span style="">6425) </span>dismissing a
petition for re­lief directed against the judgment rendered by the municipal
court of Iloilo City <span style="">in its </span>civil case <span style="">7220.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="29" month="3">March <span style="">29, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>the Roman Catholic Archbishop of <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
filed a <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> complaint against <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> with the
municipal court of <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
presided by Judge Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Lutero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hearing, originally set for <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="4">April <span style="">30,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>was
postponed to May <span style="">24 </span>for failure
of the defendant to receive summons, and then postponed again to June <span style="">27 </span>for the same reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was thereafter postponed to July 16, then
to July <span class="GramE"><span style="">24,</span></span><span style=""> </span>and finally to August <span style="">27, </span>all at the behest of the
defendant's Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span>, on the grounds that
"he has not finished his business transactions in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>"
and that "he hurt his right foot toe".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last postponement was granted by the
municipal court with the warning that no further postponement would be
entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was called for trial on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="8">August <span style="">27, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>neither the defendant nor his
counsel Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span> appeared although one Atty. <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> who was present in
court <span style="">ver</span>bally
moved for the postponement of the trial on the ground that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span> was in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
attending to a business transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff's counsel objected to the motion on the ground that the defendant and
his counsel were well aware of the court's previous admonition that no further
postponement of the case would be granted, and then manifested that the
witnesses and the evidence for the plaintiff were ready for presentation on
that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verbal motion for post­ponement
was denied and the plaintiff was directed to adduce his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the presentation of the plaintiff's
evi­dence, the municipal court received a telegram from Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span> requesting postponement of the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial proceeded nevertheless, and, on the
basis of the plaintiff's evidence, the court on the same date rendered judgment
for the plaintiff and against the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter's counsel received a copy of the decision on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="9">September <span style="">9,
 </span>1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
following September 11, <span class="GramE">he</span> filed a motion to set aside
judgment and for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion
was denied on September 26; a copy of the order of denial was received by him
on the same date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 16, 1963, or about 50 days later, the defend­ant thru
his same counsel filed a petition for relief (from the judgment of the
municipal court) with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, praying that the
decision in question be set aside, that the <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case be set for trial on the me­rits, and, pending determination of the
petition, that an in­junction issue restraining the enforcement of the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the petitioner
averred that his absence on the date of the trial was excusable as he attended
to a very ur­gent business transaction in Manila; that before his depart­ure
for the latter city, he verbally informed the respondent judge that his return
to Iloilo might be delayed and that he might not arrive on time for the trial
of the case as set; that he called at both the law office and the residence of
the counsel for the private respondent to inform him of the desired
postponement and the reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, but the latter
was in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> at the time; that he exercised utmost
diligence and precaution in the sense that while in Manila he sent a telegram
to the respondent judge, asking for postponement; and that notwithstanding all
the foregoing, the municipal court nevertheless proceeded with the trial in his
absence and that of his client, allowed the private respondent to present his
evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>and rendered a decision against the
peti­tioner, thus depriving the latter of his day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coun­sel for the petitioner further asserted
that <span style="">his </span>client
has a good and substantial defense, which <span style="">is, </span>that the complain­ant had <span style="">given </span>his
client an option to buy the premises sub­ject-matter of the complaint below,
and that a reopening of the case would cause the private respondent no real
injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition was given due course, the respondents were required
to file their answers, and a cease-and-desist order was issued as prayed
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="2">February <span style="">22, </span>1964</st1:date>,
after <span style="">due hearing, the Court of <span style="">First </span></span><span style="">Instance </span><span style="">rendered judgment dismissing the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence the present recourse.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">From the perspective of the environmental circumstances obtaining
in this case, the present appeal is palpably <span style="">devoid </span>of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">A counsel for any party in a judicial controversy, by mandate of
the canons of legal ethics, and with due regard for the elementary standards of
fair play, is duty bound to prepare for trial with diligence and deliberate
speed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This norm of conduct <span style="">is no </span>less applicable in a <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case, such as the one at bar, even <span style="">if </span>the <span style="">issues </span>are essentially simple and
uncomplicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that the
counsel for the petitioner-appellant has been remiss in this respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for trial <span style="">six </span>times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thrice it was
postponed at the behest of the said counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last postponement was granted on <st1:date year="1963" day="24" month="7">July <span style="">24, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>with the unequivocal <span style="">admonition </span>by the judge that no
further postponement would be countenanced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case was reset for <span style="">hearing </span>on
<st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="8">August <span style="">27, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>which
means that the appellant's counsel had more than a month's time to so adjust
his schedule of activities as to obviate a conflict between his business <span style="">transactions </span>and
his calendar of <span style="">hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Came August <span style="">27, </span>and neither he nor the appellant appeared at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His absence on the latter date was not
occasioned by illness or some other supervening occurrence which unavoid­ably
and justifiably prevented him from appearing in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our <span style="">view, </span>it
was the bounden duty of the said counsel, under the circumstances, to <span style="">give </span>preferential attention to the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As things were, he regarded the
municipal court as <span style="">a mere marionette </span>that
must ever await his pleasure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
attitude on his part is censurable as it reveals more than just a modicum of
disrespect for the judiciary and the established machinery of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is his censurable conduct <span class="GramE">mitigated by</span>
the appear­ance in court on August 27 of another attorney who verbally moved
for postponement nor by his telegram received by the municipal judge on the
same date asking for continuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
circumstances, upon the contrary, emphasize his presumptuousness <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u></span> the municipal judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus crystal-clear from the foregoing disquisition that the
petitioner-appellant was not deprived of <span style="">his </span>day in court, and that the respondent municipal judge did not
err in proceeding with the trial, allowing the private respondent to <span style="">present his evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, and thereafter <span style="">rendering decision for the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the peti­tioner was not
entitled </span>to the remedy of a <span style="">petition
for re­lief.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, after the denial of <span style="">his motion </span>to set aside judgment and for <span style="">new trial, </span>the appellant had ample time to appeal; instead he
allowed the judgment to become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His argument that an appeal would have been
futile as there was no evidence upon which such appeal could be based, merits
scant consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appeal from the
decision of a municipal court to the Court of First Instance has the effect of
vacating the decision (sec. <span style="">9, </span>Rule
40, new Rules of Court; sec. <span style="">9, </span>Rule
<span style="">40, </span>of the old Rules), and the
action is to be tried <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> without regard to the proof presented
in the municipal court or the conclusions reached thereon (<span class="SpellE">Colegio</span>
de San Jose <span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,
</span>56 Phil. <span style="">344, 351; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lizo</span></span><span style=""> vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>, <span style="">73 Phil.
649; <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> vs. </span>Director of Prisons, 41
Phil. 368).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To grant the appellant's
petition for relief would amount to reviving his right to appeal which he had
irretrievably lost through the gross inaction of his counsel (see Espinosa vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, etc., et al., L-16435, <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="1">Jan. <span style="">31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>and the cases therein cited).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This in law cannot be done.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this appeal is patently frivolous and
dilatory, this Court, under the authority of section <span style="">3 </span>of Rule 142 of the Rules of Court, hereby assesses treble
costs against the petitioner-appellant <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>, said costs to be paid <span style="">by his </span>counsel, Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span>.</p>
