				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What the Constitution ordains in its avowed principle of the
promotion of social justice<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and the explicit mandate of pro­tection to labor<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was once again given concrete expression in a statute of recent date increasing
the minimum wage.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, for industrial establishments, a six pesos (P6.00) daily wage is now the
law, a two-peso <span style="">(P2.</span>00)
increase.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In view of its explicit language, it would be difficult for a business firm so
minded to escape its operation directly, whether its employees are paid on a
daily or a monthly basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, an
attempt to do so has been forestalled by a provision found in the original
Minimum Wage Law which prohibits an employer from "reducing the wage now
paid to any of his employees in excess of the minimum wage established under
[the Act] or in reducing supple­ments furnished on the date of enactment."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In this action for <span style="">declaratory relief,
petitioner-appellant Automotive Parts &amp; Equipment Company, Incorporated,
would seek to construe the above section to enable it to reduce its liability
for its monthly paid employees from P180.00 to P152.00, by paying them at the
rate of six days a week from Monday to Saturday computed at the rate of the
minimum daily wage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court was not
sympathetic to such a plea. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hence, this
appeal from its decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ought to
have known better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No court could
indulge in such an unworthy objective especially when sought to be attained by
advancing arguments of the flimsiest and most insubstantial character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the petition for
declaratory relief, the then Secretary of Labor, Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>
and the then Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards, Ruben F. Santos being
named as respondents, appellant Automotive Parts &amp; Equipment Company,
Incorporated alleged that it was duly incorporated on January 5, 1961 and that
from the start of its operation, its employees were paid on a daily and monthly
basis.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It there noted that on April 21, 1965 the
aforesaid amendatory act took effect and that respondents Secretary </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Labor and the Director of the Bureau of Labor Standards construed its
provision "in such a way as to require the petitioner to increase the
salaries of all the monthly paid employees of the petitioner to a minimum of
P180.00 (not P152.00) which according to them is the applicable minimum wage
rate for the monthly paid employees of petitioner."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After an allegation that
it had already increased the salaries of its monthly paid employees to a
minimum of P152.00 a month, in accordance with its own interpretation of the
act, it sought to justify its refusal to abide by the interpretative bulletin
of re­spondents requiring the increase to a minimum of P180.00 a month for
employees paid on a monthly basis in this wise:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That the petitioner believes that Section 19 of Republic Act No.
602 parti­cularly that portion prohibiting the reduction of wages paid to
employees in excess of the minimum wage established in the Act or supplements
theretofore granted to employees only refers and applies to employers in
business prior to and at the time of enactment of said Republic Act No. 602 and
that the prohibition thereof against reduction of supplements as envisioned in
Section 19 of Republic Act No. 602 should not be applied prospectively to
employers coming into existence subsequent to the effective date of said
Republic Act No. 602.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This belief has
not been altered despite the passage of the Amendatory Act namely Republic Act
No. 4180 particularly so because the latter act only amended one section, i.e.,
Section 3 of Republic Act No. 602 and it did not in any way repeal in its
entirety said Republic Act No. 602.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, Section 19 of Republic Act No. 602 has not been reenacted
in the Amendatory Act No. 4180 and for the Bureau of Labor now to construe the
Amendatory Act in such away as to require petitioner to increase, by
compulsion, the salaries of its monthly paid employees to a minimum of P180.00
due to a customary practice of the petitioner in considering <span class="SpellE">unworked</span> Sundays and legal holidays as a paid day, would be
beyond the clear and express provisions of the law and constitutes legislation
by the Bureau of Labor."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted, the lower court rejected such a contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Section 2 of R.A. No. 4180 provides that 'Any provision of law
previously enacted on the subject matter of this Act that is in­consistent with
any provision of this Act is hereby repealed.’ Section 19 of R.A. No. 602 not
being inconsistent with R.A. No. 4180 has not been repealed; on the other hand,
the provisions of Section 19 of R.A. No. 602 not being inconsistent with R.A.
No. 4180 were deemed and impliedly reenacted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, according to Article 1702 of the Civil Code, ‘In case of
doubt, all labor legislation and all labor contracts shall be construed in
favor of the safety and decent living for the laborer.’ This is in conso­nance
with the intention of Congress to protect the minimum wage of laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Section 19 of R.A. No. 602 prohibiting
the reduction of supplements granted to employees and the minimum wage of P6.00
a day and R.A. No. 4180 are for the purpose of securing a 'decent living for
the laborer.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision, it was
declared "that Section 19 of R. A. <span style="">No.
602 is applicable to the petitioner in connection with the enforce­ment of the
provisions of R.A. No. 4180."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From such a decision, this appeal was taken to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court decided the matter
correctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be reversed.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To state the construction
sought to be fastened on the clear and explicit language of the statute is to
reject it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It comes into collision with
the constitutional command pursuant to the social justice principle that the
government extend protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the one hand, appellant would recognize that the increase in minimum
wage was so legislatively decreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other, it would impute to the same enactment, without any support in the
statutory language, a means whereby to frustrate in part such commendable
legislative objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such intent
could rightfully be imputed to Congress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, to cast a suspicion that such a form of evasion was
legislative willed may even raise serious constitutional doubts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is un­deniable that every statute,
much more so one arising from a legislative implementation of a constitutional
mandate, must be so construed that no question as to its conformity with what
the fundamental law requires need arise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, appellant is unaware of such a basic postulate, or, if
aware; is not inclined to accord it deference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot expect approbation from any court, much less from this
Tribunal.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the plain
legislative purpose so evident on the face of the statute is not to vitalize
and implement what the Constitution enjoins, still there is no escape from an
equally authoritative principle of statutory construction that bars acceptance
on what appellant would foist upon the judiciary as an acceptable
interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted in the recent
case of <span class="SpellE">Sarcos</span> v. Castillo:<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
"It is fundamental that once the policy or purpose of the law has been ascertained,
effect should be given to it by the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From <span class="SpellE">Ty</span> Sue v. <span class="SpellE">Hord</span>,
decided in 1909, it has been our constant holding that the choice between
conflicting theories falls on that which best accords with the letter of the
law and with its purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next year,
in an equally leading decision, <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, there was a caveat against a construction
that would tend to defeat the pur­pose and object of the legislator.’ Then came
the admonition in <span class="SpellE">Riera</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Palmaroli</span>,
against an application so narrow ‘as to defeat the manifest purpose of the
legislator.’ This was repeated in the latest case, Commissioner of Customs v. <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>, in almost identical language."</p>

<p class="BODY">If the interpretation offered by appellant would be considered
acceptable, then there would be a negation of the above purpose of the
amendatory act increasing the minimum wage law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would be to defeat and frustrate rather than to foster its
policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be rejected.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The futility of the
appeal is thus apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first two assigned
errors that the lower court should not have relied on Article 1702 of the Civil
Code, which would require that in case of doubt all labor legislation should be
construed in favor of the safety and decent living for the laborer and of the
continuing of Section 19 prohibiting any interpretation of the Minimum Wage Law
that would justify the reduction of the wage then paid to any of its employees,
obviously lack merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Much less could it be
alleged that the lower court erred in disregarding the clear context of the
above Section 19, particularly the use of the word "now" and the
phrase "furnish on the date of enactment." What does it provide?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing in this Act shall deprive an
employee of the right to seek fair wages, shorter working hours and better
working conditions nor justify an employer in violating any other labor law
applicable to his employees, in reducing the wage now paid to any of his
employees in excess of the minimum wage established under this Act, or in
reducing supplements furnished on the date of enactment."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Appellant thus would have this Court accept
the view </span>that <span style="">as it began
business after the Minimum Wage Law was enacted in 1951 the above safeguard in
the act that would preclude any evasion thereof becomes nugatory because of the
presence therein of the word "now", which, for appellant, would have
the effect of limiting its application only to business establishments existing
as of the date of its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> on April 6,
1951.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant apparently is in no mood
to pay need to the constitutional command of protection to labor or to assure
that the legislative purpose be attained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would defy common sense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nothing is better settled
then that courts are not to give words a meaning which would lead to absurd or
unreasonable consequence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>That <span style="">is a principle that goes back to In re Allen</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> decided on </span><st1:date year="1903" day="29" month="10"><span style="">October 29, 1903</span></st1:date><span style="">, where it was held that a literal

apt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The fact that the construction placed

<p class="BODY">It is of the essence of judicial duty to construe statutes so as
to avoid such a deplorable result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
has long been a judicial function.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
A literal reading of a legislative act which could be thus characterized is to
be avoided if the language thereof can be given a reasonable application
consistent with the legislative purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In the apt language of Frankfurter:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"A decent respect for the policy of Congress must save us from
imputing to it <span style="">a
</span>self-defeating, if not disingenuous purpose."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Certainly, we must reject a construction that at best amounts to a
manifestation of verbal ingenuity but hardly satisfies the test of rationality
on which law must be based.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not be easy to
imagine an interpretation more clearly designed to circumvent the statute or
more transparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not require the
lower court too much effort to see through the scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It decided as it ought to having respect for
the clear statutory purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot
