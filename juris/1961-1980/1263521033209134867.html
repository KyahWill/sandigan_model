				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the Court of First Instance of Manila peti­tioner, Marina A.
Torres, was charged with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial upon a plea of not guilty,
she was convicted and sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1)
month and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">arresto</span></span><span style=""> </span>mayor
to one (1) year and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prisión</span> <span class="SpellE">cor­reccional</span>, to indemnify the offended party, Anita M. <span class="SpellE">García</span>, in the sum of P850.00, with subsidiary im­prisonment

</span>Not satisfied with the decision, she appealed to the Court of Appeals

she took the appeal now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, claiming that the
Court of Appeals committed <span style="">the

<p class="BODY">The facts found by the Court of Appeals – which may not now be
reviewed – are stated in its decision <span style="">as
</span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On August 14, 1959, Marina A. Torres received from Anita M.
Garcia, in the latter's residence at 2179 <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span>,
Sta. Ana, Manila, a white yellow gold pair of <span style="">earrings studded with 10 diamonds valued at P1<span class="GramE">,050.00</span>
to be sold for cash on an overprice commission basis, with the ob­ligation </span>to
deliver the proceeds or re­<span style="">turn the
jewelry within 30 days there­</span>after, or up to September 13, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">order
to be sure that the jewelry would </span>not be taken to another place for nego­tiation
and would always remain within <span style="">the
owner's immediate supervision, Miss </span>Garcia charged <span style="">the defendant with the </span>obligation of
reporting it at every 3-day interval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having bought this pair <span style="">of
earrings </span>from defendant Torres herself, in her capacity as agent of the
former owner, complainant did not think it necessary to demand from defendant <span style="">the execution of a </span>written acknowledg­ment
receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On her part defendant Torres
does not deny having received the pair of earrings in question nor the
conditions under which it was de­livered, although she claims it to be untrue
that a period has been fixed for its sale or return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She admitted, how­ever, that she "had
been <span style="">bringing this jewelry to Miss
Garcia very frequently </span>to report to her." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>. 18.)</span> Complainant Garcia testified that after
defendant had reported once on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="8">August
 17, 1959</st1:date> in accordance with their verbal agreement, she there­after
disappeared and failed to show up again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Disturbed by the persistent failure to locate and contact Torres at the
latter's abode during the var­ious times she had gone to defendant's address,
Garcia thereupon made efforts to ascertain the actual whereabouts of the herein
defendant in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1959</st1:date>, Garcia somehow
suc­ceeded to talk with the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order to dissipate complainant's doubts and misgivings, defendant
Torres on this occasion assured Garcia that the pair of earrings was still in
her (Torres') pos­session by explaining that, if she was not yet able to sell
the jewelry in ques­tion it was because <span style="">of
</span>factors beyond her control such as her husband's illness and
hospitalization and the change of address of the prospective buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant Garcia was so impressed by
defendant's story that she finally agreed to accom­modate her by approving her
request for an extension of 15 days, or until <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1959</st1:date>, within which to comply with the
obligation under the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1959</st1:date>, the day following
the lapse of the extension period, defendant Torres did not appear but somehow
com­plainant succeeded in communicating with her and this time she told her
(Torres) bluntly and frankly that she wanted the earrings back, otherwise
"if you cannot give me the jewelry, I will sue you." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>. 2.)</span> <span class="GramE">In
meeting this verbal demand which appeared this time to be serious and
determined, defendant Torres again endeavored to soothe Miss Garcia's dis­quietude,
saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Don't worry because the
money is with me already; only I can­not come because my husband is still in
the hospital."</span> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>.
2.)</span> Fifteen days after the expiration of the extended pe­riod, or, to be
exact, on October 15, 1959, instead of coming in person to offer the proceeds
of the sale or to re­turn the earrings to the complainant, the herein defendant
sent over her sister, Mrs. Rosario <span class="SpellE">Fariña</span>, to plead
with the complainant for a further extension, intimating at the same time the
futil­ity of a criminal prosecution in view of the fact that defendant Torres
must have misused the proceeds of the sale in connection with her husband's
illness and hospitalization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
plea by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fariña</span> on behalf of her sister, the
record failed to show that complain­ant yielded to the supplication.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finding herself in quandary, with a criminal prosecution dangling
over her head, defendant Torres was constrained to appear at Garcia's residence
on <st1:date year="1959" day="13" month="11">Nov­ember 13, 1959</st1:date>,
that was 1 month and 13 days after the extension had lapsed, to plead with the
latter to please accept a promissory note for the value of the jewelry in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accompanied by Mrs. Rosario <span class="SpellE">Fariña</span>, her sister, the latter offered <span class="GramE">herself</span>
to act as guarantor for Torres' liability in the pro­posed promissory
note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first the complainant was not
disposed to accept the proffer but when defendant Torres confessed to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, Miss
Garcia's counsel, that she had in fact used the proceeds of the sale for her
husband's medical treatment, she finally decided to follow Atty. <span class="SpellE">Atienza's</span> advice by accepting promissory note Ex­hibit 1
which defendant and her sister signed on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the terms of the promissory note,
defendant Torres specifically admits that the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,050.00</span>
therein contained is "the value of the diamond earrings which Mrs. Marina
Torres received from <span style="">Miss Garcia </span><span style="">on consignment to be sold with the obli­gation
to return said earrings or the proceeds of the same." While the prom­issory
note provides for the payment of the aforesaid amount in four installments of
(a) P300.00 on November 20; (b) P250.00 on December 20; (c) P250.00 on January
20, 1960; and (d) P250.00 on February 20, 1960, yet it is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
fact that the herein defendant only paid the sum of P200.00 on November 14
(Exhibit 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, during the trial,
defendant Torres was asked why she did not comply with the pro­missory note
Exhibit 1, all she could mum­ble by way of an elusive answer was to blame
complainant Garcia for having filed a case against her in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. 16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this explanation is without merit, for
the record of this case shows that the information which brought about the
present criminal prosecution was not filed until </span><st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="9"><span style="">Sep­tember 27, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, almost a year after the execution of the
promissory note (Exhibit 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Annex "A"; Appellants' brief. pp. 21-25 Italics
ours)."</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the errors allegedly committed by the Court of Appeals, it
is clear that the following are the only questions to be resolved:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, whether upon the evidence of record,
petitioner may be held guilty of the consummated crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>;
secondly, whether or not petitioner may still be held criminally liable after
the execution by her of a promissory note – now in the record as Exhibit 1 – in
payment of the value of the earrings studded with diamonds subject matter of
the criminal offense she was charged with and found guilty of, by the Court of
First Instance of Manila and by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention in connection with the first issue is
that the Court of Appeals did not make any positive finding of fact regarding
the conversion or misappropriation by her of the earrings mentioned heretofore,
for which reason she was erroneously convicted of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
contrary to the ruling laid down in <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> vs.
People, 74 Phil. 63.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the above contention to be without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the decision of Court of
Appeals that it actually found and declared that on October 1, 1959 when the
complainant was told by the offended party that she would charge her criminally
in court if she did not give back the earrings delivered to her for sale or its
value, petitioner told her not to worry because she had the money already;
"only I cannot come because my husband is still in the hospital." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 2).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then on October 15 of the same year, instead of seeing the
complaining witness in person to deliver the alleged proceeds of the sale of
the jewelry or to return the latter, petitioner sent over her sister, Mrs.
Rosario <span class="SpellE">Fariña</span>, to plead with the complaining witness
for a further extension, her sister intimat­ing at the same time the futility
of any criminal pro­secution, because petitioner must have misused the proceeds
of the sale due to the illness and hospital­ization of her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on a subsequent occasion, faced with the serious threat of
a criminal prosecution, petitioner <span style="">was
constrained to personally see the complaining wit­</span><span style="">ness on November 13, 1959, that </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">more than one month after the expiration of the extension granted to
her, on which occasion she pleaded with her to accept a promissory note for the
value of the jewelry in question, payment of which would be guaranteed by her
sister, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fariña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaining witness, at first, </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">not disposed to accept such proposal, but when peti­tioner confessed to
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>,
com­plaining witness' counsel, that she had, in fact, <u>used</u> the proceeds
of the sale of the earrings to defray the expenses of her </span><span style="">husband's </span><span style="">medical treatment, she finally accepted the promissory note.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon these facts
petitioner </span><span style="">argues that </span><span style="">her </span><span style="">lia­</span><span style="">bility, if any, was reduced to a mere civil liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the promissory note was executed,
it is clear that petitioner had already committed the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, so that even full payment of the value of the piece
of jewelry misappropriated by her could not extinguish her criminal
liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following decisions on
this matter clearly show peti­tioner's contention to be without merit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">Subsequent agreements between the par<span style="">ties </span>with respect to the civil
liability arising from the commission of a crime does</span> not affect the
right of the government to prosecute the criminal notwithstanding com­plete
restitution of the property injured." (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mendozana</span>, 2 Phil. 353, 376).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is well settled in this jurisdic­tion that payment made
subsequent to the commission of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
does not alter the nature of the crime committed, nor does it relieve defendant
from the pen­alty prescribed by law." (Javier vs. People, 70 Phil. 550,
552-553).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The reimbursement of the amount embezzled exempts the accused
only from civil liability." <span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Velazco</span>, 42 Phil. 75 81)."</span></blockquote>
