				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila dated October 24, 1963 in civil case 52434, ordering the
defendants-appellants to pay to the Bank of the Philippine Islands (hereinafter
referred to as the Bank), jointly and severally, the value of the credit it
extended to them in several letters of credit which the Bank opened at the
behest of the defendants-appellants to finance their importation of dyestuffs
from the United States, which however turned out to be mere colored chalk upon
arrival and inspection thereof at the port of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on four (4) different occasions in 1961,
the De <span class="SpellE">Reny</span> Fabric Industries, Inc., a Philippine
corporation, through its co-defendants-appellants, Aurora <span class="SpellE">Carcereny</span>,
<u>alias</u> Aurora C. Gonzales, and Aurora T. <span class="SpellE">Tuyo</span>,
president and secretary, respectively of the corporation, applied to the Bank
for four <span style="">(4) </span>irrevocable
commercial letters of credit to cover the purchase by the corporation of goods
described in the covering L/C applications as "dyestuffs of various
colors" from its American supplier, the J.B. Distributing Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the applica<span style="">tions of the corporation were approved, and the corresponding
Commercial L/C agreements were executed pursuant to banking procedures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these agreements, the aforementioned
offi<span style="">cers </span>of the corporation
bound themselves personally as joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
debtors with the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
to banking regulations then in force, the corporation <span style="">delivered to </span>the Bank peso marginal deposits as each letter of
credit was opened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as well as the peso marginal deposits made were, respectively, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the foregoing transactions, the Bank issued
irrevocable commercial letters of credit addressed to its correspondent banks
in the United States, with uniform <span style="">instructions
</span>for them to notify the beneficiary thereof, the J.B. Distributing Company,
that they have been authorized to <span style="">negotiate
the latter's </span>sight drafts up to the amounts mentioned therein,
respectively, if accompanied, upon presentation, by a full <span style="">set </span>of negotiable clean <span style="">"on board" ocean bills of lading,
covering the merchandise appearing in the L/Cs, that is, dyestuffs of various
colors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the J.B.
Distributing Company <span style="">drew upon,
presented to and negotiated with these </span>banks, <span style="">its sight drafts covering the amounts </span>of the merchandise
ostensibly being <span style="">exported by it, together
with </span>clean <span style="">bills </span>of
lading, and collected <span style="">the full value </span>of
the drafts up to the amounts appearing <span style="">in
</span>the L/Cs </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">above <span style="">indicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These </span>correspondent banks then <span style="">deb</span></span><span style="">i</span><span style="">ted
the account of the Bank of the Philippine </span><span style="">Islands with <span style="">them up to the
full value </span>of the drafts presented by the J.B. <span style="">Distributing Company, plus commission there­on, </span>and, thereafter,
endorsed <span style="">and forwarded all </span>documents
to the Bank of the Philippine <span style="">Islands.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, as each shipment (covered by the above-mentioned
letters of credit) arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the De <span class="SpellE">Reny</span> Fabric Industries, Inc. made partial
payments to the Bank amounting, in the aggregate, to P90<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further payments were, however, subsequently
discontinued by the corporation when it became established, as a result of a
chemical test co<span style="">nduct</span><span style="">ed by the</span><span style=""> National Science Development Board, that the </span><span style="">goods that arrived in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> were colored chalks instead of dyestuffs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The corporation also refused to <span style="">take possession </span>of these goods, and for this reason, the Ba<span style="">nk caused them to be deposited </span>with a
bonded warehouse paying <span class="SpellE"><span style="">therefor</span></span><span style=""> </span>the
amount of P12<span class="GramE">,609.64</span> up to the filing of its complaint
with the court below <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1962</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 24, 1963 the lower court rendered its decision
ordering the corporation and its co-defendants (the herein appellants) to pay
to the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span style="">the amount of P291,</span>807.46, with interest thereon, as provided <span style="">for in </span>the L/C Agreements, at the rate
of 7% per annum from October 31, 1962 Until fully paid, plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the submission of the defendants-appellants that it was the
duty of the foreign correspondent banks of the Bank of the Philippine Islands
to take the necessary precautions to insure that the goods shipped under the
covering L/Cs conformed with the item appearing therein, and, that the foreign
banks having failed <span style="">to perform this
duty, no claim for <span class="SpellE">recoupment</span> against the
defendants-appellants, arising from the losses incurred for the non-delivery or
defective delivery of the articles ordered, could accrue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We can appreciate the sweep of the appellants, argument, but we
also find that it is nestled hopelessly inside a salient where the valid
contract between the parties <span style="">and the
internationally </span>accepted customs of the banking trade must prevail.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the terms of their Commercial Letter of Credit Agreements
with the <span style="">B</span>ank,
the appellants agreed that the Bank shall not be responsible for the
"existence, character, quality, quantity, conditions, packing, value, or
delivery of the property purporting to be represented by documents; for any
difference in character, quality, quantity, condition, or value of the property
from that expressed in documents," or for “partial or incom­plete
shipment, or failure or omission to ship any or all of the property referred to
in the Credit," as well as "for any deviation from instructions,
delay, default or fraud by the shipper or anyone else in connection with the
property or the shipping thereof, " and "for any breach of contract
between the <span style="">shippers
or vend</span>ors and ourselves, [purchasers] or any of us."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having agreed to these terms, the appellants
have, therefore, no recourse but to comply with their covenant.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But even without the stipulation recited above, the appel­lants
cannot shift the burden of loss to the Bank on account of the violation by<span style=""> </span>their
vendor of its <span class="SpellE">prestation</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was incontrovertibly proven by the <span style="">B</span>ank during the trial below that
banks, in<span style=""> </span>providing
financing in international business transactions such as those entered into by
the appellants, do not deal with the property to be exported or shipped <span style="">to </span>the
importer, but deal only with documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Bank introduced in evidence a provision contained in the
"Uniform Customs and Practices for Commercial Documentary Credits Fixed
for the Thirteenth Congress of International Chamber of Commerce," to
which the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a signatory nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 10
thereof provides:</p>

<blockquote><u>"In documentary credit operations, all parties concerned
deal in documents and not in goods.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Payment, negotiation or acceptance against <span style="">docum</span>ents in accordance with the terms and conditions <span style="">of </span>a credit
by<span style=""> </span>a Bank <span style="">authorized to do so <span class="GramE">binds</span>
the </span>party given the authorization to take up the documents and reimburse
the <span style="">B</span>ank making the payment,
negotiation or acceptance."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The existence of a custom <span style="">in international banking and </span>financing
circles negating any duty <span style="">on </span>the Part of a bank to verify whether what has been described in
<span style="">letters of
credits or drafts or </span>shipping documents actually tallies with what was
loaded aboard ship, having b<span style="">e</span>en positively proven as a fact, the appellants are bound by this
established usage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were, after all,
the ones who tapped the facilities afforded by the Bank in order to engage in
international business.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is affirmed,
at defendants-appellants’ cost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
without prejudice to the Bank, in proper proceedings in the court below in this
same case, proving and being reimbursed additional <span style="">expenses, if any, it has incurred b</span>y
virtue of the continued storage of the goods in question up to the time this
decision becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

The power of our courts to accept in evidence, international custom as evidence
of a <span style="">general practice </span>accepted <span style="">as law, may </span>be said to be derived from
both Constitutional as well as statutory sources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3, Article II of the Constitution
provides that "The <span style="">Philippines </span>renounces
war as an instrument of national policy, and adopts the generally accepted
principles of international law as a part of the law of the Nation."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Art. 9 of the New Civil Code provides that
"No court or judge shall <span style="">decline
to</span> render<span style=""> </span>judgment by
reason of the silence, obscurity or <span style="">insufficiency
of </span><span style="">the </span>law," and
Art. 12 of the same Code <span class="GramE">provides</span> that <span style="">"A cu</span>stom
must be proved as a fact, according to the rules of evidence." The Code of
Commerce, in its Article 2, likewise provides <span style="">that </span><span style="">"A</span><span style="">cts of commerce,
whether those who execute them be merchants or not, and whether specified in
this Code or not, should be governed <span style="">by
the provisions </span>contained in it, <span style="">in

all others of analogous character, shall be deemed acts of commerce."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that certain principles
governing the issuance, acceptance and payment of letters of credit are specifically
provided for in the Code of Commerce.</p>
