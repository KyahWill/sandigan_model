<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In a decision rendered by the 
Court of First Instance of La Union on November 29, 1960, Marcos and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span>, father and son, 
were ordered to vacate the land in litigation, as well as to pay to Santiago R. 
<span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> the amount of P100.00 a year from 1959 until 
the land is actually delivered, plus the sum of P600.00 as attorney's fees and 
other expenses of litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">When this decision became final 
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> asked 
for a writ of execution and pursuant thereto the sheriff levied on two parcels 
of land allegedly belonging to defendants <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span>, as 
well as a house covered by Tax Declaration No. 30715 which at the time was 
occupied by Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span> as his residential house, 
with the result that the properties thus levied upon were sold at public auction 
to <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> as the highest bidder. The <span class="SpellE">Bambicos</span> failed to redeem the properties within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of one year and so the sheriff executed 
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> the corresponding final 
certificate of sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 20, 1963, after <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> had taken possession of the two parcels of land, as 
well as the house then occupied by Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> asked the court that the sheriff be authorized 
to supervise the demolition of the house to avoid any opposition or incident 
that might arise <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, which request was set by 
the court for hearing. In due course, the <span class="SpellE">Bambicos</span> 
objected to the demolition contending that they are not the owners neither of 
the two pieces of land nor of the house which was the subject of execution, but 
their opposition was overruled in spite of their plea that there was already a 
case pending before the same court wherein the ownership of the properties was 
put in issue. And when their motion for reconsideration was denied, one <span class="SpellE">Zoila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span>, who claimed to be 
the wife of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span> and the owner of the 
properties in question, brought the matter on a petition for certiorari before 
the Court of Appeals. In a decision rendered on </span><st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1962"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 27, 
1962</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
Court of Appeals granted the writ prayed for thereby setting aside the order of 
demolition issued by the court <i>a quo</i>. Tine case is now before us on a 
petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">While there is no dispute that 
the two pieces of land and the residential house that were sold at public 
auction by the sheriff to satisfy the final judgment rendered in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case appear declared in the tax declaration in the 
name of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span>, the fact however remains t 
their <span class="GramE">ownership</span> appears contested by <span class="SpellE">Zoila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span>, wife of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span>, in an action for annulment she seasonably brought 
before the court <i>a quo</i> in an effort to prove that they were not the 
exclusive properties of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span> but were 
conjugal in nature acquired during their marital life (Civil Case No. 1744). It 
is true that when they were levied in execution neither Marcos <span class="SpellE">Bambico</span> nor <span class="SpellE">Zoila</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span> filed any claim with the sheriff in order to assert 
their ownership over the properties levied upon, but this is only necessary if 
they desire to stop the execution by putting up the necessary bond in favor of 
the sheriff, but the absence of such claim will not necessarily stop them from 
claiming the properties in an appropriate separate action (Section 17, Rule 39, 
Rules of Court). And this is precisely what the <span class="SpellE">Bambicos</span> did. They seasonably brought an action to annul the 
whole execution proceedings by making party to the case not only the execution 
creditor but also the sheriff. And notwithstanding the fact that such action was 
already pending in court when said creditor moved to demolish the residential 
house of the <span class="SpellE">Bambicos</span>, the court <i>a quo</i> ignored 
their plea and gave the go signal for the requested demolition. This was found 
by the Court of Appeals to be improper, since it is but fair that before the 
demolition could be effected the <span class="SpellE">Bambicos</span> be at least 
given a chance to be heard concerning the interest they claim to possess on said 
properties. To this finding we fully agree. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
