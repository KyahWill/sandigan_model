				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental in its Civil Case No. 7355, ordering the
San Miguel Brewery, Inc. to pay to the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
the sum of P36,519.10, representing surcharges on certain fees which, under
existing ordinances of the City of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>, the San
Miguel Brewery should have paid quarterly to the treasurer of the said city for
and/or during the period from July, 1959 to December, 1962, but which <span style="">were paid only on April 23, 1963.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February </span>17,
1949, the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> passed Ordinance
No. 66, series of 1949 imposing upon "any person, firm or corporation
engaged in the manu<span style="">facture of bottling
of coca cola, <span class="SpellE">pepsi</span> cola, <span class="SpellE">tru</span>

whole year", upon "such local manu­facturers or bottlers
above-mentioned who will be delin­quent on any amount of fees due" under
the ordinance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In 1959, this ordinance
was amended by Ordinance No. 150, series of 1959, by increasing the fee to
"one-eight (1/8) of a centavo for every bottle thereof".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the fee was increased from
P0.01 to P0.03 per </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">of soft drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant refused to pay the additional fee
and challenged the validity of the whole ordinance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ordinance No. 150, Series of 1959, which took effect on July 1, 1959, only paid

1959, as well as the sum of P26,306.54 representing unpaid bottling taxes due
with legal rate of interest thereon from the date of the filing of this
complaint until complete payment thereof; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> costs, etc."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In due time, appellant filed its answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by a stipulation of facts
between the parties, whereupon, the court rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1960</st1:date>, with the
following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. is ordered to pay to the
plaintiff the sum of P26,306.54 and the tax at the rate of three centavos per
case levied in Ordinance No. 66 and 150 from March, 1960, and thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant appealed from the said decision to this Court where it
pressed the question of the invalidity of the above-mentioned taxing
ordinances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that appeal (G. R. No.
18290), however, this Court affirmed the decision appealed from and upheld the
constitutionality of the questioned ordinances and the authority of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appel</span>lee</span>
to enact the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons not
extant <span style="">in the
record, </span>it was already after this decision had become final when <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> moved for the reconsideration thereof, praying
that the same be amended so as to include the penalties and surcharges provided
for in the ordinances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, the
said motion was denied, for the reason that "the decision is already final
and may not be amended". <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When
execution was had before the lower court, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appel</span><span style="">lee</span></span><span style=""> </span>again sought the inclusion of the
surcharges referred to; and once again the move was frustrated by the Court<span style=""> </span>of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental which denied the motion, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<blockquote>"Acting upon the motion dated October 24, 1963, filed by the
Assistant City Fiscal, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rallos</span>,
counsel for the plaintiff, and the opposition thereto filed by attorneys for
the defendants dated November 9, 1963, as well as the reply to the opposition <span style="">of counsel for the defendants dated December
5, 1963, taking into consideration that the decision of this Court as affirmed
by </span>the Supreme <span style="">Court does not
specifically </span>mention <span style="">the alleged
surcharges claimed by the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the
Court hereby resolves to deny, as it hereby denies, the aforesaid motion, for
not </span>being <span style="">meritorious."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Failing thus in its <span style="">attempt
to collect the surcharges provided for in the </span>ordinances in <span style="">question, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed a second </span>action (Civil Case No. 7355) to <span style="">collect the said surcharges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under date of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="7"><span style="">July 10, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, it filed the corresponding complaint before

portion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW THEREOF, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the
defendant San Mi­guel Brewery, Inc. to pay to the plain­tiff the sum of
P36,519.10 representing the surcharges as provided in section 4 of Ordinance
66, series of 1949 of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants moved for reconsideration but its motion was denied,
hence, the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant has only one
assignment of </span>error, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN FINDING THE APPELLANT LIABLE TO THE APPELLEE FOR THE SUM OF P36,519.10
REPRESENT­ING SURCHARGES AS PROVIDED IN TAX OR­DINANCE NO. 66, SERIES OF 1949,
AS A­MENDED, OF THE CITY OF <st1:city><st1:place>BACOLOD</st1:place></st1:city>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under this, it argues that the action of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
can­not be maintained because (1) a party may not institute more than one suit
for a single cause of action; and (2) <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span>
action for recovery of the surcharges in question is barred by prior judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find appellant's position essentially correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="">no </span>question that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> split up its
cause of action when it filed the first complaint on March 23, 1960, seeking
the recovery of only the bottling taxes or charges plus legal interest, without
mentioning in any manner the surcharges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule on the matter is clear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 2 of the Rules of Court of 1940 which were
still in force then provided:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Splitting <span style="">a </span>cause of act­ion, forbidden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A single cause of action cannot be split up
into two or more parts so as to be made the subject of different complaints.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Effect of
splitting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If separate complaints were
brought for different parts of a single cause of <span style="">action, the filing </span>of the first may be pleaded in abatement of the
others, and a judgment upon the merits in either is available as a bar in the
others."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, this rule against the splitting up of a cause <span style="">of action is </span>an old one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it preceded the Rules <span style="">of Court or any </span>statutory
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
Motor Co., <span style="">Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Icarañgal</span>,
et al.</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court already explained <span style="">its
meaning, </span>origin and purpose thus:</p>

<blockquote>"But, even if we have no such sect­<span style="">ion </span>708 of our Code of Civil Procedure, or section 59 of the
Insolvency Law, we have still the rule against splitting a single cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule, though not contained
in any statutory provision, has been applied by this court in all appropriate
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">in </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> vs. <span class="SpellE">Moir</span> (36 Phil. 350, 339), <span style="">we said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It is well recognized
that a party cannot split a single cause of action into </span>parts and <span style="">sue </span>on each
part <span style="">separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A </span>complaint for the recovery of
personal property with damages for detention states a single cause of action
which cannot be divided <span style="">into an action </span>for
possession and one for <span style="">damages; and if
suit is </span>brought for pos<span style="">session
only a subsequent </span>action cannot <span style="">be
maintained </span>to recover the damages resulting from the <span style="">unlawful detention.' In Rubio de <span class="SpellE">Larena</span> vs. </span>Villanueva (53 Phil. 923, 927), we
reiterated the <span style="">rule by stating that 'x
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> a party will </span>not be permitted to split up
a single <span style="">cause </span>of action and
make it the <span style="">basis for several suits' </span>and
that when <span style="">a </span><span style="">lease provides </span>for the payment of the
rent in separate installments, each installment constitutes an independent <span style="">cause </span>of action, but when, at the time
the complaint is filed, there are <span style="">several
installments due, </span>all of them constitute a single cause of action and
should be included in a single complaint , and if some of them are not so
included, they are barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
doctrine <span style="">is </span>stated, in <span class="SpellE">Lavarro</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Labitoria</span> (54 Phil.
788), wherein we said that 'a party will not be permitted to split up a single
cause of action and make it a basis for several suits' and that a claim for
partition of real property as well as for improvements constitutes a single
cause of action, and a complaint for partition alone bars a subsequent
complaint for the improvements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in
Blossom &amp; Co. vs. Manila Gas Corporation (55 Phil. 226, 240), we held that
'as a general rule a contract to do several things at several times is
divisible in its nature, so <span style="">as </span>to
authorize successive actions; and a judgment recovered for a single breach of a
continuing contract or covenant <span style="">is </span>no bar to a suit for a subsequent breach
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where the covenant or
contract is entire, and the breach total, there can be only one action, and
plaintiff must therein recover all his damages.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rule against splitting a single cause of action is
intended 'to prevent repeated litigation between the same parties in regard to
the same subject of controversy; to protect defendant from unnecessary
vexation; and to avoid the costs and expenses incident to numerous suits.' (1
C. J., 1107) It comes from that old maxim <span class="SpellE"><u>nemo</u></span><u>
</u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">deb</span></u><u><span style="">et</span></u></span><u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">bis</span> <span class="SpellE">vexare</span> p</span></u><u><span style="">ro
</span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">una</span></u></span><u><span style=""> et <span class="SpellE">eadem</span> <span class="SpellE">causa</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>(no
man shall be twice vexed for one and the same cause).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>Lange, 18. Wall. 163, 168; 21 Law. ed.,
872.; also <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">vs. </span>Throckmorton, 98 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
61; 25 Law. ed., 93.) And it developed, certainly not as an original legal
right of the defendant, but as an interposition of courts upon principles of
public policy to prevent inconvenience and hardship incident to repeated and
unnecessary litigations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1 C. J.,
1107)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these precedents, it cannot be denied that
appellant's failure to pay the bottling charges or taxes and the surcharges for
delinquency in the payment thereof constitutes but one single cause of action
which under the above rule can be the subject of only one complaint, under pain
of either of them being barred if not included in the same complaint with the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The error of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
springs from a misconception or a vague comprehension of the elements of a
cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The classical
definition of a cause of action is that it is "a <span class="SpellE">delict</span>
or wrong by which the rights of the plaintiff are violated by the
defendant." Its elements may be generally stated to be (1) a right exist­ing
in favor of the plaintiff; (2) a corresponding obliga­tion on the part of the
defendant to respect such right; and (3) an act or omission of the plaintiff
which constitutes a violation of the plaintiff's right which defendant had the
duty to respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes, however,
of the rule against splitting up of a cause of action, a clearer understanding
can be achieved, if together with these elements, the right to relief is
considered.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the last analysis, a cause of action is basically an act or an
omission or several acts or omissions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
<span style="">sin­</span>gle act or omission can be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of various rights <span style="">at </span>the same time, as when the act constitutes <span class="SpellE">juridically</span> a violation of several separate and distinct
legal obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happens, for
example, when a passenger of a com­mon carrier, such as a taxi, is injured in a
collision there­of with another vehicle due to the negligence of the respective
drivers of both vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a
case, several rights of the passenger are violated, <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, (1) the right to be safe from the negligent
acts of either or both the drivers under the law on culpa-<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>
or quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>; (2) the right to be safe from
criminal negligence of the said drivers under the penal laws; and (3) the right
to be safely conduct­ed to his destination under the contract of carriage and
the law covering the same, not counting anymore the provisions of Article 33 of
the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The violation of each of
these rights is a cause of action in itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, such a passenger has at least three causes of action arising from
the same act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it can
happen also that several acts or omissions may violate only one right, in which
case, there would be only one cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the violation of a single right may give rise to more than one
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, for a single
cause of action or violation of a right, the plaintiff may be entitled to several
<span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the filing of separate complaints for these several <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
that constitutes splitting up of the cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what is prohibited by the rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, when appellant failed and refused to pay the
difference in bottling charges from July 1, 1959, such act of appellant in
violation of the right of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to be paid said
charges in full under the Ordinance, was one single cause of action, but under
the Ordinance, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> became entitled, as a result
of such non-payment, to two <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the recovery of the balance of the basic
charges; and (2) the payment of the corresponding surcharges, the latter being
merely a consequence of the failure to pay the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, the obligation of
appellant to pay the surcharges arose from the violation by said appellant of
the same right of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from which the obligation
to pay the basic charges also arose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon these facts, it is obvious that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has filed separate complaints for each of two <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
related to the same single cause of action, thereby splitting up the said cause
of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that inasmuch <span style="">as </span>there was no demand in the
complaint in the first case for the payment of the surcharges, unlike in the
case of Collector of Internal Revenue vs. <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
Gutierrez, et al., G. R. No. L-13819, <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="5">May
 25, 1960</st1:date>, wherein there was such a demand, there <span style="">is no </span>bar by
prior judgment as to said surcharges, the same not having been "raised as
an issue or cause of action in Civil Case No. 5693." This holding <span style="">is </span>erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4 of Rule 2, above-quoted, <span style="">is unmistakably </span><span style="">clear </span><span style="">as to the </span>effect
of the splitting up of <span style="">a </span>cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
says, "if separate complaints are brought for different parts (<span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>) of a single cause of action, the filing of the
first (complaint) may be pleaded in abatement <span style="">of the </span>others, and <span style="">a </span>judgment
upon the merits in either is available as a bar in the others." In other
words, whenever a plaintiff has filed more than one complaint for the same
violation of a right, the filing of the first complaint on any of the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> born of the <span style="">said violation constitutes </span><span style="">a bar to any </span><span style="">action on </span>any
of the other possible <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> arising from the same
violation, whether the first action <span style="">is still pending, in which event, the defense to the
subsequent complaint would be <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span>, or it </span><span style="">has already been </span><span style="">finally terminated,
in which case, the defense would be <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendentia</u></span>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">adjudicata</span></u></span><span style="">,</span> on the <span style="">one </span>hand, and splitting up a cause of <span style="">action on </span>the other, are not separate and distinct defenses,
since either of the former is <span style="">by </span>law
only the result or effect of the latter, or, better said, the sanction for <span style="">or behind it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It thus results that the
judgment of the lower court must be, </span>as it <span style="">is </span>hereby, reversed and the complaint of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

The corresponding provision in the Revised Rules of 1964 expresses these points
more specifically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 of Rule 2
provides:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES">"If two or more complaints are brought for different
parts of a single cause of action, the filing of the first may be pleaded in
abatement of the other or others, in accordance with section 1 (e), Rule 16,
(on <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another action) and a judgment upon
the merits in any one <span style="">is </span>available
as a bar in the others." <span class="SpellE">altho</span> the writer of
this opinion feels that a happier wording would <span style="">be:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES">"A single cause of action cannot be the subject of more
than one complaint."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
