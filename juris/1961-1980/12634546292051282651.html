				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is before Us anew on a motion for reconsideration filed
by plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the decision promulgated on April 27,
1967, We absolved d<span style="">efendants </span>City of Manila and the Director of Public Works from
liability to plaintiff for the materials taken from the gravel pit but declared
all that portion of the said area to the west, starting from a line 20 meters
east of the <span class="SpellE">camachile</span> tree, as still part of plaintiff's
property,</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his motion, plaintiff s<span style="">ubmits the fol</span>lowing grounds: (1) the Supreme Court cannot make
new <span style="">findings </span>of fact unless
those made by the lower court were in abuse of discretion or <span style="">were </span>manifestly
mistaken, absurd or impossible; (2) the area where defendants extracted gravel
and sand is plaintiff's property, and (3) there is no "secondary
bank" above (to the west of) the New Accretion Area.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is only when the issues raised in the appeal a purely
questions of law that the Supreme Court is bound to respect the findings of
fact the lower court, in the absence of abuse of discretion, or patent mistake,
absurdity or impossibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
appeal here involve questions of fact which required Us to review the entire
evidence<span style=""> o</span>n record and state the
facts as established thereby.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff himself questioned and assailed lower court's finding that
only the northern 2/5 of that <span style="">area in
question remained as his property,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and asserted that defendants extracted
materials from within his pro</span>perty and not from the riverbed and/or
riverbank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, We had to determine precisely where the peripheries of plaintiff's
property were, <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> those of the moving western
bank, and where defendants extracted materials from 1945 to 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of fact We stated in the
decision sought to be recon­sidered were all based on the evidence on record,
with <span style="">the necessary references and
citations thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could not simply
review the facts found by the lower court unfavorable to the plaintiff and
accept those favorable to him especially because the defendants also appealed
from the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">W</span><span style="">ithal, a new finding of fact had to be made
when a </span>review of the entire evidence on record showed (1) that <span style="">there was nothing to support the lower
court's conclusion that the site where rice and corn were found in the <span class="SpellE">occular</span> inspection of June 15, 1951 was on the northern 2</span><span style="">/5 </span>potion and, furthermore, not being
properly delineated, such determination would be impossible of proper execution;
(2) that defendants did not cause the unnatural widening of the River, contrary
to the lower court's holding; and (3) that defendants did not extract
indiscriminately from <span style="">area in question
during tee entire period of their </span>operations, but confined themselves to
definite areas during particular periods of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court failed to make a finding in
conformity with this established fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second ground, plaintiff argues that even as<span style=""> </span>early as 1945, the gravel <span style="">pit was </span>already
high <span style="">since </span>it
was not reached by the ordinary floods and, hence, it could not be considered a
part of the west riverbank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff
relies, however, on Cruz' report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-Calalang)
stating that from 1950 to 1951, the higher portions of the gravel pit, <u><span style="">"which used to be submerged",</span></u><span style=""> </span>were no longer inundated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is undeniable proof that before 1950,
even the higher portions which plaintiff is refer­ring to were covered by the
ordinary floods accompanying the swelling of the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the non-inundation of the higher
areas during the period 1950-1951 was part­ly due to the movement of the river
to the east.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It was this eastward movement that caused the periphery of the west bank to
recede eastward also until it was located at 20 meters west of the <span class="SpellE">camachile</span> tree during this period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff would also
refer Us to a portion of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Suiza's</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">testimony</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> purportedly showing that this witness did
not</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">see the River flooded from 1946 to 1949, in
contradiction to Our finding that <span class="SpellE">Suiza</span> stated that
from 1947 to 1949, the disputed area was always inundated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the portion alluded to, however, <span class="SpellE">Suiza</span> stated that it was perhaps three years after 1945
(when he started working in the plant) - or in </span><span style="">1948 - </span><span style="">when he first saw
the River flooded, and the second time was on the following year, or in
1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, the assumption sought to
be drawn - erroneous as it is - based on <u>what </u></span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Suiza</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">did not see</span></u><span style="">, cannot
overcome the positive </span><span style="">statements
of witnesses Ross </span><span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-Calalang.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regarding the last
point:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of </span><span style="">all, </span><span style="">We stated in the decision sought to be reconsidered, that the phrase
"secondary bank line" was a mere convenient designation only, for
identification purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">used to refer to a lateral zone west of the New Accretion Area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We al­so made it clear that the </span><span style="">periphery </span><span style="">of the west bank was more or </span><span style="">less </span><span style="">in that portion where
the "secondary bank line" was indicated only from 1945 to 1949, when
the River was itself along the New Accretion Area site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, this periphery receded </span><span style="">eastward, </span><span style="">together with the River.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Secondly, We emphasized
the point that the reason defendants were being absolved from liability was due
to the absence of sufficient evidence showing that they ex­tracted materials
beyond the receding periphery of the west bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">they who followed the eastward movement of
the river and </span><span style="">its western </span><span style="">bank, not </span><span style="">vice-versa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In </span><span style="">fact, what the evidence on record reveals is
that defendants were prevented from conducting operations beyond the outer
borders of the western bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
present motion, plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence on re­cord to show
the contrary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thirdly, the evidence
pointed to in support of this ground, had already been passed upon and
considered by Us and no new matter of substantial significance is being, brought
forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We already stated that
defendants' wit­nesses were more qualified and acquainted with the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the disputed area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Witnesses Lorenzo, Angeles and <span class="SpellE">San­tamaria</span> are
not geologists and it has not been shown that they were always </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the disputed area while defendants'</span> <span style="">operations </span><span style="">were going
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The portion of Ross' testimony</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> on the extent reached by the ordinary floods
refers to the year 1954 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The height
of the gravel pit as agreed upon in the ocular inspection of </span><st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="6"><span style="">June 15,
 1951</span></st1:date><span style=""> cannot be considered
conclusive since <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-Calalang reports that after
the typhoons of 1952 the level </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">the pit increased again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the motion to reconsider is hereby</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">denied. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
