 26, 1960</st1:date>, an aged couple, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>, 90 years old, and <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Puyod</span>, 85 years old, became the victims of a
robbery-killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said couple, sleeping
alone in their house at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sandayong</span>,
barrio <span class="SpellE">Casul</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalaga</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental</st1:placename></st1:place>, were
beaten with a club and/or a ball hammer, causing their subsequent death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some money in the amount of P800.00, more or
less, were taken from their place, i.e., their trunk, bamboo tubes filled with
coins and a small cotton bag.</p>

<p class="BODY">Report of the crime reached <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> P.
Ho, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalaga</span>,
in the morning of <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Police Chief, accompanied by the
municipal judge, the municipal health officer, PC <span class="SpellE">soldeirs</span>
and po­licemen, went to the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arriving at around 10:30 A.M., the Police Chief and his
companions found inside the aforementioned house, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>,
already dead and in partial rigor mortis; <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span>,
however, was found still alive, but unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later, she died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nobody was arrested for the said offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost <u>one and a half years later</u>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1962</st1:date>, one Crispin Javier
was arrested for theft of coconuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Po­lice Chief, however, acting on a suspicion, investigated him about the robbery-killing
of the aged couple, imputing the crime against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said investigation resulted in the signing by
Crispin Javier of an affidavit dated <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="10">October
 30, 1962</st1:date>, Exhibit "H".</p>

<p class="BODY">In said affidavit, Crispin Javier declares in subs­tance as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">One night, about the end of May 1960, Crispin was awakened by
Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> who asked him to accompany the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman was carrying a cane (<span class="SpellE">garote</span>) and had a hammer tucked in his waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left Roman's house and passed by the
house of one <span class="SpellE">Onyot</span> where <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> joined them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three of them proceeded towards the house of the old couple, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> <span class="SpellE">Puyod</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crispin was not told of their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived at the place, Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> went up the porch (<span class="SpellE">pantawan</span>),
climbed the make-shift window of woven coconut leaves and entered the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crispin was told to stay
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside, Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> lighted a lamp and placed it on the bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crispin Javier was down­stairs and peeping
through a crack in the walls, he saw Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>
hit several times with the cane the old man and old woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he opened the door and admitted <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span>, who was then at
the porch, to whom he handed the cane with which <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> immediately beat the old woman several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman drew from his waist the hammer and
hammered the old man on his face and head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Crispin did not count how many times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was very scared and was seized by an overwhelming fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After beating the couple, Roman and <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> carried the old man and laid him on the wooden
bench below the window, leaving the old woman where she lay beaten up.</p>

<p class="BODY">Afterwards, the two entered the room and Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugi­lon</span> hammered the trunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the lid was pried open, <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> withdrew from it bamboo tubes and poured the contents
- silver coins - on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman
went to the unconscious old woman and untied a cotton bag from her waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He transferred the lamp from the bench to the
floor and poured the contents of the cotton bag near the pile of silver coins
from the bamboo tubes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman and <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> started to count the money, the amount of which
Crispin did not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After counting the
money, they came down and Roman told him he will have a share but he refused to
receive any, and because he refused, Roman warned him not to tell anybody or
else they will kill him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked Roman
why he killed the old couple and Roman told him not to report because the
coconut plantation is already his.</p>

<p class="BODY">They parted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> and Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> went up the hill while he went down the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He slept under a certain house on an empty
sack and the following morning he took a boat to <span class="SpellE">Manla</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A week later Roman went to see him at <span class="SpellE">Manla</span>
and asked him if he told anyone of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his assurance that he did not, Roman
suggested that he go with the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fearful of his safety, he consented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Roman said it is well and good that he go along as he will help in the
harvesting of coconuts and the making of copra in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Amancio</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went with Roman and since then until <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="10">Sunday, October 28, 1962</st1:date>, he lived
in the house of Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> in <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Dala­ga</span> (Exhibit
"H").</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1962</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span>
and Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> were arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two were inves­tigated on the
robbery-killing aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> wrote down an
affidavit, dated <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1962</st1:date>,
Exhibit "I", stating that:</p>

<p class="BODY">He is a very close friend of Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion, Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>
told him "Let us kill the old couple because their nephews are giving me
trouble." He chose him as companion in the plot because they are
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they had agreed to kill
the old couple they walked towards the house where he lives and <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> went up and did not go down any more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day the old couple were dead
and Roman told him so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> shoul­dered all the burial expenses including the
tomb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man named Crispin <span class="SpellE">Moros</span> (Javier) went to live with Roman after the death of
the old couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman assigned him as
helper in making copra on their coconut land. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was because of this occasion that he
[Roman] was able to tell <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> that the old couple
were killed and that P800.00 were taken (Exhibit "I").</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And later, <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span>
signed an additional affidavit, also dated <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1962</st1:date>, Exhibit "1-4", in the office
of the Provincial Fiscal, stating, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> and Crispin Javier were
investigated on November 1, 1962 by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dalaga</span> and he [<span class="SpellE">Amancio</span>]
heard Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> declare that he was the one who
killed the two old couple, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emiliana</span> <span class="SpellE">Puyod</span> at <span class="SpellE">Sandayong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Casul</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalaga</span>,
on May 26, 1960; that Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> admitted before
the Chief of Police that he struck the head of the old couple with a piece of
wood; that he killed the spou­ses because the nephews of the old couple were
bothering him in the division or partition of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>coconut land; furthermore, Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> declared before the Chief of Police that he took
money from the house of the old couple after they were killed, amounting to
P800.00, contained in a tin can, bamboo tubes and in a small cotton bag and
consisting of silver coins and paper money; that Roman has taken a bigger bag
from the trunk, untied the cotton bag from the waist of the old woman and took
the bamboo tubes which were buried among the millet or cereal; that these
admissions of Roman were voluntary as he was not maltreated, forced or promised
anything; and that Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> confessed and made a
clean breast of it because Crispin Javier had made his statement and <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> had revealed what Roman had done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit "I-4)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of these aforementioned affidavits and other
evidence, Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> and Crispin Javier were prosecuted for the
robbery with double homicide committed against the aged spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the trial, the accused repudiated the
foregoing affidavits, asserting that the same were obtained thru force and intimidation,
and that the statements therein are not true but were provided by the Police
Chief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, Crispin Javier and <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> interposed
alibi, the former stating that at the time in question he was in <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, and
the latter, that he was in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, on <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="10">October
 7, 1965</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental rendered its decision, finding all three accused guilty as charged
upon the basis of their so-called extrajudicial confessions and proof of corpus
<span class="SpellE">delicti</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING and premises considered, pursuant to
the provisions of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code taken together with the
provisions of Article 64 paragraph 7 of the same code, sentences [sic] Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> and Crispin Javier to RECLUSION PERPETUA, to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased the sum of P12,000.00 jointly and
severally, to suffer the other accessory penalties provided for by law and to
pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appeal to this Court thereupon resulted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses no evidence advanced to prove the guilt of
any of the accused other than the so-called confessions of said accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Testimony was adduced - thru the witness <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> - to the effect that Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>, grand nephew of the deceased, had threatened to
kill them that afternoon of the day they were killed due to some misunderstanding
on the sharing of the crops of the land, as the old folks wanted Roman to give
a share to their grand niece <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>, but Roman allegedly was opposed to the idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, Roman had a deed of sale in his
favor over the land of the old folks, and the latter were only given the use
thereof until their death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
there is motive and basis to suspect Roman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, these are far from enough to convict him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This does not prove he had a hand in the
robbery-killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">For this, the prosecution and the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
relied on the so-called extrajudicial confessions of Crispin Javier and <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> (Exhibits
"H", "I" and "I-4").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These extrajudicial declarations, which were
repudiated at the trial, cannot be taken against Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span>,
for they are hearsay as to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming
they are confessions, a confession is admissible only against the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither can they be considered as declarations of co-conspirators; there was no
proof <span class="SpellE">aliunde</span> of the conspiracy and, above all, these
declarations were not made in the course of the execution of the offense but
long afterwards.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As far as Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> is concerned, they should
therefore be totally disregarded, for being hear­say.</p>

<p class="BODY">Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> himself did not admit
participation in the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
executed no affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon's</span> verbal statement during the investigation, as reported
by the Police Chief who investigated him, was mere­ly: "Please, Chief,
help me in this matter." (TSN, Nov. 12, 1964, p. 56) This is not a
positive and categorical admission of guilt of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could even be a plea of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly cannot be deemed a confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows only one witness who claims
that Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> categorically said he killed the
old couple: <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This witness allegedly was passing by near
the municipal building in the evening of November 1, 1962 when the
investigation was conducted and as an on-looker he heard Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> say: "Chief, help us, we were the ones who
killed the old folks." (TSN, June 4, 1964, p. 26) Said witness, however,
said on cross-examination that he was sixteen feet away from the Police Chief
who was then conducting the investiga­tion on the porch of the municipal
building (TSN, Ibid., pp. 41-42).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arocha's</span> version of what Roman said is therefore doubtful
and that of the Police Chief shows no con­fession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, finally, it is claimed that Roman <span class="SpellE">Jugilon</span> was showed the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> and after reading it he acknowledged the
same to be true but said he will first consult his lawyer (TSN, Nov. 12, 1964,
p. 59).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said affidavit referred to,
however, is the first one handwritten by <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span>, Exhibit "I" (TSN, Ibid., p. 22), and
not the second one, Exhibit "I-4"; the first affidavit merely said
that <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> and Roman had agreed to kill the old
folks; it does not state that they in fact did so; it was the second affidavit
which stated that Roman was heard by <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> to have
admitted during the police investigation that he, Roman, killed the old
folks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman's admission that the
contents of the first affidavit are true, therefore, does not amount to
admission on his part that he killed the old couple.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span>,
his two affidavits cannot be deemed a confession; there is nothing therein that
states that he took part in the robbery or killing in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Police Chief, in his testimony, said that
<span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> told Roman that he better confess that they
"were the ones." (TSN, Nov. 12, 1964, p. 55) Again, this does not
clearly show admission of his own guilt by him; he merely told Roman that it is
better for him to confess that they were the ones; Roman did not confess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot take this urging by <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> for Roman to confess that they were guilty, as a confession
by <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> that he was guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A confession must come from the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>, positive­ly admitting his own guilt to the
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to Crispin Javier, his affidavit is not only short of a
confession, but would clearly exculpate him; it says he was asked to come along
but he was not told of the evil purpose; that at the house of the old folks, he
was ordered to wait downstairs, and he did nothing to help the other accused as
they allegedly committed the robbery-killing upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, while his affidavit imputes the crime
on his co-accused, it would absolve himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated, the imputation against the others are inadmissible as
hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit not containing
any admission that the affiant took part in the robbery-killing, it is not a
confession and cannot be relied upon to convict the affiant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants, brief - it should also be mentioned - asserts, and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> brief does not deny, that in Criminal Case No.
6274, entitled People vs. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Limonsera</span>, et
al., for robbery, filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Occidental, the same Chief of Police who conducted the investigation herein,
extracted a confession from a suspect who later turned out upon further
investigation to have been confined at the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Penal Colony at the date of the robbery, prompting the provincial fiscal to
dismiss the case (Appellants' brief, p. 13).</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, therefore, in the present case, the con­viction,
predicated on so-called confessions, cannot be sustained, because there was in
fact no confession, the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> therein at most
merely imputing the guilt on the others, not on himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the record contains no other evidence
against the accused to show that they in fact robbed and killed the deceased,
their guilt cannot be deemed established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed,
and the three accused-appellants are acquitted, on reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<u>
