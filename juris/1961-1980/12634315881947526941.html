				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> Mama appealed from the decision of the
Court of First Instance of North <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, finding
them guilty of two separate crimes of murder, sentencing each of them to two <u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetuas</span></u>, and ordering them to pay P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Prowa</span> <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> and P12,000 to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Kadir</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oranen</span> (Criminal Case No. 5276).</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the prosecution, at about seven o'clock in the
evening of June 29, 1968, while <span class="SpellE">Prowa</span> <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> (<span class="SpellE">Palua</span> <span class="SpellE">Talip</span>),
a forty-year old farmer, was in the yard of his house located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Simsiman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pigcawayan</span>, North <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, handing a pot of rice to his wife, <span class="SpellE">Setie</span> <span class="SpellE">Mamalintao</span>, who was near
the stairs, he was felled down by a volley of shots.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Setie</span> rushed to the aid of her
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she looked in the direction
where the gunshots emanated, she saw <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> Mama
holding a gun near a coconut tree around six <span class="SpellE"><u>brazas</u></span>
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, she heard another volley of
shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> (<span class="SpellE">Poren</span>), also
holding a gun near another coconut <span class="GramE">tree</span> around ten
meters away in the yard of the house of her neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Daongan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Karaing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
noticed that <span class="SpellE">Kadir</span> <span class="SpellE">Oranen</span>,
who was nearby, had fallen to the ground around three arms' length from <span class="SpellE">Daongan's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kadir</span> died instantly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Setie</span> had known for a long time <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> who were
friends and neighbors also residing in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Simsiman</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Setie</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> had cultivated adjacent farmlands.</p>

<p class="BODY">While <span class="SpellE">Setie</span> was comforting her husband,
he allegedly told her that he was going to die.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He directed her to remember what had happened to him and that they had
seen <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> Mama and <span class="SpellE">Poren</span>
armed with guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to that shooting
incident, <span class="SpellE">Prowa</span> <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> had
reported to the barrio captain that <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> had stolen his lumber.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two assailants fled westward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time the incident occurred, <span class="SpellE">Japal</span> <span class="SpellE">Rongot</span> was on his way to <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He encountered <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> and Joseph <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> with
both of whom he was well acquainted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> why there were gunshots but the
latter did not make any reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
reaching <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> house, <span class="SpellE">Rongot</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Setie</span> crying and holding <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>
on her lap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Setie</span>
told him that <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> was shot by <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>
and she pointed to him <span class="SpellE">Oranen's</span> corpse which was
about two arms' length from <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ngelam</span> Towa (<span class="SpellE">Nilan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tuwa</span>), another neighbor and the uncle of <span class="SpellE">Setie</span>, heard the gunshots on the occasion in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hastened to <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Setie</span>
told him that <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> Mama had shot <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She advised
her uncle not to use his flashlight because <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>
was still in the vicinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Setie</span> also told Towa that <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> had shot <span class="SpellE">Oranen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Towa left <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span>
house in order to get assistance from his father-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While crossing the trail, his flashlight <span class="SpellE">focussed</span> on <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> with two companions leaving the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Policemen arrived at <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Setie</span>
informed them that <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> was the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
brought <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> to a medical clinic where he was
interrogated by Patrolman Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Sanada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Talib</span> told <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span> that his assailants were <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Florencio's</span> father, Joseph <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the critical condition of <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> (<span class="SpellE"><u>nagaagonto</u></span>), he was
not able to sign his dying declaration (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) <span class="GramE">as</span> taken down by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Talib</span> was brought
to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died on the
following day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that unsigned <span class="SpellE">antemortem</span>
declaration, <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> revealed that <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> suspected that he and <span class="SpellE">Oranen</span>
had masterminded the theft of Joseph <span class="SpellE">Odencio's</span> two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>, and that, on the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>
suspected <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> of having stolen the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> of <span class="SpellE">Damiog</span>, the father-in-law
of <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was stated further in the same dying declaration that <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> had told Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span>
that he wanted to sign it but that he could not do so because of the wound in
his arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Talib</span>
also articulated his belief that he was going to die because he could hardly
breathe and his wound was painful.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 1, 1968 or within forty-eight hours after taking <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> unsigned <span class="SpellE">antemortem</span>
statement, <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span> executed an affidavit reciting the
circumstances surrounding the taking thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Sañada</span> testified in court on <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> dying declaration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>
sustained eight gunshot wounds in the back or posterior chest wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No autopsy was performed on the body of <span class="SpellE">Oranen</span> who, as noted above, died at the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1968</st1:date>,
a complaint for double murder was filed in the municipal court against <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span>, Joseph <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Angelico</span> <span class="SpellE">Aposaga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poren's</span> father-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They waived the second stage of the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1968</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was filed in the
Court of First Instance against <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> and Joseph <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court acquitted Joseph and convicted only <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>, a thirty-two
year-old farmer, denied that he shot <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> and that
he had a misunderstanding with <span class="SpellE">Oranen</span> and <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> with both of whom he was acquainted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> testified
that he was in his house when the shooting occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was arrested on the following day, <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He surmised that he was implicated in the
case because he did not support Mayor <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span>, the
incumbent mayor, and, instead, he voted for <span class="SpellE">Estañol</span>,
the candidate of the Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencio's</span> alibi was corroborated by his wife and his
brother-in-law, Antonio Cesar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other accused, <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> Mama, a
thirty-year-old farmer, adopted the same line of defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that he was also in his house
when <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> was shot; that he had no misunderstanding
with <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>, who is his father's brother-in-law, being
the brother of his stepmother, his father's second wife; that he was arrested
while he was attending <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> funeral, and that he
came to know his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> only in jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused presented Samuel <span class="SpellE">Jubilan</span>, a
Constabulary sergeant, who testified that he was present when Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span> interrogated <span class="SpellE">Talib</span> and
that the latter declared that he was not able to recognize his assailant
because it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sañada</span>
said he did not know of that interrogation made by <span class="SpellE">Jubilan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In disbelieving the alibis of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>, the trial court observed that the
accused were indubitably identified as the assailants in <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span>
dying declarations to his wife and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Setie</span> <span class="SpellE">Mamalintao</span> in her statement to the police declared that she
was able to recognize <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> because there was a "big torch" in
front of her house and <span class="SpellE">Karaing's</span> house (No. 19, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1, p. 11, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court noted that there "was a good amount of
lighting in the yard of <span class="SpellE">Prowa</span> <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>
because he was preparing" supper when he was shot and that <span class="SpellE">Setie</span> was able to recognize the accused because she had
been acquainted with them for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated above, two witnesses saw the accused in the vicinity of <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> house shortly after the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the contention of appellants'
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> that they had not
been sufficiently identified as the killers cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
is that the trial court erred in finding that <span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> conspired to kill <span class="SpellE">Talib</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Oranen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That contention is belied by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guiamelon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Odencio</span> were seen pacing back and forth near <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> house on the day of the incident (No. 27, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They shot
the two victims in the same place and almost simultaneously, thus showing a
coordination of efforts and community of design.</p>

<p class="BODY">On leaving the scene of the crime, they proceeded in the same
direction (westward).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were animated
by the same motive, which was to liquidate the victims because the latter
allegedly stole the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> of the relatives of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not disclose
any reason why <span class="SpellE">Setie</span> <span class="SpellE">Mamalintao</span>
and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sañada</span> would frame up the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The manner in which they shot the victims shows treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shooting was not the product of momentary
impulse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span><u>
</u>because the two malefactors, taking advantage of the cover of night,
stationed themselves in a place where they could shoot the victims with
impunity without any risk to themselves or without exposing themselves to any
retaliation since the victims did not expect to be assaulted at that time and
place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' counsel further contends that they were convicted on
the basis of the wife's uncorroborated testimony "which is open to
suspicion due to inherent improbabilities" and "motives to falsify
the truth".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention is not
correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Talib's</span>
<span class="SpellE">antemortem</span> statement fortifies the testimony of his
widow, an eyewitness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have stressed
that two other witnesses saw the appellants leaving the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Talib's</span> dying declaration was
sufficiently proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is that a
dying declaration may be oral or written.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If oral, the witness, who heard it, may testify thereto without the necessity,
of course, of reproducing exactly the words of the decedent, if he is able to
give the substance thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An unsigned
dying declaration may be used as a memorandum by the witness who took it
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">(See 5 </span>Moran's Comments on the Rules
of Court, 1970 Ed., pp. 315-316.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied that the guilt of the appellants was proven
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they were
co-conspirators, they are each liable for the two murders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no modifying circumstances
concomitant with the commission of the two assassinations, the trial court
properly penalized each murder with <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
(Arts. 64[1] and 248, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's judgment is affirmed with the sole modification
that the two appellants should be held <span class="SpellE"><u>solidarily</u></span>
liable for the two indemnities of <span style="">P12<span class="GramE">,000</span> each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
service </span>of the two <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetuas</u></span>,
the forty-year limit fixed in article 70 of the Revised Penal Code should be
observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against the appellants.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
