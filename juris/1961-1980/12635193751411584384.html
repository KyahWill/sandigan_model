<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1970</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> issued two resolutions ordering the board
of canvassers to canvass the election returns in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
ordering the same board to desist from proclaiming the winning candidates until
further orders, and setting the petition for hearing in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to ascertain the truth of the allegation that no voting took place in the
disputed precincts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 24, 1970, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
petitioners, joined by another candidate, <span class="SpellE">Potri</span> Ali <span class="SpellE">Pacasum</span>, amended their petition, asking for the exclusion
of the election returns from the precincts of the barrios of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, Salvador, <span class="SpellE">Lala</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Kauswagan</span>, ex­cept those from precincts 16 and 24 of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span> and precincts 14 and 14-A of Salvador, and
repeating their allegation that no elections actually took place in the
questioned precincts,</p>

<blockquote>"and/or in the remote possibility that elections had been
initiated, they were suspended before the hour fixed by law for the closing of
the voting because of violence or terrorism and that the votes not cast therein
are sufficient to affect the results of the elec­tions,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and adding that the election returns from
the said precincts</p>

<blockquote>"... were prepared prior to the elections, and/ or had been
tampered with and/or are statis­tically improbable in that the number of voters
<span style="">who </span>allegedly cast their votes
is out of proportion to the actual population in those municipalities and muni­cipal
districts concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mariano <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>, Cornelio Sugano and <span class="SpellE">Mastura</span> <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> (herein­after
referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> respondents), candidates
affected by the petition, two of whom appeared as frontrunners per the initial
canvass of all the election returns from all the precincts of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, filed an amended answer dated November 26,
1970 wherein they vehemently denied the allegations of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
petitioners, brushing them off as "preposterous and without basis both in
fact and in law." Claiming that "free clean, peaceful and
orderly" elections took place in all the places and precincts enumerated
by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> petitioners, they asked for the
dismissal of the petition on the ground of lack of cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">At a preliminary conference between the parties, they assented to
the summoning by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> of the chairmen of <span style="">the </span>boards of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> to testify in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also agreed to allow the chairmen of the

subpoenaed the 42 chairmen of the boards of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="12">Decem­ber
 9, 1970</st1:date>, a number of them arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing, four chairmen testified, three of whom declared <span style="">that </span>the elections in their respective
precincts <span style="">were "free, </span>honest
and orderly." Of the three, however, one broke down on cross-examination
and revealed what really transpired in his precinct on election day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He related that only about 10% <span style="">to 20% </span>of the registered voters in his
precinct actually voted and that armed men prepared and filled up the rest of
the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, he stated that
<span style="">t</span>wo unidentified men gave him a
piece of paper with the names of five candidates <span style="">writ­ten thereon with </span>the corresponding number of <span style="">votes "they were sup­posed </span>to
receive in the <span style="">precinct." The
unidentified men </span>told <span style="">him to
give </span>the indicated number of <span style="">votes
to the persons </span>listed the piece of paper; so the board prepared the <span style="">election returns in accordance </span>with their
instructions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fourth chairman </span>who
testified <span style="">revealed that on the day </span>before
the elections, the members <span style="">of the
boards of inspectors, having been summoned, </span>appeared at the office <span style="">of the mayor where they were </span>questioned
on their <span style="">"willingness to cooperate"
by </span>making some candidates win in <span style="">their
respective precincts.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She further
testified </span>that on <span style="">election day,
about twenty </span>Muslims <span style="">appeared in
her precinct who prepared and filled up the ballots and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>
</span>and <span style="">signed the voting record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, upon the application </span>of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> petitioners, ordered the production in Manila of
the pre­cinct books of voters for <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
including CE forms 39 (lists of voters who <span style="">voted) used in connection with the 1970 elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 12, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, by resolution, directed the chief of its
Fingerprint Identification Division, Jose <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>, to
examine all the </span>precinct books of voters for <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
together <span style="">with the </span>CE forms 39
accomplished in connection with the 1970 elections, to determine:</p>

affixed on the 1970 voting record of each voter on Form No. 1 coincides with
the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> of the voters on the face of said Form
No. 1 and also in the 1970 Form No. 39;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How many are there where the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on Form 1, the voting record and Form 39 are by
the same persons indicating that the registered voter had cast his vote in the
precinct?</blockquote>

on Form 1, the voting record and Form 39 are by more than one person?</blockquote>

in Form 39 which appear more than once, indicating that one person affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> more than once?</blockquote>

appearing in more than one voting record also indicating that one person
affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> in two or more voting records
in Form 1?",</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and in the case of blurred <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> or <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> not
capable of being used as bases for identification, to examine the signatures in
CE form 1, the voting record, and CE form 39 instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> ordered
<span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> to submit his report thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same resolution, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
ordered the suspension of the examination of the other chairmen of the boards

thereafter submitted two reports dated <st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="12">December

experts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1971</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>
submitted the revised report which introduced no changes with regard to the
find­ings made in the previous reports.</p>

<p class="BODY">The revised report stated that the Fingerprint Identification
Division of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in six teams of three
members each, examined, analyzed and made a comparison of the registered
voter's right hand <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> appearing on the voter's
registration record (front side of CE form 1) with that appearing on the voting
record (back side of CE form 1) and/or on the list of voters who voted (CE form
39), to determine whether or not the registered voter actually voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The revised report also stated that the
examiners made no analysis in those instances wherein a person appears to have
voted as his name appears on CE form 39 but has no CE form 1, or wherein a
voter failed to place his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on CE form 39 and
on the back side of CE form 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY">On March 12, 1971 the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> issued
Resolution RR-892 wherein, among others, it (1) declared, by unanimous vote,
the returns from the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> as
"spurious and/or manufactured;" (2) or­dered, by unanimous vote, the
exclusion from the canvass for the elec­tion of delegates for <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte the aforesaid returns; and (3) by unanimous
vote, held as unnecessary any further hearing on the petition relating to the
disputed returns from <span class="SpellE">Pantao-Ragat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Matungao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Munai</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tangcal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nunungan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, and
Salvador, "it appear­ing that the results of the election would no longer
be affected by ques­tioned returns from said municipalities after the rejection
of the returns from the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,"
and directed the board of canvasser to include the returns from the said
municipalities' in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> found that</p>

<blockquote>"in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
there were 9,419 registered voters; and that 9,557 had actually voted, or that
138 votes were in excess of the number of registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of these 9,557 who voted, only 239 had been
established to have actually voted among the registered voters in all the 42
precincts; that 6,147 of the registered voters had been voted for by substitute
voters, while an additional 673 persons who were not registered in any of the
42 precincts were able to vote without using the name of any of the registered
voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2,498 of those who voted could
not be determined whe­ther they were registered voters or persons who voted in
substitution of the registered voters."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Continuing, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
observed that</p>

<blockquote>"(I)n all the 42 precincts, many of the registered voters have
been voted for by persons other than the registered voters; in several
precincts, several groups of thumbprints and signatures were made by one
person; in majority cases, none or only one each thumbprint or signature
appears to belong to a registered voter in the precinct but those identified as
registered voters who voted in the precincts were probably those who were able
to vote before the substitute voters had voted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A very high percentage of voting could be noted in these 42 precincts,
there having been 100% voting in 10 pre­cincts, and with more than 100% in 7
precincts where there is an excess of votes over the registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also an excess of votes in the
whole town by 138 votes over the number of registered voters."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the testimony of the chairmen of the boards of inspectors
relating to the "free, honest, and orderly" elections in their res­pective
precincts and the joint affidavits of the members of the afore­said boards
attesting to the orderliness and peacefulness of the elections in the precincts
wherein they served, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> stated that the
findings of its Fingerprint Identification Division and of the NBI handwriting
experts conclusively belie the statements of the afore­mentioned members of the
boards of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reject­ing the veracity of their statements,
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> opined that the members of the boards of
inspectors were</p>

<blockquote>"co-conspirators or hostages of the perpetrators of a deeply
rooted practice spawned by the political <span class="SpellE">caciquism</span> of
<span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, unwilling to tell the truth either because
they would thereby be admitting their guilty participation or exposing
themselves and their families to reprisals."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In rejecting the election
returns from the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karo­matan</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"An election return is a report prepared and cer­tified as
true and correct by the members of the board of election inspectors of the
election in their respective precincts, showing how the votes had been read,
counted and tallied by the board and the number of votes received by
candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But an election return
presupposes that there is a bona fide, not a sham election, conducted in the
precinct where only the registered voters had voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if the election is sham, how can the
board of ins­pectors make a report on the presumptive result of the election in
their respective precincts?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can said
returns be accorded any prima facie value?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What the board of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
should have done was to certify that there was no voting in their precinct
since the registered voters did not vote but some­body else voted in their
names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When instead of doing this they
prepared the returns and certified to a falsehood, the returns prepared by them
must be considered spurious, false or manufactured returns and in fact is no
return at all."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the question of
whether or not to hold a special election in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
two members of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> voted down the calling of
such a special election and directed the completion of the canvass on the basis
of the valid returns from the rest of the precincts of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del Norte, and the proclamation, upon authority of <u>Antonio, Jr. vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, et al.</u> (32 SCRA 319), of the third winning
candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
member held the view that the finding by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
that the registered voters in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
had not voted amounts to a finding of failure of election in the said 42 pre­cincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opined that pursuant to section 17 </span>(e)
<span style="">of Republic Act 6132, the situation
necessarily called for the holding of a special election in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>,

signatures and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> of the voters who voted in
the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Usman</span> prayed for

March 25, 1971; (2) the setting aside of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution dated March 12, 1971 and the inclusion of the results from the 42
pre­cincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> in the canvass of the

this Court sustains the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution

Forms 39 submitted to them to the effect that out <span style="">of </span>the total of 9,557 votes cast in the said 42 precincts in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, only 239 had been established to have been cast
by duly regis­tered voters, 673 had been cast by non-registered persons, 6,147
had been cast by substitute voters and 2,498 had been cast by persons whose
thumbprints and signatures are not definitely identifiable; (b) the qualifi­cations
of almost all of sad experts were not duly dis­closed, much less proven during
the hearing, thus dep­riving the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of his request, of the opportunity to properly scrutinize them; and (c) only
the chief of said experts, Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span>, who had
not personally examined and studied all the thumbprints and signatures in
question, was called to testify, albeit aided by his assistants, and his
testimony on cross-examination appears to have been unduly limited by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>; not to mention the fact that the several re­ports
of the experts of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, and of the National
Bureau of Investigation, who, with the exception of only Eduardo V. <span class="SpellE">Maniwang</span>, were not called to testify, are not clearly
consistent with each other."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> resolution,

qualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Usman</span>
also informed the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> of his intention to present

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1971</st1:date>

arrival of the affidavits that morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, to give the counsel for <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> ample time to sort out the affidavits for an orderly
presenta­tion, re-scheduled the case for hearing the following <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="8">Monday, August 16, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came Monday morning and the counsel for <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>
failed to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he sent his
secretary to deliver the affidavits, together with a motion for postponement
and a petition asking for more time within which to gather additional
affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Usman's</span>
counsel, in asking for postponement, alleged as cause his appearance before the
Criminal Circuit Court in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City in connection
with the hearing of the crim­inal case against Vincent <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, before
acting on the motion for postponement, called the secretary to the witness
stand to find out the reason for the non-appearance of <span class="SpellE">Usman's</span>
counsel des­pite the fact that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had reset
the case to <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1971</st1:date>
with the counsel's prior knowledge and for his convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> found
out that <span class="SpellE">Usman's</span> counsel gave his secretary
instructions to bring the affidavits to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
only the preceding night and that two other lawyers, belonging to the said
counsel's law office, were also handling the <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
case in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> denied the motion for
postponement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the affidavits, the counsel for <span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span>
objected to their admission in evidence on the ground of non-compliance with
the conditions laid down by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> sustained
the objec­tion of <span class="SpellE">Quibranza's</span> counsel and denied the
admission of the affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> ordered the inclusion
of the affidavits as part of the records of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Quibranza's</span> counsel
not having any rebuttal evidence to present, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
considered the case sub­mitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in its resolution of <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1971</st1:date>, found no basis to
reconsider its findings based on the reports of the finger­print and
handwriting experts, and resolved to confirm its previous ruling declaring the
returns from the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> as
"spurious and manufactured" returns and ordering their exclusion from
the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the question of whether
or not to call a special election, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
chairman maintained his original view relating to the completion of the canvass
on the basis of the valid returns from the rest of the precincts of the lone
district of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte and the proclamation of
the third winning candidate on the basis of the said canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other member maintained his original view
on the need of holding a special election in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
because of the retirement of the third commissioner, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
found itself in a deadlock on the issue of whether to call a special elec­tion in
<span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> or to proclaim the third winning candidate
on the basis of the canvass of all the valid returns from the remaining pre­cincts
of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the voluminous record of the case at bar,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the mass of accumulated facts graphically narrated by the parties, and the
various arguments advanced, the issue tendered for resolution, as we see it,
relates fundamentally to the authority of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to declare the election returns from the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
as "spurious and/or manufactured" and to exclude them from the
canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Usman's</span> main argument hinges entirely
on what he views as the well-circumscribed jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in pre-procla­mation controversies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
in such pro­ceedings - summary in nature and character - has jurisdiction only
to determine questions relating to the qualification of the members of the
board of canvassers, the completeness or incompleteness of a canvass, and the
integrity and authenticity of election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, in its inquiry, <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> states, should concern itself only with the integrity
and authenticity of the election returns, and not their veracity - that is,
whether the said returns are genuine, whether they are forged and spurious,
whether they were signed by the proper officers, and whether they were signed
under duress and/or intimidation by the election inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should
decide the question of the integrity and authenticity of the election returns
solely on the basis of the face of the said returns since it has no legal
authority to receive evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> in that
regard.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Usman</span> further alleges that the
questions of the validity of the ballots cast in support of the election
returns and the regularity of the voting, have no relevance whatsoever to the
integrity and authenticity of the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to reject and set aside the said
election returns on the ground of the invalidity of the ballots cast in support
thereof pertains solely to the Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> points out, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has
no authority at </span>all to receive evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>
to determine the regularity or irregularity of the voting in the 42 precincts
of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> or to ascertain the genuine­ness or
falsity of the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> and signatures of the
registered voters who voted, for the purpose of deciding the question of the
integrity and authenticity of the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Usman</span> attributes
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> lack of jurisdiction to two factors -
the first, the summary nature and character of a pre-proclamation controversy
which requires the termina­tion of the proceedings with the least possible
delay; the second, the limited composition and restricted organization of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> which render it incapable of exercising the
authority questioned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span>, for his part, argues that
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has authority to admit evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> in a controversy arising in the course of
canvass proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, he states,
regarding election returns objected to on the ground of defects patent on the
face of the said returns - like tampered returns or returns with erasures and
alterations - the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has no jurisdiction to go
beyond the face of the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, regarding election returns objected to on some grounds not
discernible from the face of the said returns - like coerced, gunpoint,
spurious or manufactured returns - the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has
authority to admit evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> to rebut
the value of the returns as <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of the count of
votes in the precincts involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, <span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span> asserts, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has jurisdiction to receive evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> that would show that "registered voters
did not in fact vote, but that other persons voted for them." In such an
event where a great majority of substitutes voted in lieu of those duly
registered as voters, the election returns drawn up on the basis of the votes
cast by the substitute voters should be considered as spurious returns and
should consequently not be accorded <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, there could be no genuine and
regular returns certifying to the results of an election that did not, in law,
take place.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span> finally avers that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> acted within its authority when it ordered - for
the purpose of determining whe­ther or not validly registered voters actually
voted in the precincts in dispute - the examination and analysis of the
standard <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> and signatures appearing on the
voters' registration records and their comparison with those found on the
voting records and/or list of voters who voted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In doing so, he adds, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> concerned
itself only with the conduct of the elections in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
in consonance with its constitutional duty to enforce and administer "all
laws relative to the conduct of elections" and to insure "free,
orderly, and honest elections."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the case at bar directly confronts this Court with a
problem fraught, not with fancied serious effects, but with possible
far-reaching consequences attendant to the flood of pre-proclamation
controversies that could be brought before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mindful of the vital role of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> of insuring free, orderly and honest elections
pursuant to the mandates of the Constitution and the Election Code, on the one
hand, and of the diverse - and oftentimes, novel - anomalous devices and
schemes aimed at subverting the popular will ingeniously conceived and <span class="SpellE">practised</span> by unscrupulous politicians and their followers,
on the Other hand, we approach and view the problem with utmost concern and
circumspection.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>broad</u> power of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
conferred upon it by the Constitution, to enforce and administer "all laws
relative to the conduct of elections" and to decide all administrative
questions affecting elections "for the purpose of insuring free, orderly
and honest elections," has been the key in the resolution of many
pre-proclamation contro­versies involving the integrity and authenticity of
election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Invoking the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> power of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
we justified the action and upheld the authority of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to order the exclusion of "ob­viously manufactured" returns,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
or tampered returns,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
or returns prepared under threats and coercion or under circumstances affecting
the returns' integrity and authenticity,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
emphasizing the duty of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to see to the use
and inclusion in the canvass of only genuine and regular election returns for
determining the true result of the elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several circumstances, defying exact description and dependent
mainly on the factual milieu of the particular controversy, have the effect of
destroying the integrity and authenticity of disputed election returns and of
avoiding their <u>prima facie</u> value and character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If satis­factorily proven, although in a
summary proceeding, such circumstances as alleged by the affected or interested
parties, stamp the election re­turns with the indelible mark of falsity and
irregularity, and, conse­quently, of unreliability, and justify their exclusion
from the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">Remarkably, <span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span>, in the petitions
he filed (together with <span class="SpellE">Abalos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bosico</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pacasum</span>) with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
alleged that no actual voting took place in the precincts in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Determined to pursue its quest for the truth,
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> summoned the 42 chairmen of the boards of
inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> to testify in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because only a number of the chairmen
arrived to give their versions of what supposedly happened in their respective
precincts, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> deemed it proper to resort to
the more con­vincing mode of discovery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It thus ordered the production in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
of the precinct books of voters and CE forms 39 of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it directed the chief of its Fingerprint
Identification Division to con­duct examination, comparison and analysis of the
fingerprints appear­ing on the voters' registration records and on the voting
records and/or lists of voters who voted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With regard to those voters with blurred, smudged or faint fingerprints,
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> referred their records to the Questioned
Documents experts of the NBI for examination and analysis of their signatures.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the performance of its duty to guard against the use and
inclusion of returns prepared under circumstances showing their falsity in the
canvass of election results, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should not
be hampered in the choice of effective means and methods to fully ascertain the
genuineness and regularity of disputed election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish the indubitable existence of any
of such circumstances - necessarily not evident from an examination of the
election returns themselves - demands recourse to proof independent of the
election returns or to evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, we find it necessary to mention that the
results of the examination and analysis of the voters' fingerprints and
signatures indicating that many of the registered voters have been voted for by
per­sons not even registered in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
constituted not the sole factor which prompted the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to declare the 42 elec­tion returns as "spurious and/ or
manufactured." <span style="">A </span>totality
of circumstances - not merely of persuasive but of compelling character - led
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to consider and conclude that the
aforesaid election returns are "spurious and/or manufactured" and
therefore unworthy of inclusion in the canvass of the election results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> heavily
relied on the following noteworthy circumstances:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very high percentage
of voting in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> - with
100% voting in 10 precincts, and with more than 100% voting in 7 precincts
where the number of votes exceeded the number of registered voters - in the
whole town of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, there appeared an excess of
138 votes over the number of registered voters;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day before the
elections, the members of the boards of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
were summoned to the office of the mayor where they were "asked" to
"cooperate" by making some candidates win in their respective
precincts;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members of the boards
of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, either out of fear due to
terrorism or in connivance with those responsible for the election anomalies,
allowed voting by persons other than those registered as voters in their
respective precincts;</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
irregularities<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- among them, multiple
registra­tion, blurred fingerprints making identification impossible, and ID
pictures attached to CE forms 1 showing the registered voters as minors - appearing
in the precinct books of voters of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> making
possible the perpetration of the election anomalies; and</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notorious election
record of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> in previous elections since 1953
indicating a phenomenal increase in the voting population.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">We fully agree with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that
the totality of all the foregoing circumstances, taken together with the
findings of the Fingerprint Identification Division of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
and of the Questioned Documents experts of the NBI, more than suffices to
completely overcome the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value of the 42 election
returns from <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, strongly belying their
integrity and authenticity.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
These circumstances defi­nitely point, not merely to a few isolated instances
of irregularities affecting the integrity and authenticity of the election
returns, but to an organized, well-directed large-scale operation to make a
mockery of the elections in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find and so hold that the election returns
from the 42 precincts in question were prepared under cir­cumstances
conclusively showing that they are false, and are so devoid of value as to be
completely unworthy of inclusion in the can­vass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no alternative but to affirm the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> finding that they are spurious and manufactured.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question that remains relates to <span class="SpellE">Usman's</span>
plea for the holding of a special election in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With section 17 (e) of Republic Act 6132 in
mind, <span class="SpellE">Usman</span> considers it mandatory on the part of the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to call for a special election in the
precincts concerned if it found that</p>

<blockquote>"no voting has been held or that voting has been suspended
before the hour fixed by law for the closing of the voting in any precinct or
precincts because of <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>,
violence or terrorism, and the votes not cast therein are sufficient to affect
the results of the election."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span> counters that the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> provision of law leaves to the discretion of
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the calling of a special election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, he submits that the said
provision finds no application in the case at bar because of the
non-fulfillment of one of the conditions laid down by section 17 (e), which
condition is that the "votes not cast therein are sufficient to affect the
results of the election." <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>, according to <span class="SpellE">Quibranza</span>, adduced no evidence whatsoever to show that the
"votes not cast" in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> would alter
the results of the elec­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving this question, as previously stated, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> commissioners, per the resolution dated <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1971</st1:date>, failed to reach a
consensus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One commissioner believed
that the canvass should be completed on the basis of the valid returns from,
the other precincts of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte and that the
proclamation of the third winning candidate on the basis of the said canvass
should logically follow; the other commissioner maintained his original view
that there is need of a special election in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>reading of
section 17 (e) of Republic Act 6132 makes it apparent that Congress has
delegated to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the power to call for a
special election - a power essentially legislative in nature, being merely an
incident to or an extension or modality of the power to fix the date of the
elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
However, in the proper exercise of the delegated power, Congress saw fit to
require the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to ascertain that (1) no voting
has been held in any precinct or precincts because of <u><span style="">force</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>, violence or
terrorism, <u>and</u> (2) that the votes not cast therein suffice, to affect
the results of the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
language of the provision clearly requires the concurrence of the two
circumstances to justify the calling of a special election.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> concedes that what
transpired in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> constitutes "not merely
a simple case of irregularity in the voting but a case of no voting or no
election at all." However, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
attributes this to "massive fraud" rather than to <u><span style="">force</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>, </span>violence or terrorism
- the three causes explicitly enumerated by section 17 (e).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike section 17 (d) which empowers the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to postpone the election in any political division
or subdivision whenever it finds that the holding of a free, orderly and honest
election therein is rendered impossible by reason of fraud, violence, coercion,
terrorism, or any other serious cause or causes, section 17 (e) excludes the
situa­tion where no voting has been held because of <u><span style="">fraud</span></u><span style="">. </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, doubt exists whether or not the
irregularities committed in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> properly
partake of violence <span style="">or </span>terrorism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, we find that the first
circumstance is not attendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second circumstance, therefore, we find it unnecessary
to indulge in surmises.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

A phase of the controversy at bar, although not constituting a determinant
factor, deserves passing mention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
intervening period of about seven months from <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1970</st1:date> (the day of the elec­tion of delegates
to the Constitutional Convention) to <st1:date year="1971" day="1" month="6">June
 1, 1971</st1:date> (the day of the inaugural opening of the Convention itself)
provided the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> with sufficient time to fully
inquire into the irregularities committed with connection with the conduct of
the said elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This available time,
in addition to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> "fact-finding
facilities, its contact with political strategists, and its knowledge derived
from actual experience in dealing with political controversies" (<span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span> <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 73
Phil. 288), enabled it to make a meticulous and extensive study of the
existence, nature and causes of the irregu­larities which attended the
elections.</p>
