				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition to review and reverse the
decision of the Court of Appeals, in its Case CA-GR No. 28241-R, that
affirmed the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila,
requiring petitioner herein, Te Atta Vda. de Calderon, to vacate
certain premises in Nueva Street , Manila , and remove her improvements
thereon within three months from notice of the decision, restoring
possession to the Manila Remnant Co., Inc., plus costs.
<p align="justify">The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are not
in dispute. Petitioner-appellant Te Atta was the lessee of a parcel of
land in Binondo, Manila, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No.
15515, upon which she had erected a building designated as Nos. 471-75,
Nueva Street. The lease had not been recorded. Upon purchasing the lot
from its former owners, the Grey family, in April, 1957, the
respondent-appellee Manila Remnant Co., Inc., demanded of the lessee
that she vacate the land within 90 days from notice, but she objected.
Negotiations ultimately resulted in a written agreement, on October,
1957, substantially stipulating as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">"WHEREAS, the LESSOR is the absolute
owner of the land located at 461-74 Nueva Street, Manila, more
particularly described under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15515,
of the Registry of Deeds of Manila, and the LESSEE is the absolute
owner of a house of strong materials on the said land.</p>
  <p align="justify">WHEREAS,
the parties have mutually agreed as they hereby agree to authorize A.
U. Valencia &amp; Co., authority to sell the property hereinabove
described for the amount to Three Hundred Seventy Thousand Pesos
(P370,000.00), to be apportioned as follows: P310,000.00 to be paid to
the LESSOR and P60,000.00 clean to be paid on the LESSEE, representing
the value of the land and improvements respectively, provided however,
in the event that the property may be sold at a higher price, the
proportionate ratio six to one on the over price will be divided
between the parties.</p>
  <p align="justify">WHEREAS, the parties
have mutually agreed as they hereby agree that until and after property
mentioned above shall have been actually sold and the price thereof
paid, the LESSEE shall pay the LESSOR by way of rentals the sum of
P1,750.00 a month; and</p>
  <p align="justify">WHEREAS, the LESSEE
tenders and the LESSOR accepts the full payment of P10,000.00,
P9,000.00 in cash and P1,000.00 promissory note payable from the
proceeds of the purchase price of the building, representing the rental
in arrears, including the month of October, 1957."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">About three months afterward, broker Valencia wrote
resigning the commission given him to sell the tenement due to
allegedly unreasonable price fixed for the improvements. One month
later, on February 24, 1958, the landowner (respondent-appellee)
notified the lessee and required her to vacate the property and remove
the improvements within 60 days. Appellant answered that the demand was
premature, and violated their contract. As a result,
respondent-appellee filed action for illegal detainer in the Municipal
Court of Manila, but that court sustained the lessee and dismissed the
action. On appeal to the Court of First Instance, the decision was
reversed, the lessee ordered to restore possession, as heretofore
noted. That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p align="justify">In this Supreme Court, appellant insists that the
1957 contract gave her the right to remain in possession at a monthly
rental of P1,750.00 until the property was sold, and that the sale was
a condition precedent for the recovery of possession by the lessor.</p>
<p align="justify">We find this appeal untenable. Construing the
agreement in its entirety, it is apparent that the stipulation therein
(third "whereas") -</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">"that until and after (the) property
mentioned above shall have been actually sold and the price thereof
paid, the LESSEE shall pay the LESSOR by way of rentals the sum of
P1,750.00 a month"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">could only refer to the power to sell given to A. U.
Valencia &amp; Co. in the paragraph immediately preceding. Assuming
that the quoted clause entitled the appellant to remain in possession,
it did so only with an <span style="font-style: italic;">ad</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">interim</span> character until the
agent appointed was able to make the sale, for the price stated, or it
became clear that the property could not be sold. Since Valencia
resigned his commission and manifested his inability to sell the
property on the terms specified, the 1957 contract became thereafter <span style="font-style: italic;">functus</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">officio</span><span style="font-style: italic;">
</span>and its binding force terminated, its objective having become
impossible of attainment for all intents and purposes. To make another
sale would require a new agreement and a new price. But none was ever
agreed upon or contemplated.</p>
<p align="justify">The consequence of the purported sale becoming
impossible is that the situation of the parties reverted to what it was
before the 1957 agreement: that is to say, that the respondent
corporation became entitled to terminate the lease of petitioner Te
Atta Uy Vda. de Calderon, since her lease was without a definite
period, and hence, was on a month to month basis because the rental was
monthly (Art. 1687, Civil Code). While that article also empowers the
court to fix a longer term if the lessee, on a monthly basis, has been
in occupation for more than a year, the Court of First Instance already
had exercised that power when it gave the herein petitioner-appellant,
as lessee, three months to vacate (Decision, Rec. App., p. 52). That
period has already elapsed with considerable excess, and there is no
warrant for extending it further.</p>
<p align="justify">The decision of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, affirmed. Petitioner to pay the costs in all instances.</p>
