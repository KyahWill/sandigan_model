				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Comigjod</span>
from a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
convicting him of the crime of murder, with which he is charged, and sentencing
him to life imprisonment, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Pastor <span class="SpellE">Ladesa</span>,
in the sum <span style="">of </span>P4<span class="GramE">,000</span>, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency,
as well as to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that on July 28, 1960, at about 7:30 p.m., the
body of Pastor <span class="SpellE">Ladesa</span> was found <span style="">in </span>a coffee
grove, about 200 to 300 meters from his house, in <span class="SpellE">Balaban</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>, municipality of <span style="">Sta. </span>Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, with several incise
wounds on the head, which must have caused his death at about 2:00 p.m., due to
cerebral concussion and cerebral hemorrhage, as well as internal and external
hemorrhage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question for <span style="">determination in </span>this <span style="">case </span>is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>who killed him? Appellant <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Comigjod</span> <span style="">is </span>married to Juliana <span class="SpellE">Calungsod</span>,
daughter of Ana <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter is, in turn, <span class="SpellE">Ladesa's</span>
common-law wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the witnesses
herein refer <span style="">to </span><span class="SpellE">Ladesa</span> <span style="">as </span>appellant's father-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Early in the morning, <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="7">July
 29, 1960</st1:date>, Juliana informed vice-barrio lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Andres, that <span class="SpellE">Ladesa's</span>
killer <span style="">is </span>her husband, appellant
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, that <span style="">same </span>morning,
Andres transmitted the information to Policemen Frank <span class="SpellE">Bumpus</span>
and Modesto <span class="SpellE">Alama</span>, who had come to investigate the
occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the policemen
pro­ceeded to the scene of the occurrence, where appellant was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bumpus</span> asked him
whether it was he who killed <span class="SpellE">Ladesa</span>, but, appellant
did not reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When policeman <span class="SpellE">Alama</span> confronted him with the report given by his wife to
Andres, appellant admitted being the killer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Queried about the instrument used to commit the offense, <span class="SpellE">Comigjod</span> answered that it was a bolo he had in his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, the policemen ac­companied
him thereto, where <span class="SpellE">Comigjod</span> turned over to them the
bolo Exhibit D, which was still stained with blood.</p>

<p class="BODY">Brought to the police station, appellant was further investigated
by <span class="SpellE">Bumpus</span>, to whom the former confessed that he had
killed <span class="SpellE">Ladesa</span> because he had been too harsh at
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Bumpus</span>
typewrote the statement Exhibit E, which appellant <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>
and swore to, on July 30, 1960, be­fore the Justice of the Peace of Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant testified that, on July 28, 1960, he was with his wife
in the house of the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Andres,
from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.; that when the policemen asked him, at the scene
of the occurrence, why he had killed <span class="SpellE">Lade­sa</span>, he
(appellant) denied having done so; that the bolo Ex­hibit D was taken from his
house by the policemen, not de­livered by him to them; that he <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> the statement Exhibit E without knowing <span style="">its </span>contents,
because the police­men assured him that, after affixing his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
thereon, they would release him; and that, instead, however, they took him back
to his cell, where, later in the evening, they boxed him on the stomach and
kicked him on the forehead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the policemen denied having used the alleged
duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the same was obviously
unnecessary because it was resorted to, according to appellant, <u>after</u> <span style="">he </span>had <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>
the statement Exhibit E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
justice of the peace affirmed positively that he <span style="">had caused the </span>contents of the statement <span style="">to </span>be translated, in his pre<span style="">sence, to ap</span>pellant herein, <span style="">into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect; that he checked
whether the translation was accurate or not; </span>that he (<span class="SpellE">Cometa</span>) even inquired from appellant whether the
translation into English contained in the statement was, likewise, accurate;
and that appellant answered in <span style="">the </span>affirm­ative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, nobody ever saw any external sign of
appel­<span style="">lant's
alleged maltreatment, or </span>was even informed by him about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems only too <span style="">obvious </span>that appellant's <span style="">tes­</span>timony
cannot prevail over that of the justice of the peace.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, appellant's <u><span style="">alibi</span></u><span style=""> </span>was
contradicted by <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Andres, who declared that
appellant went to his (Andres') house at 4:00 p.m., and was <span class="GramE">not,</span>
accordingly, there at 2:00 p.m., when the crime charged was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, appellant did not introduce the
testimony of his wife, who according to the theory of the defense, was with him
when they allegedly went to said house at 11:00 a.m. and stayed there
continuously up to 4:00 pm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
reason seems obvious for, had she testified for the defense, she would have
been cross-examined on the <span style="">fact </span>that
it was she who <span style="">revealed to </span>Andres,
early in the morning of July 29, 1960, that the mur­derer <span style="">was </span>her <span style="">husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This was
impliedly confirmed by ap­pellant himself, he having admitted, on the witness
stand, that, while at the scene of the occurrence, the policemen asked him why
he had killed <span class="SpellE">Ladesa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It will be recalled, in this connection that, before proceeding to said
place, the peace officers had passed by the house of Andres, who conveyed to
them the information given to him by appellant's wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are fully <span class="GramE">satisfied,</span> therefore, that
appellant has committed the act charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nature and location of the injuries found in <span class="SpellE">Ladesa's</span>
body indicate that he was attack­ed from behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This and other circumstances set forth in
appellant's confession sufficiently establish the fact that appellant had acted
with treachery, and that the offense com­mitted <span style="">is, </span>murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No modifying circumstance having attended the
perpetration of the crime, the penalty prescribed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
should be imposed in its medium period, which is that meted out in the decision
appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against
appellant <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Comigjod</span>.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Castro, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>
