<p class="BODY">In the decision dated <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1968</st1:date> of then acting commis­sion chairman <span class="SpellE">Cesareo</span>
Perez, the award dated <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="11">November 9,
 1967</st1:date> issued by the workmen's compensation section chief of the
commission's <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> <span class="SpellE">subregional</span>
office for respondent claimant <span class="SpellE">Taay's</span> total temporary
<span style="">disability due to moderately advanced
pulmonary tuberculosis (incurred after eight years employment as operator with
petitioner) was affirmed with modification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was thereby ordered:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay the claimant in lump sum through this
Commission the amount of ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY and 35/100 PESOS
(P1,330.35) as compensation; and commencing February 15, 1968, to pay the
claimant a weekly compensation of P27.15 until <span style="">his illness is declared by competent authority to have been cured or
arrested, but not to exceed the amount of P6,000.00 in the aggregate;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay the claimant the sum of ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEEN and 65/100 PESOS (P114.65) as reimburse­ment of medical expenses, and
to provide him with such services, appliances, and supplies as the nature of
his dis­ability and the process of his recovery may require, and that which
would promote his early restoration to the maximum level of his physical
capacity; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay the Workmen's Compensation Fund the sum
of NINETEEN PESOS (P14.00 as decision fee and P5.00 as cost of this review)
pursuant to Sec. 55 of the Act, as amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied "for lack
of merit" by the commission <u>en banc</u> in its resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's appeal was given due course per the Court's resolu­tion
of August 27, 1968 on petitioner's seemingly plausible submittal that its
substantial rights had been violated in that the commission allegedly arbi­trarily
held its statement of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> to be a <u>pro</u>
<u>forma</u> statement of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> that was
fatally deficient in form and substance, notwithstand­ing that its failure to
state its reasons for <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> was due to the
lack of a corresponding question thereon in WC Form No. 3, supplied by the com­mission
itself, and that it had therefore been denied its right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal was submitted for decision without respondent having
filed a brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The commission records, however, fully support and justify in law
the decision appealed from.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case background is thus briefly recounted in the
decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"(I)t appears that the
award in question was issued based upon the records and without a hearing on
the merits for failure of the respondent to contro­vert the right to
compensation of the claimant in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In now seeking to set aside the award and to
have the case heard on the merits, the respondent in effect contends that it
had timely exercised its right of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> and
therefore, it is entitled to a hearing where it could pre­sent 'a valid and
good defense showing its non-liability to the claim…' In essence, it is the
position of the respondent that it first acquired know­ledge of the claimant's
illness when it received on <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="9">September
 11, 1967</st1:date> the claim for compensation which was served upon it by the
<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Sub-Regional Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection it presented evidence
showing that on <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1967</st1:date>,
or within ten days from receipt of the claim, it filed its corresponding
employer's reports containing its <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> with
Regional Office No. 4 Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
score, we are willing to grant, in the liberal interpretation of the Rules of
the Workmen's Compensation Commission to promote the ends of justice, that
there was substantial compliance in so far as the act of the physical filing of
the reports is concerned, considering that by law, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City Sub-Regional Office 4 still stands as an integral part of Regional Office
No. 4, Manila."</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commission, after an
examination of the <span class="SpellE">photostat</span> copies of the reports,
the originals of which were filed with its Manila regional office, expressly
sustained the award having been made without need of hearing on the merits due
to petitioner's failure to controvert respondent's right to compensation in
accordance with law, more specifically in the following particulars:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent failed to comply with the form
and substance required for the notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
by failing to state 'in clear terms the grounds or reasons for <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> the employee's rights to compensation (Sec.
2, Rule 8, Rules of the Commission); for in Item 7 of the Employer's Report
(WCC Form No. 3), the respondent was content to answer a simple 'Yes' to the
question, 'State whether you will controvert the claim for compensation in this
case'; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent failed to comply with the sub­stantial
requirements in <span style="">the </span>accomplishment
of the em­ployer's report required under Sec. 37 of the Act for pur­poses of
administration and under Rule 7 of the Rules of the Commission for the purpose
of serving as an answer."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's main
contention that "the commission cannot prescribe a form to serve as notice
of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> and then discard it as insufficient,
in form and substance, <u>when answered as instructed,</u> especially when the
form prescribed was prepared, printed, utilized, supplied, furnished and
provided by it"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is not borne out by the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the commission noted "from the Employer's Report (WCC
Form No. 3) submitted by the respondent, that aside from the personal
employment data of the claimant, <u>the former avoided the submission of
relevant information regarding the circumstances surrounding the illness of the
claimant, such as its nature and cause, date and probable length of disability
(Items 18 to 33) by the simple expedient of answering the ques­tions for each
item with the phrase 'Not applicable'</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Sec. 37 of the Act, it is the duty of the employer, under pain of
penal sanction, to give such information which it is presumed conclusively by
law to be in posses­sion of or to have access to."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reproduced <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> in part are the evasive answers given by
petitioner to the numerous questions expressly asked in the commission's
printed notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> in accordance with
the commission's rules requiring the employer to state its reasons for <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>:</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds no error
in law in the commission's rulings that petitioner merely "pretended not
to know of the claimant's illness, <span style="">yet
it knew and reported the name of his attending physician, Dr. Mario C. <span class="SpellE">Lirag</span>, as well as the name and address of the hospital
where he was confined, namely, the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute
in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Further­more, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lirag</span> certified in his
physician's report that he commenced treatment on the claimant for his
pulmonary tuberculosis on March 30, </u></span><u>1967, which since then had
caused the claimant total temporary disability for labor for an indefinite period.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement is corroborative of, and
consistent with the allegation of the claimant in his claim that on <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1967</st1:date>, he <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> blood while operating the cone-winding ma­chine of
the (petitioner), as a result of which he had to stop working since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the foregoing considerations, the
disclaimer of the (petitioner) as to any knowledge of the claimant's illness
and his subsequent disability acquires a hollow and false ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, <u>one is impelled
to believe that the (petitioner) learned of the claimant's disabi­lity on </u><st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="3"><u>March 28, 1967</u></st1:date><u>, on the same
day it began, and it was therefore in­cumbent upon it to have <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the right to compensation of the claimant
within a period of 14 days after such disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as al­ready alluded to, it filed the
employer's report only on </u><st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="9"><u>September
 19, 1967</u></st1:date><u> containing a pro-forma statement of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, which as we have pointed out, is fatally
deficient in form and substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if
such notice had been filed on time, it may not under the circumstance, be
considered a valid <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court further finds
that the commission therefore correctly ruled that "the failure to
controvert within the period prescribed by law works as a forfeiture of all
non-jurisdictional defenses available under the Act, including the defense that
the claim is not compensable", in accordance with section 45 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, and long-settled jurisprudence.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consequences of such
failure to controvert were thus cor­rectly stated by the commission:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>In specific terms, it means that the
res</u><u><span style="">pondent may not interpose and
prove by evidence its affirmative defenses in avoidance of its liability</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
view thereof, the evidence of the claimant showing that his illness was
aggravated by the nature and conditions of his employment with the respondent
stands <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the records show that upon examination by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lirag</span>
of the claimant immediately after the latter suffered <span class="SpellE">hemoptysis</span>
which he alleged occurred on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="3"><span style="">March 28, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> in the course of employment, <u>it was found
out that he had moderately ad­vanced pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the nature of his work as machine
operator, his illness would not have progressed to an advanced stage without having
been aggravated one way or the other by the exertion and strain inherent in the
performance of the duties of his job.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After he stopped working and underwent treatment at the hands of a
competent phy­sician, his illness began to regress, a fact which further
accrues to em­phasize by implication, its work-connection</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, we need not even
invoke the statutory presumption of compensability to tilt the balance in favor
of the claimant."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it must be noted
that petitioner's motion for reconsideration against the <u>award</u>, which
found that "an examination of the records show that no such employer's
report (with <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>) was filed by
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting for the sake of
argument that this office received the same, yet the claim cannot be considered
<span class="SpellE">controverted</span> as alleged, pursuant to section 4, Rule
6 of the Workmen's Compensation Commission,"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as its motion for reconsideration of the <u>de­cision</u> affirming the
award on the ground of alleged timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
and for an opportunity "to present its evidence showing its non-liability
to the claim of the claimant" <u>both</u> suffer from fatal defects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were neither verified nor were
affidavits of merit appended to support its peti­tion for a new hearing, which
would properly indicate that it has a valid defense against the claim and the
nature thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If the new hearing insisted upon by petitioner would not after
all alter the conclusions reached in the decision upon the evidence of record
and hence the alleged defense against the claim is legally ineffective, it
would be a needless waste of time and would merely undermine the law's measure
of public policy designed to compel due observance of the statutory
requirements as well as to protect the rights of the claimant worker<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
to set aside the decision and to remand the case for a new hearing, as sought
in the petition.</p>
