				<BR><STRONG>R EYES, J.B.L., Acting C.J.,:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for certiorari against the order of the Judge
presiding over Branch I, Eighth <span style="">Judicial
</span>District, Court of Agrarian Relations, maintaining the dismissal of Case
No. 700 of said Court, allegedly issued in grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Lucero, claiming to be the
tenant of one-half (eastern portion) of four parcels of coconut land owned by
Loreto, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>, Sergio and <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>, petitioned the Court of Agra­rian
Relations (Branch I, in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City) for a judgment
ordering, among others, therein respondents landowners to desist from ejecting
him (petitioner) from the landholding in question; to deliver to him his
alleged lawful share in the harvests from December, 1963 and there­after; to
make a <span class="SpellE">reliquidation</span> and accounting of previous
harvests, from 1949 to January, 1964; to deliver to petitioner whatever share
he may still be entitled under the law; and to reimburse him attorney's fees
and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, respondents filed their answer traversing the aver­ments
of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the case
was set for pre-trial conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1964</st1:date>,
when the case was called for pre-trial meeting at <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time>
in the morning, petitioner was not present, al­though his counsel as well as
the other parties were there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
the assurance of his counsel that petitioner would come, the court declared a
recess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as petitioner was still
not around when the session was resumed at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10
 o'clock</st1:time>, the judge granted respondents' verbal motion and ordered
the dismissal of the case with prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration of the
order of dismissal, with prayer that the pre-trial conference be set for
another date, alleging that petitioner's failure to arrive in court on time was
for reasons beyond the latter's control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This motion was accompanied by a sworn statement of petitioner to the
effect that he left his house for the court on August 6, 1964 at about 6:00 in
the morning; that as resident of <u>barrio</u> <span class="SpellE">Quipot</span>,
he had to walk a distance of about three kilometers to reach the town-proper of
<span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span>; that his trip through this stretch of road
was delayed because he was a sick man<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and the road was under water caused by the rain of the previous night; that he
arrived in <span class="SpellE">Tiaong</span> at about 9 in the morning; that he
happened to board a baby-bus that made frequent stops to pick up and unload
passengers, and he reached the court in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City
after 10 o'clock.</p>

<p class="BODY">By resolution of October 1, 1964, the motion for reconsidera­tion
was denied, the court ruling that while petitioner's late arrival for the
pre-trial meeting may be excusable, the affidavit of merits attached to the
motion failed to state the valid cause of action which petitioner intended to prove,
as required by Section 2 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenant, consequently, instituted the
present proceeding, charging the respondent Judge of having gravely abused his
discretion in refusing to reconsider the order of dis­missal of Case No. 700.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The denial of petitioner's motion for reconsideration, allegedly for
non-compliance with the requirements of Section 2 of Rule 37, was
erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, there was
no sense in requiring that the affidavit of merits should state the plaintiff's
cause of action, because that was already pleaded in the complaint filed in the
same Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the provisions of
Rule 37, on New Trial, do not govern all motions for reconsideration based on
fraud, accident, excusable negligence or mistake; they are appli­cable only
when a party, adversely affected by a judgment already rendered in a case,
seeks to have it set aside and a new trial held, in the hope that the aforesaid
judgment may be reversed or modified on account of the evidence that is to be
produced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, if a new trial is indeed
granted, the original decision shall be vacated and the action is to stand for
trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure contem­plated under this Rule,
therefore, involves a reopening of the case for hearing, after it was already
submitted for decision and a judgment thereon was actually reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the reopening would necessarily affect
the party in whose favor the disputed judgment was rendered, the Rule requires
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to show the valid cause of action or
defense which he intends to prove at the new trial, to prevent this remedy from
being utilized merely to delay termination of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">But in the case at bar, the proceeding below had not gone beyond
the pre-trial stage; the parties had not as yet adduced any evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A postponement of the pre-trial to another
date would not have caused the respondents landowners irreparable damage or
prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal is the more
unjustified, because according to the lower court itself, the failure of
petitioner to arrive on time for the pre-trial conference was excusable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, this is not an occasion for the
enforcement of the precautionary measure prescribed in Rule 37.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion filed in this case, being nothing
but a simple pleading for reconsideration of the order of non suit, need not be
accompanied by an affidavit of merits except to show the true cause of the
failure to appear at the pre-trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the granting or denial of a motion for re­consideration
involves an exercise of discretion, and bearing in mind the strictures of
Article 24 of the Civil Code of the Philippines,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
it cannot be gainsaid that there had been a patent abuse of discretion when
petitioner's motion, which is meritorious and in due form, was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action of the court may be properly
questioned in an action for certiorari.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The delays of an ordinary appeal render it an inadequate remedy in the
circumstances obtaining in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of certiorari is granted; the order of
dismissal, of <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1964</st1:date>,
as well as the resolution of <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1964</st1:date>, issued by the lower court are hereby set aside, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
