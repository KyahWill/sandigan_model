<p class="BODY">And now to the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The word BAYER was the surname of Friedrich Bayer, a German, who,

a drug com­pany bearing his name – <span class="SpellE">Friedr</span>. Bayer et

manufac­ture and sale of chemicals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At

also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A change of name from <span class="SpellE">Friedr</span>. Bayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To <span class="SpellE">Farbenfabriken</span> <span class="SpellE">vorm</span>. <span class="SpellE">Friedr</span>. Bayer 8 Co. (FFB, for short) effective July 1, 1881

Its products came to be known outside <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the discovery<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in 1899 of the Bayer Aspirin, the mark BAYER

purchase of the Bayer Co., Inc. Winthrop's operation was evidently hampered
because ‘the Germans had kept manufacturing processes secret, so that the
manufacture of physicians' drugs on a commercial scale became an almost

in the Philippines and the penalties provided for in the pertinent law on
trademarks and being aware also that Supplemental Registration is not a prima

the mark is actually being used by the applicant in the Philippines, it is
respectfully urged that this [application] be given due course."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1960</st1:date>,
FBA was issued a certificate of registration in the Supplemental Register,
SR-304.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now grapple with the problems raised in the separate appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rule widely accepted
and firmly entrenched because it has come down through the years is that actual
use in commerce or business is a prerequisite to the acquisition of the right
of ownership over a trademark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule
is spelled out in our Trademark Law, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“SEC.2-A. <u>Ownership</u> <u>of</u> <u>trade</u>-<u>marks</u>, <u>trade</u>-<u>names</u>
<u>and service</u>-<u>marks;</u> <u>how</u> <u>acquired</u>. - Anyone who
lawfully produces or deals in merchandise of any kind or who engages in any
lawful business, or who renders any lawful service in commerce, by actual use
thereof in manufacture or trade, in business, and in the service rendered, may
appropriate to his exclusive use a trade-mark, a trade-name, or a service-mark
not so appropriated by another, to distinguish his merchandise, business or
service from the merchandise, business or service of others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ownership or possession of a trade-mark,
trade-name, service-mark, heretofore or hereafter <span class="SpellE">approriated</span>,
as in this section provided, shall be recognized and protected in the same
manner and to the same extent as are other property rights known to the
law." (As inserted by Section 1 of Republic Act 638).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would seen quite clear that adoption alone of a trademark
would not give exclusive right thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such right “grows out of their actual use.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Adoption is not use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One may make
advertisements, issue circulars, give out price lists on certain goods; but
these alone would not give exclusive right of use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For trademark is a creation of use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The underlying reason for all these is that
purchasers have come to understand the mark as indicating the origin of the
wares.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Flowing from this is the trader's right to protection in the trade he has built
up and the goodwill he has accumulate from use of the trademark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Registration of a trademark of course, has
value:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it is an administrative act
declaratory of a pre-<span class="SpellE">existingright</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Registration does not, however, perfect a
trademark right.</p>

<p class="BODY">The BAYER trademarks registered in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to which plaintiff SPI may lay claim, as correctly stated in the decision
below, are those which cover <u>medicines</u> only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, it was on said goods that the BAYER
trademarks were actually used by it in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the certificates of registration
for medicines issued the Director of Patents upon which the protection is
enjoyed only for medicines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in
those certificates recited would include chemicals or insecticides.</p>

<p class="BODY">But plaintiff insists that the statement of the applicant (The
Bayer Co., Inc.) in its registrations of the BAYER marks states that “the merchandise
for which the trademark is appropriated is d. – Chemicals Medicines and
Pharmaceutical Preparations”.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's position is that such statement determines the goods for
which said marks had been registered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Validity does not attach to this proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>, the statement itself admits
that the particular description of the articles comprised in said class (d) on
which the trademark is used is Medicines.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not used for <u>chemicals</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Then</u>, Section 11 of the Trademark Law requires that the
certificate of registration state “<u>the</u> <u>particular</u> goods x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>for</u> <u>which</u> <u>it</u>
<u>is</u> <u>registered</u>.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 11 aforesaid,
likewise to be entered in the certificate of registration is “<u>the</u> <u>date</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>first</u> <u>use</u> in commerce or business.” SPI may
not claim “first use” of the trademarks prior to the registrations thereof on
any product other than medicines.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Besides</u>, Section 7 of the same Trademark Act directs that
upon the filling of the application and the payment of the required fee, the
Director [of Patents] shall cause an examination of the application" - for
registration of the trademark – “to be made, and, if on such examination it
shall appear that the applicant <u>is</u> <u>entitled</u> <u>to</u> <u>registration</u>,
the Director x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall
cause the mark x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to be
published in the Official Gazette.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
examination, it would seem to us, is necessary in order that the Director of
Patents may be satisfied that the application conforms to the requirement of <u>actual</u>
<u>use</u> in commerce of the trademark in Sections 2 and 2-A of the Trademark
Law; and that the statement in said application - as to the “first use” thereof
and “the <u>goods</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
in connection with which the mark x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> is used” (Section 5) - is true.</p>

<p class="BODY">Really, if the certificate of registration were to be deemed as including
goods <u>not</u> specified therein, than a situation may arise whereby an
applicant may be tempted to register a trademark on any and all goods which his
mind may conceive even if he had never intended to use the trademark for the
said goods.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We believe that such
omnibus registration is not contemplated by our Trademark Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of this and of the fact that the BAYER trade­marks were
never used in the Philippines by plaintiff except for medicines - <span class="SpellE">Asprin</span>, Aspirin for Children and <span class="SpellE">Cafiaspirina</span>
- we find ourselves unwilling to draw a hard and fast rule which would
absolutely and under all circumstances give unqualified protection to plaintiff
against the use of said trademarks by all others on goods other than medicines.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither will the 1827
registration in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the BAYER trademark for insecticides serve plain­tiff any The United States
is not the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
registration in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is not registration in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> registration in 1927, we had our own
Trademark Law, Act No. 666 afore­said of the Philippine Commission, which
provided for registration here of trademarks owned by persons domiciled in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is to be secured from unfair competition in a given
territory is the trade which one has in that particular territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is where his business is carried on;
where the goodwill symbolized by the trademark has immediate value; where the
infringer may profit by infringement.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing new in what we now say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff itself concedes<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
that the principle of territoriality of the Trademark Law has been recognized in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
citing <span class="SpellE">Ingenohl</span> vs. Walter E. Olsen, 71 L. ed.
762.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Callmann</span>
puts it, the law of trademarks “rests upon the doctrine of nationality or
territoriality.”<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the 1927 registration in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> of the BAYER trademark would not of
itself afford plaintiff protection for the use by defendants in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the same trademark for the same or different products.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A question basic in the
field of trademarks and unfair competition is the extent to which a registrant
of a trademark covering one product may invoke the right to protection against
the use 'by other(s) of the same trademark to identify merchandise different
from those for which the trademark has been appropriated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff's trenchant claim is that it should not he turned away
because its case comes within the protection of the <u>confusion</u> <u>of</u> <u>origin</u>
rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Callmann</span>
notes two types of confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
is the <u>confusion</u> <u>of</u> <u>goods</u> “in which event the ordinarily
prudent purchaser would be induced to purchase one product in the belief that
he was purchasing the other.” In which case, “defendant's goods are then bought
as the plaintiff's, and the poorer quality of the former reflects adversely on
the plaintiff's reputation.” The other is the <u>confusion</u> <u>of</u> <u>business</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Here though the goods of the parties are
different, the defendant's product is such as might reasonably be assumed to
originate with the plaintiff, and the public would then be deceived either into
that belief or into the belief that there is some connection between the
plaintiff and defendant which, in fact, does not exist.”<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A judicial test giving the scope of the rule of confusion of
origin is <span class="SpellE"><u>Ang</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Teodoro</u></span>
(December 14, 1942), 74 Phil. 50.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Briefly, the facts of the just cited case are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, at first in partnership with Juan <span class="SpellE">Katindig</span> and later as sole proprietor, had continuously

both as trademark and as <span class="SpellE">tradename</span> in the manufacture
and sale of slippers, shoes and indoor baseballs since 1910 be formally

manufacture of said articles in 1937. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Suit was lodged by <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> to cancel the latter's registration of
the trademark "<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span>"
and to perpetually enjoin her from using the said trademark on goods
manufactured and sold by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judgment of the trial court absolved defendant (Ana L. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>)
from the complaint with costs against the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal by <i style="">certiorari</i>, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We there said:</p>

<blockquote>“In the present state of development of the law on Trade-Marks, Unfair
Competition, and Unfair Trading, the test employed by the courts to determine
whether <span class="SpellE">noncompeting</span> goods are or are not of the same
class is <u>confusion</u> <u>as</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>origin</u> of the
goods of the second user.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Although</u>
<u>two</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>noncompeting</u></span> <u>articles</u> may be
classified under two different classes by the Patent Office because they are
deemed not to possess the same descriptive properties, <u>they</u> <u>would</u>
nevertheless, <u>be</u> <u>held</u> by the courts <u>to</u> <u>belong</u> <u>to</u>
<u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>class</u> if the simultaneous use on them of
identical or closely similar trademarks <u>would</u> <u>be</u> <u>likely</u> to
cause confusion as to the origin or personal source, of the second user's
goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would be considered as <u>not</u>
falling under the same class <u>only</u> if they are so only dissimilar or so
foreign to each other <u>as</u> <u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>it</u> <u>unlikely</u>
that the purchaser would think the first user made the second user's
goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Such construction of the law is induced by cogent reasons of equity
and fair dealing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The courts have come
to realize that there can be unfair competition or unfair trading even if the
goods are non competing, and that such unfair trading can cause <u>injury</u>
or <u>damage</u> to the first user of a given trade-mark, first, by prevention
of the natural expansion of his business and, second, by having his business
reputation confused with and put at the mercy of the second user.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When noncompetitive products are sold under
the same mark, the <u>gradual</u> <u>whittling</u> <u>away</u> or <u>dispersion</u>
of the identity and hold of upon the public mind of the mark created by its first
user, inevitably results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>original</u>

between him and the public that has been <u>created</u> <u>by</u> <u>his</u> <u>ingenuity</u>
and <u>the</u> <u>merit</u> <u>of</u> <u>his</u> <u>wares</u> or services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience has demonstrated that when a
well-known trademark is adopted by another even for a totally different class
of goods, it is done <u>to</u> <u>get</u> <u>the</u> <u>benefit</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>reputation</u>, and advertisements <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>originator</u> of
said mark, to convey to the public a false impression of <u>some</u> <u>supposed</u>
<u>connection</u> between the manufacturer of the article sold under the
original mark and the new articles being tendered to the public under the same
or similar mark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As trade has developed
and commercial changes have come about, the law of unfair competition has
expanded to keep pace with the times and the element of strict competition in
itself has ceased to be the determining factor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The owner of a trade-mark or trade-name has a property right in which he
is entitled to protection, since there is <u>damage</u> to him from confusion
of reputation or goodwill in the mind of the public as well as from confusion
of goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The modern trend is to give
emphasis to the <u>unfairness</u> often acts and to classify and treat the
issue as a fraud."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

</span>And the reasons, so well stated, by His Honor, are these: </p>

<blockquote>"1st). – It was not plaintiff's predecessor but defendant's
namely <span class="SpellE">Farbenfabriken</span> or Bayer Germany that first
introduced the Medical products into the Philippine market and household with
the Bayer mark half a century ago; this is what the Court gathers from the
testimony of Frederick <span class="SpellE">Umbreit</span> and this is the
implication even of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 48, 49, 66 and WWW as
already shown a few pages back;<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>2nd). – There is thus reason plausible enough for defendants’ plea
that as Sterling was not the ‘originator’ of the Bayer mark, the rule in <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, supra, is not
applicable; and this is correct notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
106 and 63 and even giving unto these documents full force and virtue, because
purchase of the assets of <span class="SpellE">Elberfeld</span>, defendants’
previous affiliate in New York, by Bayer of New York, even if that were to be
held to include purchase of the Bayer mark, did not Make the purchaser Bayer of
New York the originator of the mark; especially since Bayer of New York was
only another subsidiary of Bayer Germany or <span class="SpellE">Farbenfabriken</span>
which was the real <u>originator</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3rd). –<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is also
impelled to believe that the evidence establishes that among the common people
of the Philippines the 'Bayer' medicines come from Germany; this the Court
deduces from the testimony of witness <span class="SpellE">Florisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Pestaño</span> who only reproduced the belief of her grandmother;
the Court might as well say<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
plaintiff itself has not discouraged that belief because the drug and its
literature that came from the plaintiff and its affiliate would show that it <u>represented</u>
its medicines to have come from defendant<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
and were manufactured in Germany with that Bayer mark; thus <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

which is the price list of 1928 of <span class="SpellE">Botica</span> de Sta.
Cruz on page 6 indicates that Winthrop Chemical Company of New York, -
plaintiff's subsidiary - was a distributor of I.G. <span class="SpellE">Farbenindustrie</span>,
A.G. <span class="SpellE">Leverkusen</span>, Germany; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

which is a medical diary published by Winthrop for 1934 on page 148 manifested
that the journal, 'Practical Therapeutics’ was published by I.G. <span class="SpellE">Farbenindustrie</span> <span class="SpellE">Aktiengesellschaft</span>
for Winthrop Chemical Company Inc.; 'with particular reference to the
pharmacological products, sera and vaccines originated and prepared in the
laboratories of I.G. <span class="SpellE">Farbenindustrie</span>, A.G.'; and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 79 a, b, c, d and e which are prospectuses for the

showed that these products were manufactured for Winthrop by I.G. <span class="SpellE">Farbenindustrie</span>; and then <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 81
the <span class="SpellE">Revista</span> <span class="SpellE">Boie</span> of 1928 would
show that Winthrop represented itself as the distributor of the products of
Bayer of Germany otherwise known as I.G. <span class="SpellE">Farbenindustrie</span>,
“<span class="SpellE">segun</span> la <span class="SpellE">alta</span> <span class="SpellE">calidad</span> de la <span class="SpellE">marca</span> original’;<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court being also impelled to add in this connection that it has to take judicial
notice of a belief of long standing common among the people in the Philippines
that German products are of very high quality and it is only natural for a
distributor or a retailer to take advantage of that; and as it is not debated
that 'Bayer' is a German surname, (see plaintiff's rebuttal <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
QQQQ, see also p. 7 plaintiff's reply memorandum wherein it is said that this
surname is a 'pretty common one among members of the German race') it is all so
very easy to associate the Bayer trademark with products that come from Germany
and to believe that they are of high quality;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4th). – The rationale of the doctrine in <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, supra being that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'The Courts have come
to realize that there can be unfair competition or unfair trading even if the goods
are non-competing, and that such unfair trading can cause injury or damage to
the first user of a given trade mark, first, by prevention of the natural
expansion of his business, and second, by having his business reputation
confused with and put at the mercy of the second user.' 74 Phil. 55-56;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and the Court having found out that the
‘first user’ was Bayer Germany and it was this that had built up the Bayer mark
and plaintiff apparently having itself encouraged that belief even after it had
acquired the Bayer mark in America, thru forced sale, of defendant's subsidiary
there in 1918, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 79, 80, 81, to apply the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> rule in the manner
advocated by <st1:city><st1:place>Sterling</st1:place></st1:city> would, the

<p class="BODY">It would seem to us that the fact that plaintiff rode on the
German reputation in the Bayer trademark has diluted the rationality of its
exclusionary claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that the free
ride in the name of defendant’s German predecessor was sporadic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is continuing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof of this is the label on the box used by

product.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that your child is
getting the same gentle-to-the-System Bayer Aspirin that has been used for over
50 years by millions of normal people without ill effect."</p>

<p class="BODY">With the background of prior use in the Philippines of the word
BAYER by FBA 's German predecessor and the prior representations that plaintiff's
medicines sold in the Philippines were manufactured in Germany, the facts just
recited hammer on the mind of the public that the Aspirin, <span class="SpellE">Cafiaspirina</span>
and Aspirin for Children being marketed for plaintiff in the Philippines come
from the same source - the German source - and in use since 1900.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this view is far from far-fetched, is
illustrated by the testimony of plaintiff's own witness Dr. Antonio Vasquez, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Q. Have you ever heard of a pharmaceutical company of Bayer
of Germany, or a company in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ang</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Tibay</u></span> doctrine, we believe, is not to be read

Plaintiff cannot now say that the present worth of its BAYER trademarks it owes
solely to its own efforts; it is not insulated from the charge that as it
marketed its medicines it did so with an eye to the goodwill as to quality that
defendants' predecessor had established.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no whittling away of the identity of plaintiff's
trademarks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff is not the first
user thereof in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trademarks do not necessarily link
plaintiff with the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff
must show injury; it has not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'On the
contrary, representations as to the place of manufacture of plaintiff's
medicines were untrue, misleading.<span style="">&nbsp;

Appropriate it is to recall here our observation in the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> opinion, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:
"On our part may we add, without meaning to be harsh, that a
self-respecting person does not remain in the shelter of another but builds one
of his own.”<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, the owner in this country of the trademarks BAYER for
medicines, has thus forfeited its right to protection from the use of the same
trademarks by defendants for products different <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
- insecticides and other chemicals.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But defendants ask us to
<span class="SpellE">delist</span> plaintiff's BAYER – trademarks for medicines
from the Principal Register claiming right thereto for said use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said trademarks had been registered since
1939 by plaintiff's predecessor, The Bayer Co., Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants' claim is stale; it suffers from the defect of
non-use.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
While it is conceded that <span class="SpellE">FBA's</span> predecessors first
introduced medical products with the BAYER trademarks in the Philippine market,
it is equally true that, after World War I no definite evidence there is that
defendants or their predecessors traded in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in medicines with the BAYER trademarks thereafter. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>FBA did not seasonably voice its
objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of protest thereto
connoted acquiescence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, notwithstanding
the fact that the 1923 and 1926 agreements were set aside in the anti-trust
suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants did use the marks; but
it was much later, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., in 1958 – and on chemicals and
insecticides - not on medicines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FBA
only bestirred itself and challenged plaintiff's right to the trademarks on
medicines when this suit filed <span class="SpellE"><u>Vigilantibus</u></span> <u>non</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>dormientibus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>equitas</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>subvenit</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The net result is that, as the trial court aptly observed,
plaintiff may hold on to its BAYER trademarks for medicines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And defendants may continue using the same
trademarks for insecticides and other chemicals, not medicines.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants balk at the
ruling below which directs them "to ad a distinctive word or words in
their mark to indicate that their products come from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are left under no doubt as to the reasonableness of the
formula thus fashioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It avoids the
mischief of confusion of origin - defendant <span class="SpellE">FBA's</span>
products would not be mistaken for those of plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reduces friction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We perceive of no prejudice to defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order does not visit defendant FBA with
reprobation or condemnation. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Rather,
said defendant would be enhancing the value of and would be sponsoring its own
products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, a statement that its
products come from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is but a statement of fact.</p>
