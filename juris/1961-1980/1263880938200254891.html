				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for a review of the decision of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, reversing the decision of the Labor Provincial Office
No. VII of San Jose, Antique, granting death benefits to the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> Francisco as the surviving spouse of Aida <span class="SpellE">Madarcos</span> Francisco, a public school teacher for about 12
years at <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caluya</span></span><span style="">, </span>Antique.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are the facts not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deceased Aida <span class="SpellE">Madarcos</span> Francisco
had been employed by the respondent Bureau of Public Schools as a public school
teacher with station at <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span>, Antique since <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1962</st1:date> continuously up to the <span style="">time of her death on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10"><span style="">October
 19, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While she was teaching,
she was assigned to an elevated place where she had to go up and down and had
to hike all the way from the school to her house and <u>vice</u> <u>versa</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During and in the course
of her employment and long before the time of her death, she complained of
headache, although she continued to discharge her duties as her services were
needed by the respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime in 1974, while
she was on the family way, she was again attacked by the same ailment but she
was not able to file her leave of absence as she was then not yet entitled to
apply for a maternity leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account
of her ailment, she consulted Dr. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ausan</span>, the
rural health physician of <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>, Antique who was
also assigned as rural health physician of <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span>,
Antique and she was diagnosed to be suffering from hypertension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Later, in the same year,
she was again attacked by the same ailment and had to be confined in a hospital
at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Jose</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
where she died on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10"><span style="">October 19, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
physician </span>found <span style="">the cause of her
death to be that of <u>post</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>eclampsia</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of her death, the
herein petitioner filed a claim for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim was favorably decided in
his favor by Acting Referee of the Labor Provincial Office of Antique as per
his decision dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="10"><span style="">October 30, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent Bureau of
Public Schools appealed the decision of the Hearing Officer to the respondent
Workmen's Compensation Commission, which decided the claim adverse to the
herein claimant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition,
which was treated as a special civil action and both parties</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">were
required to submit simultaneous memoranda.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The lone assignment of error raised is:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"THAT</span> <span style="">THE</span> <span style="">RESPONDENT </span><span style="">WORKMEN'S </span><span style="">COMPENSATION</span> <span style="">COMMISSION ERRED AND ACTED </span><span style="">WITH GRAVE </span>ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED THE CLAIM FOR
COMPENSATION FILED BY THE HEREIN PETITIONER BY STATING THAT THE AILMENT OF POST
<span class="SpellE">ECLAMPSIA</span> WHICH CAUSED THE DEATH OF THE LATE AIDA <span class="SpellE">MADARCOS</span> FRANCISCO HAD NO CAUSAL RELATION WITH THE NATURE
OF HER EMPLOYMENT AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that <u>post</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>eclampsia</u></span>
which was found to be the cause of death of the late Aida <span class="SpellE">Madarcos</span>
Francisco was aggravated by, if <span style="">not </span>the
direct result of, her employment as a public school teacher.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General, on the other hand, contends
that <u>post <span class="SpellE">eclampsia</span></u>, which was diagnosed as
the cause of her death, was a condition brought about by childbirth and not by
her work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission failed to
respect the presumption of compensability, as <span style="">long as </span>the illness or death supervened during employment.
"So rigid is the rule that even when the cause of the employee's death is
unknown x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the right to
compensation subsists" (<span class="SpellE">Itemcop</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Florzo</span>, 17 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 1104; <span class="SpellE">Magpantay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">WC<span style="">C</span></span>, et <span style="">al.,
L-43457<span style="">,</span> </span>Oct. 26, 1976; <span class="SpellE">Leorna</span>, <span style="">et al. vs. </span><span class="SpellE">WCC</span>, et al., Sept. 30, 1976).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is ample evidence of compensability.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to medical authorities, <span class="SpellE"><u>eclampsia</u></span>
is an attack of convulsions, but more often it refers to a seizure of
convulsions <span class="SpellE">occuring</span> in late pregnancy, during labor,
or after delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the cause is
not known, the condition is associated with, among others, a rising blood
pressure or hypertension.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<span class="SpellE"><u>Eclampsia</u></span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This term refers to an attack of convulsions
which may be due to any one of a number of conditions, but more often it refers
to a seizure of convulsions <span class="SpellE">occuring</span> <span style="">in late </span>pregnancy, during labor, or
after delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause is not known,
but the condition is associated with an involvement of the kidneys and a rising
blood pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At such times the body
is said to be in a state<span style=""> </span>of
toxemia, which means <span class="SpellE">intoxification</span> with poisons
formed in the body, as by the faulty action of<span style=""> </span>the kidneys and possibly other organs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The convulsions often follow severe vomiting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first signs are disturbances of vision
and headache.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The treatment aims at
relieving the kidneys and lowering the blood pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Sedatives are used to
control the convulsions" (Schmidt's Attorney's Dictionary of Medicine, p.
251).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Hypertension</u>, or excessive
tension or pressure, especially high blood <span style="">pressure </span>is found more frequently in
people who<span style="">&nbsp; </span>are overweight or who are
under emotional <span style="">strain" (Ibid., </span>pp.
378, 363).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Eclampsia</u></span>, therefore, may be due
to a seizure of convulsions which may occur after delivery (<u>post</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>eclampsia</u></span>), a condition associated with hypertension
or high blood pressure frequently found in people who are under emotional
strain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, as found by the
Labor Provincial Office No. VII of San Jose, Antique, long before her death,
while Aida <span class="SpellE">Madarcos</span> Francisco was employed with the
respondent, she already complained of headache in 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And later in the same year, while she was on
the family way, she was again attacked by the same ailment but she continued
working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She consulted <span style="">Dr. </span>Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ausan</span>,
the rural health physician<span style=""> </span>of <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caluya</span>, Antique, who
also found her to be suffering from<span style=""> </span>hypertension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, in the same year, 1974, she was
attacked with hypertension and she had to be confined in a hospital in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Jose</st1:place></st1:city>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
where she died on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the cause of her death was <span style="">pronounced </span>as "<u>Post</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Eclampsia</u></span>," it is not hard to explain that this
ailment could have <span style="">been </span>aggravated
by, if not the direct result of, her hypertension suffered <span style="">during </span>and in the course of her
employment as public school teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>may be added, that while the late
school teacher was employed as such, she had to walk from their house to the
school where she was teaching and <u>vice</u> <u>versa</u> and had to climb an
elevation as the school building was on an elevated portion, thereby making her
susceptible to be attacked with hypertension or the same had been aggravated by
such strenuous physical exertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
school teacher, she had to perform non-classroom duties like actual
demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had to prepare her
lesson plan during nighttime and had to stand during classes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these physical and mental activities
could have contributed to her sickness or hypertension and aggravated it at a
time when she was on the family way.</p>
