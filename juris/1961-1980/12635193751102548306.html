				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This Court is faced with a question raised for the first time in
this petition for the review of a ruling of an order of respondent General
Auditing Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is whether or not an
elective official may be entitled in the event that he voluntarily retires or
be sepa­rated from the service without fault on his part to the commutation of
his vacation and sick leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer
of respondent was in the negative, relying primarily on a civil service rule
purportedly in accordance with the applicable Administrative Code provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In thus denying the claim of petitioner,
there was a neglect or dis­regard of the controlling section of such Code<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as of the equally controlling statutory language in another enactment,
which specifically speaks of both an elective or appointive official as being
entitled to such benefits under such circum­stances.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reversal is thus indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Benito C. Manuel applied for retirement, effective December
31, 1967, according to law,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
after having to his credit more than twenty (20) years of service in the government,
included in which were four successive terms as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> from January 1, 1952 to December 31,
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such application was approved on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had likewise sought the commutation of his
vacation and sick leave, filing with the Municipal Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1967</st1:date> a communication to
that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his memorandum filed
with respondent General Auditing Office to which the matter was referred, he
stressed that he was entitled to unused vacation and sick leave earned from May
31, 1957 (date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Republic Act No.
1616) to December 31, 1967, or a period of 10 years and 7 months, and since his
highest salary was P600.00 a month, the total amount which should accrue to him
is P6,000.00, (one month for every year).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Office in turn asked for the view of the Commissioner of
Civil Service in an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reply, coming on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1968</st1:date> was that such a claim for the
commutation of the money value of his leave from <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1952</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date> could not be favorably considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a conclusion was based on his reading of
Section 2187 of the Revised Administrative Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which for him implied that such a leave must be enjoyed during the year <span style="">in whic</span>h earned and that it could not
be cumulative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was likewise
reliance on Section 9 of Civil Service Rule XVI which speaks categorically to
that effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent General Auditing Office on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="3">March
 1, 1968</st1:date> ruled that his appli­cation for commutation of his leave
earned as Mayor during the period from <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1952</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31,
 1967</st1:date> could not thus be allowed in audit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As was clearly pointed out in the able brief of counsel for petitioner,
the <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, Villegas &amp; <span class="SpellE">Zarraga</span>
Law Firm, the controlling statutory provisions call for a reversal of the
ruling of respondent.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is expressly provided
under Section 286 of the Revised Administrative Code that vacation and sick
leave shall be cumulative, any part thereof not taken within the calendar year
earned being carried over the succeeding years with the employee voluntarily
retiring or being sepa­rated from the service without fault on his part, being
entitled to the commutation of all such accumulated vacation or sick leave to
his credit provided that it shall in no case exceed ten (10) months.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The statute<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
providing for voluntary retirement is even more explicit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Retirement is likewise allowed to any official or employee,
appointive or elective, regardless of age and employment status, who has
rendered a total of at least twenty years of service, the last three years of
which are continuous."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Further:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Officials and employees
retired under this Act shall be entitled to the commutation of the unused
vacation and sick leave, based on the highest rate received, which they may
have to their credit at the time of retirement."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">There cannot be the least doubt therefore that the petitioner,
who was a municipal mayor and as such an elective official for sixteen (16)
years, having to his credit four (4) successive terms as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, could not
be denied his plea for the commutation for a vacation and sick leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law speaks categorically including him
within its terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must, as insisted
by counsel for petitioner, be obeyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever rights are granted petitioner must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is here no room for interpretation,
simply the application of legal norms free from any ambiguity.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why then did respondent
decide otherwise?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have been due
to a misreading of Section 2187 of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What must have misled respondent was a
failure to take due note that this section deals solely with a situation when a
municipal mayor is absent from his office because of illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not cover therefore the specific case
here presented of the right of the elective official to a commutation of his
vacation and sick leave upon his retirement or separation from the service
through no fault of his own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover it
must have felt justified in view of the endorsement of the Commissioner of the
Civil Service, who applied Section 9 of Civil Service Rule XVI, included in
which is the express injunction that the leave is not cumulative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further reflection ought to have cautioned it
that certainly this rule is far from being applicable as on its face it is
based on the aforesaid Section 2187, which as noted is not in point.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, however, to be considered as having pertinence and relevance,
it cannot as an administrative order supplant the plain and explicit statutory
command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why such should be the case is
explained in a recent decision, <span class="SpellE">Teoxon</span> v. Member of
the Board of Administrators.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The recognition of the power
of administrative officials to promulgate rules in the implementation of the
statute, necessarily limited to what is provided for in the legislative
enactment, may be found in the early case of United States v. <span class="SpellE">Barrias</span> decided in 1908.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then came, in a 1914 decision, <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> Molina, a delineation of the scope of such
competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Of course the regulations adopted under
legislative authority by a particular department must be in harmony with the
provisions of the law, and for the sole purpose of carrying into effect its
general provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By such regulations,
of course, the law itself can not be extended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So long, however, as the regulations relate solely to carrying into effect
the provisions of the law, they are valid.' In 1936, in People v. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
this Court expressed its disapproval of an administrative order that would
amount to an excess of the regulatory power vested in an adminis­trative
official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reaffirmed such a doctrine
in a 1951 decision, where we again made clear that where an administrative
order betrays inconsistency or repugnancy to the provisions of the Act, 'the
mandate of the Act must prevail and must be followed.' Justice Barrera,
speaking for the Court in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Company,
Inc. v. Social Security Commission, citing Parker as well as Davis did tersely
sum up the matter thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A rule is
binding on the courts so long as the procedure fixed for its promulgation is
followed and its scope is within the statutory granted by the legislature, even
if the courts are not in agreement with the policy stated therein or its innate
wisdom * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
administrative interpretation of the law is at best merely advisory, for it is
the courts that finally determine what the law means.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The succeeding paragraph in such a decision is likewise in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It cannot be otherwise as the Constitution limits the authority of
the President, in whom all executive power resides, to take care that the laws
be faithfully executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No lesser
administrative executive office or agency then can, contrary to the express
language of the Constitution, assert for itself a more extensive
prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, it is bound to
observe the constitutional mandate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be strict compliance with the legislative enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms must be followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute requires adherence to, not
departure from, its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
deviation is allowable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the terse
language of the present Chief Justice, an administrative agency 'cannot amend
an act of Congress.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing can be clearer
therefore than that the claim of petitioner to a commutation of his vacation
and sick leave not exceeding ten (10) months must be upheld, inasmuch as the
facts show that the total amount sought to be paid to him was precisely in
accordance with the controlling legal provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling now on review must be reversed and
petitioner's plea granted.</p>
