to annul and set aside the resolution of the respondent Commission on
Elections, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for short, numbered RR-704 and
dated May 21, 1970, declaring as "obviously manufactured and should,
therefore, be rejected and not used as basis of the canvass" the election
return for Precinct 20 of <span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>,
for purposes of the election of the Mayor of said municipality in November,
1967; (2) prohibition to enjoin said <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and the

votes for the position of Mayor and, thereafter, to proclaim petitioner as the
duly elected Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Ki­bawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the exercise of its authority underscored in the decision of
this Court in a previous case between the same parties in relation to the
disputed results in the same Precinct 20 aforementioned,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> conducted hearings purported to determine
the genuineness of the copies of the election return for said precinct and came
out with the following legally relevant findings and con­clusions:</p>

<blockquote>"When the Commission examined the copies of the election
return for Pre­cinct 20, <span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>
for the COMELEC, the municipal treasurer, bal­lot box, the provincial treasurer
as well as the advance copy and the copy for the Liberal Party, it found that
the data on voters and the data on ballots were not accomplished and that in
all said copies, except the provin­cial treasurer's copy, VILLALON was credited
with 525 votes in words and figures and SERIÑA 76 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the provincial treasurer's copy, VILLA­LON
got 225 votes and SERIÑA 76 votes although the word 'two' in the words 'Two
Hundred twenty five' appeared to be retraced and that the letters '<span class="SpellE">wo</span>' were written with a sharper pencil and were of darker
shade than the first letter which appeared either as a ‘t’ or an 'f'."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After examining all copies of the returns submitted to the
Commission (COMELEC, municipal treasurer, ballot box, provincial treasurer,
Liberal Party and advance copy), the Commis­sion has reached the conclusion
that the returns as prepared by the board of inspectors before they were tam­pered
by third persons credited VILLALON with 525 votes in words and figures, SERIÑA
with 76 votes, <span class="SpellE">Inghog</span> with 41 votes and <span class="SpellE">Sunico</span> with zero votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provincial treasurer's copy was tam­pered by a person other than a
member of the board of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
COME­LEC copy which actually is the origi­nal of the seven copies is a clean
copy although it is obvious that par­ticularly with respect to the candi­dates
for the office of mayor the names of the candidates were written with a
different kind of pencil than that with which the votes received by the
candidates in words and figures were written, a fact which suggests the
possibility that the votes of the candidates for mayor in words and figures were
written by a different person at a time other than when the names of the
candidates were written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The municipal
treasurer's copy and the copy for the ballot box appeared to be the duplicates
of the COMELEC copy, that is to say, that the names of the candidates for the
office of mayor and the votes received by them in words and figures were
written with the same strokes as those which wrote on the COMELEC copy and on
the same occasion. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>While the same is
also true with respect to the provincial treasurer's copy an attempt was made
subsequently by a third party to alter the votes of VILLALON from 525 to 225,
the reduction of <span class="SpellE">VILLALON's</span> votes by 300 being
critical and decisive because it would reverse the result of the election in
favor of candidate SERIÑA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"COMELEC copy which is a clean copy confirms the entries in
the municipal copy which appeared to be merely a dup­licate of the COMELEC copy
and, there­fore, for purposes of canvassing of the results of the election for
the office of mayor of <span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span>, the municipal
treasurer’s copy would ordinarily be the one to be used as the basis of the
canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Commission is
constrained to reject the municipal treasurer's copy and the COMELEC and the
ballot box copies on the ground that they are obviously manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission also re­jects the provincial
treasurer's copy because the same had been tampered with insofar as the
candidates for the office of mayor are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons for our finding that the returns
as prepared by the board of inspectors; namely, the COMELEC, the municipal
treasurer, ballot box copy and the provincial treasurer's copy before it was
altered are as fol­lows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Commission notes that with ex­ception of VILLALON, none
of the candi­dates in the 1967 election received more than 315 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Senator, the highest number of votes
received was 266 by Loren­zo <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>; for
Vice-Governor, 303 by Ange­lo Lopez; for Provincial Board Member, 285 by <span class="SpellE">Rodano</span> <span class="SpellE">Anjudal</span>; for Vice-Mayor,
276 votes; and for Councilor, 272 <span class="SpellE">Inura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bitakura</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The four <span class="SpellE">governatorial</span> candidates
received a total of 367 votes; the four vice-<span class="SpellE">governatorial</span>
candidates received 359 votes while the four vice mayoralty candidates received
a total of 361 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be thus
noted that for these po­sitions of Provincial Governor, Vice-Governor and
Vice-Mayor, not more than 367 voters voted."</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Statistical probabilities based on common experience are that the candidates
for Governor, Vice-Governor, Mayor and Vice-Mayor of the same party would be
receiving almost the same num­ber of votes and any variation in their votes
would not be very much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">pro­balities</span> would be more true in Precinct 20 which showed
senatorial candidates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party
receiving votes as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TEVES, 266;
ROY, 265; BENI­TEZ, 262; PEREZ, 257; PELAEZ, 256; LAU­REL, 252; ESPINA, 240;
and VELOSO, 199.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">topnotcher</span>
among the Liberal candidates was BENIGNO AQUINO with 85 votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So even granting that this precinct is a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> bailiwick, even without referring to the
Minutes of Voting, the 525 votes given to VILLALON would be statistically
improbable."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> To
clarify, the finding of the Commission that the returns for Precinct 20 were
obviously manufactured and statistically improbable is based primarily on the
fact that with except­ion of VILLALON, none of the candidates in the 1967
election received more than 315 votes; that the total number of votes for the
office of Provincial Go­vernor, Vice-Governor and Vice-Mayor are only 367, 359
and 361, respectively; that the minutes of the voting showed that only 419
official ballots were used and 550 ballots were received in the precinct; and
that the tally sheet showed that VILLALON got very much less than 525
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these facts and circumstances
in the <u>taut</u> <u>ensemble</u> in­disputably establish the falsity of the
return insofar as the number of votes of VILLALON of 525 votes in Precinct 20, <span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span>, is concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Its other findings and conclusion are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Thus the omission of the data on voters and the data on
ballots in the return becomes meaningful and so is the conduct of the chairman
of the board of inspectors in systematically avoiding service of subpoena to
appear before the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
omission by the board of inspectors to fill the data on voters and the data on
ballots was evi­dently deliberate and made with the ob­jective in mind of
making it possible for said board to give VILLALON a num­ber of votes greatly
in excess of the number of official ballots used in the precinct without being
discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the returns now show, the
total number of votes credited by the board of in­spectors to the four
candidates which is 642 exceeds by 98 the number of bal­lots received in the
precinct and by 223 number of ballots used.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This dis­crepancy the Commission believe to be excessive and for this
reason the Commission is constrained in the interest of clean elections to rule
that munici­pal treasurer's copy, COMELEC copy and the ballot box copy of the
returns are falsified or obviously manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the clean copies of the returns as
prepared by the board of inspectors, namely, municipal treasurer's copy,
COMELEC copy and ballot box copy, are obviously manufactured and should therefore
be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, the alteration
or tampering that was made on the provincial treasurer's copy was an attempt by
the adherents of the opponents of VILLALON to counteract the ma­nufacturing of
the return made by the board of inspectors in favor of VILLA­LON.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Similarly, the fact noted earlier that the votes in words and
figures of the candidates for mayor were written by another person with lead
pencil on an occasion different than when the names of the candidates for mayor
were written with indelible pencil becomes very suspicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said fact tend to in­dicate that after the
names of the can­didates for mayors were written down, the votes of the
candidates were deli­berately withheld and not entered in the return and that
it was only after the result from other precincts were reported that the votes
of said candi­dates were written and VILLALON was given just enough number of
votes to assure him at least the proclamation as the winning candidate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issue for Our resolution in the pre­sent case is
whether or not on the basis of the findings and conclusions of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> first above-quoted, ex­cluding those in the
quotations immediately preceding this paragraph, this Court can hold that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> gravely abused its discretion or
acted in excess of jurisdiction in holding that the return here in ques­tion is
an obviously manufactured one and consequently ordering that the same be not
considered in the canvass of the votes for the herein contested position of
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Kibawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
L-28598, March 12, 1968, 22 SCRA 978, is clear authority for the rule that in
any case where it is alleged that an election return is statistically
improbable and, therefore, obviously manufactured, the case must rise or fall
on the basis of inferences that may be drawn, in the light of com­mon
experience, exclusively from the data found on the face of the return and
evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> may not be considered in this
regard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts of that case were:</p>

<blockquote>"The election return of Precinct 2 is blank with respect to
the data on the number of voters who register­ed and number of voters who
actually voted, as well as on the data on the number of ballots received by the
Board of Inspectors and the number of ballots used in the voting, al­though,
the plebiscite return of Pre­cinct 2 prepared by the same Board of Inspectors
states that the number of voters who registered is 375 and the same number of
voters voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of 375 as the
number of vo­ters registered in the precinct, there are still more votes
credited to candidates for mayor, because, as stated in the decision of the
Commis­sion of January 3, 1968 a total of 389 votes were credited for all the
candidates for mayor or an excess of 14 votes over the number of voters
registered, assuming that all said voters voted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is one more patent fact appearing on the face of said
elec­tion return of Precinct 2 which shows that this election return is
obviously manufactured, namely, the votes for senators as they are hereunder
repro­duced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As shown above, five senatorial candi­dates
received exactly the same votes of 375 each.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is more, three of these candidates, namely -- <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>
and Rodrigo are Liberals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more con­vincing
proof than this could be pro­duced to prove that this election re­turn is
manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is indeed
statistically improbable that the al­leged 375 registered voters, claimed to
have all voted, should one and all equally and in the same manner vote for
three <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidates and two Liberal
candidates for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is contrary
to all records and expe­rience in elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then, there are nine candidates, including <span class="SpellE">Asaas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Usman</span>, who received votes ranging from 300 to 375, or
a total number of votes credited for these nine candidates of 3,265.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the maximum total number of votes that
could be cast by the 375 voters, assuming that all of them voted and that each
of them cast his vote for eight candidates for senators, will be only 3,000
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But here, the total number of
votes credited for the aforesaid nine candidates for sena­tor is 3,265, thereby
producing an ex­cess of 265 votes credited for senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing facts appearing on the face of
said election return itself show that the election return is ob­viously
manufactured."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and upon these facts We ruled thus:</p>

<blockquote>"What we said in <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> v.
Commission on Elections is here applicable with equal propriety and vigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The return in this case shows nothing on its
face from which the canvassers might conclude that it does not speak the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only when it is compared with the certification
of the election registrar, or with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> record
of the number of bal­lots issued to precinct 2, or with plebiscite return that
a discrepancy appears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
the defect is not apparent and therefore the re­turn is by no means 'obviously
manufactured' - if 'manufactured' it is - so as to justify its exclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to belittle the claim that more
votes were cast than there were voters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps that is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The point
sim­ply is that this question should be threshed out in an election protest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court has heretofore held that a canvassing board may
apply to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for authority to use ano­ther
copy of an election return where the one before it is falsified or where it is
so incomplete that the number of votes cast for each candidate cannot be
determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But here the problem is not
that posed by a return that does not speak the truth but, possibly, if we are
to believe <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span>, that presented by ballots
which have been fraudulently dropped in the ballot box and there commingled
with the genuine ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all that we
know a count of the ballots will confirm the statement in the return that 366
votes were act­ually cast for <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> in precinct
2, in which even the integrity of the return will have been established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the 366 votes were cast through fraud
and other irregularities, as both <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span> and <span class="SpellE">Comell</span> claim and as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
found, is altogether a differ­ent matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That question would re­quire proof and, necessarily, time, which the
need for the prompt procla­mation of elected officials would not permit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, to reject the return, as <span class="SpellE">Mangondato</span> urges, would be to disfranchise voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears strong emphasis to state here that
canvassing boards must exercise 'extreme caution' in rejecting returns and then
may do so only when the re­turns are palpably irregular."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portions of the decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, L-28396,
December 29, 1967, 21 SCRA 1467, referred to in <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>
read:</p>

<blockquote>"First, a canvassing board per­forms a purely ministerial
function - that of compiling and adding the results as they appear in the
returns transmitted to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
teach­ing in <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party v. Commission on
Elections:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(85 Phil., 149,
157-158[1949]) 'the canvassers are to be satisfied of the genuineness of the
returns - namely, that the papers presented to them are not forged and spu­rious,
that they are returns, and that they are signed by the proper officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When so satisfied ….. they may not reject any
returns because of informa­lities in them or because of illegal and fraudulent
practices in the elec­tions' (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>,
at 157-158).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they cannot pass upon
the validity of an election return, much less exclude it from the canvass on
the ground that the votes cast in the precinct from whence it came are
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Abendante</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Relato</span>, 94 Phil. 8 [1953]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But the exclusion of the return in this case is sought to be
justified on the ground that it is 'obviously manufactured' because, contrary
to the statement therein that there were 195 registered voters, of whom 188
voted, the certificate of the local election registrar states that only 182
voters had registered on October 30, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span><u> v. Commission on Elections</u>
(L-25444, January 31, 1966) is cited in support of this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span>,
the returns were palpably false as it was indeed statistically improbable that
'<u>all the eight</u> candidates of one party garnered <u>all the votes each</u>
of them <u>received exactly the same number</u>, whereas all the eight
candidates of the other party got precisely <u>nothing</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the aid of evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> was not needed, as 'the fraud (being) so
palpable from the return itself (<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ipsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>loquitor</u></span> - the
thing speaks for itself), there is no reason to accept it and give it prima
facie value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the return in this case shows nothing on
its face from which the canvassers might con­clude that it does not speak the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only when it is compared
with the certificate of the election regis­trar that a discrepancy appears as
to the number of registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
return therefore is by no means 'ob­viously manufactured' so as to justify its
exclusion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The so-called <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> doctrine of
statistical im­probability relied upon by respondents has never been followed
in any subsequent case except <span class="SpellE">Sinsuat</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>, et al., L-31501, June 30, 1970, wherein by a vote
of 7-3, this Court ruled that the factual basis of 100% pattern of voting in
the precincts therein in question was on all fours with that in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the
opinion to the contrary of the writer hereof, joined by Justices Castro and <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, that decision is the subject of a motion for reconsider­ation
and is not yet final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, <span class="SpellE">Sinsuat</span> is not a case of alleged excess votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in said case, this Court overruled
the portions of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> resolution applying the
doctrine of statistical improbability to the returns in a number of precincts
which showed votes in excess of the number of registered voters or of voters
who voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in all cases of
alleged excess votes, particularly <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span>, We have consistently held that the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> ruling should not be unduly expanded beyond its
precise factual setting.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In Estrada vs. Navarro, G. R. No. L-28374, December 29, 1967, We went as far as
to resort to the minutes of voting, a document outside of the return, in order
to explain away an alleged case of excess votes, because 'a conclusion that an
election return is obviously manufactured or false and consequently should be
disregarded in the canvass must be approach­ed with extreme caution, and only
upon the most con­vincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case speaks of 'inherent
improbability' in the data shown on the return.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any plausible explanation, one which is acceptable to a reasonable man
in the light of ex­perience and of the probabilities of the situation, should
suffice to avoid outright nullification, with the resulting disenfranchisement
of those who exer­cised their right of suffrage."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents argue, however, that precisely, this Estrada case
supports their position that evi­dence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>
may be taken into account in cases of this nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention is not entirely correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in said case, We took into
account evidence outside of the return, consisting of the mi­nutes of voting,
but this was done for the purpose of showing that the factual presumption of
statistical improbability did not hold, there being an explana­tion borne by an
election document related closely to the return and prepared contemporaneously
therewith of the alleged excess of votes seemingly deducible from data found on
the face of the return, and not to serve as basis or evidence of the alleged
statistical improbability, for as already stated, never have We ever allowed
evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> for the latter purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, as the rule of Our
jurisprudence now stands, a conclusion of statistical improbability may be
drawn only from what appears on the face of a return, but evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> may be admitted to over­come the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is why We cannot consider the findings
and observations of respondent COMELEC quot­ed earlier which do not refer to
matters appearing within the four corners of the return, the same be­ing
incompetent, even if somehow relevant, for the purpose for which it is
intended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
it­self admits it cannot be done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
resolution under appeal, it observed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This, of course, is merely theorizing and should not be understood
that the conclusions and findings of the Commission are in any way, based
thereon."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents further invite attention to their allegation that the
supposed excess votes here number around two hundred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>in <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span>, the apparent ex­cess was two
hundred sixty-five votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is
that even if, mathematically, it appears that there is an excess, there is
still no way of determining deci­sively on the face of the return the exact
number of ballots actually cast, which is what is controlling, for, as a matter
of actual fact, more ballots may have been really cast and if, in violation of
Section 145 of the Revised Election Code prescribing the procedure for
separating excess ballots and prescribing thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 145.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Excess
ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Before proceeding to count
the votes the board of inspectors shall count the ballots in the box for valid
ballots without un­folding them or exposing their contents, except so far as to
ascertain that each ballot is single, and shall compare the number of ballots
in the box with the number of voters who have voted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there are excess ballots they shall be
replaced in the box and thoroughly mingled therein; and one of the inspectors
designated by the board, without seeing the ballots and with his back to the
box, shall publicly draw out as many ballots as may be equal to such excess
and, with­out unfolding them, place them in a pac­kage which shall be marked
'EXCESS BALLOTS' and which shall be sealed and signed by the members of the
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The package shall be placed in
the box for valid votes, but its contents shall not be read in the counting of
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, in the course of the
examination, any ballots shall be found folded together before they were
deposited in the box, they shall be placed in the package for excess
ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In case ballots with their
detachable numbers be found in the box, such numbers shall be removed and
deposited in the box for spoiled ballots, and, if ballots with the words
'spoiled' be found in the box, such ballot shall likewise be placed in the box
for spoiled ballots."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the board of inspectors count them
nevertheless without separating the excess, it does not lie in the hands of the
canvassers to make any correction; they must read the return as is; the
corresponding courts and tribu­nal can take care of the rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to sanc­tion an irregularity; We
are just reconciling the pos­sibility of error either in counting the ballots
or in noting their right number, which boards of inspectors are not far from
committing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of regu­larity
ordained by law must be used in reference to all the data appearing in the
return, so that in case of con­flict between any of them, one or the other must
be con­ceded to be the result of honest error, unless the con­trary conclusion
is strongly and convincingly evident.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Tagoranao</span> as here, the spaces for
the data on the number of registered voters in the precinct, the number of
voters who voted and the number of ballots received were left blank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How is one to know how many actually voted?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if there were any figures in said
spaces, still We would not say there is "most convin­cing proof" of
excess votes which would authorize the conclusion that the pertinent return is
"obviously manufactured", "utterly improbable and clearly
incredible" and should be disregarded in the canvass, thereby re­sulting
in the elimination from the count of the honest votes cast therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even conceding that there are such excess
votes, the function of separating the honest ones from the dishonest does not
devolve upon the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, as that would necessarily
involve a determination of the right to vote which is expressly excluded by the
Consti­tution from <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> jurisdiction, and much
less upon the boards of inspectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
authority belongs ex­clusively to the electoral tribunals or to the courts, in
respect to local elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">We might just as well clarify here that in the matter of alleged
excess votes, the precedent is not exactly <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much less <span class="SpellE">Sinsuat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> dealt
exclusively with 100% pattern of voting with complete blanking out of the
opposing party, not excess votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first reference to excess votes as a factor in de­termining the genuineness of
election returns was made in this jurisdiction in the earlier case of <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
85 Phil. 149, wherein 18 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. was cited, and, in
turn, this cited State ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>. Mitchell vs. Stevens,
33 Am. Rep. 175 in which the factual back­ground was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This is an action of <i style="">mandamus</i>,
to compel the defendants, as canvassing board of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>county</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Harper</st1:placename></st1:place>, to canvass and declare
the result of they election held in November last for county officers, and on
the question of the location of the county seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants, for one ground of de­fense,
return that there were only about 800 legal voters in said coun­ty at the date
of said election, whereas the returns as made show a vote of 2,947 purporting
to have been polled, and that therefore at least 2,147 of such votes were fraud­ulent
and illegal, and that by reason thereof it is impossible to de­termine and declare
the will of the people or the true result of such election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion has been made to strike out this
portion of the return, and upon that motion the case is sub­mitted to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion is made in no technical spirit,
but as counsel agree, that there may be a speedy de­termination of the
substantial ques­tions involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we
meet counsel in the same spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
general knowledge of matters and events assures us that in an outlying and
frontier coun­ty like Harper, there is no such num­ber of legal voters, and
hence that the return of the commissioners that the large majority of such
apparent vote is illegal and fraudulent is sub­stantially correct."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and the Supreme Court of Kansas, thru Mr.
Justice Brewer held:</p>

<blockquote>"The question therefore presented is not whether, when there
have been, or are charged to have been, here and there, illegal votes received,
or le­gal votes rejected, or fraudulent or irregular practices on the part of
the officers in any one or more voting precincts, the county board has a right
to inquire into the merits of such votes, or the conduct of such officers, but
whether, when there are sent in to the canvassing board returns showing such an
enormous number of votes as to be perfectly obvious that they are not true
returns of legal votes actually cast,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>but simply manufactured evidences of an attempt to defeat the popular
will, this court will, by <i style="">mandamus</i>,
compel the board to accept as true these fraudulent returns and canvass, and
declare the result as though they even <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showed the
actual vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for <span class="SpellE">relator</span> rely upon the case of <u>Lewis v. Commissioners</u>,
16 Kans. 102, in which this court decided that the duty of a canvassing board
is substantially ministerial, and that it is not to reject returns regular in
form and genuine, on the ground that illegal votes were received, or other
frauds practiced at the elect­ion; that such matters are to be in­quired into
by a tribunal for contest­ing elections, or in <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
pro­ceedings; while the defendants rely on the case of <u>State v. <span class="SpellE">Marston</span></u> 6 Kans. 524, in which this court, after a
canvass had been made, refused to compel, by <i style="">mandamus</i>, the commissioners to move their records and keep their
office at the place declared by the canvass to be the chosen county seat, on
the ground that just such an out­rage as appears in this case had been
committed in the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
clearly of the opinion that the principle of the latter case must control
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was said in that case, as it
has been said in others, that 'the writ of <i style="">mandamus</i>
lies, to a great ex­tent, within the discretion of the court where the
application is made.' Now, while canvassing is a ministerial duty, yet it would
be a singular exer­cise of its discretion for a court whose duty it is to
uphold purity, justice, and honest dealing, to give even appar­ent sanction to
such an outrage so gross and so manifest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A canvass is a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> recognition of the truth of the
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compelling a canvass is
compelling a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> recognition of these returns as true
statements of the votes cast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these
returns are manifestly rotten and worthless, and the truth is not in them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not fail of absolute truth through
mere mis­take or error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are an
intentional and immense lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
without values in any proceeding or in any court, as evidence of votes cast,
for while legal and honest votes were cast, yet no court is under obligation to
attempt to sift the grain of truth from the mass of falsehood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is urged that indivi­duals were candidates
for office at this election, and that unless a canvass be made there is no way
of determining who is elected, and the incumbents thus continue to hold offices
which they are not entitled to hold, and for which the people have chosen other
persons; that these candidates may be in no manner implicated in the wrong, and
hence they should not be deprived of the emoluments of the offices to which
they are elected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There may be a
hardship in this, but if the returns are not true, how will they show who is
elected?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a party can base his right
to an office upon nothing other than that which is so manifestly untrue, he can
hardly ever expect to ob­tain or hold it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it be said that this wrong may only have occurred in the returns from
certain precincts, and that the others should have been canvassed, we reply
that no such question is here presented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The answer presents the mat­ter as a whole, and as though the wrong was
universal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps if they are re­turns
from any precincts not deserving of this condemnation, they should be can­vassed,
and the result both as to officers and county seat declared <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per­haps on the basis of such <span class="SpellE">unimpeached</span> returns the various successful candidates may
by direct proceeding establish their right to office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be time enough to consider those
questions when properly before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
we now decide is, that at no stage of the proceedings will this court lend its
sanction to an outrage so gross and flagrant as that disclosed by the ans­wer,
and never by <i style="">mandamus</i> compel any other
tribunal to accept and recognize as true that which is so manifestly a
deliberate and prepared lie."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Excess votes then is not a matter of statistical improbability;
it is plain mathematical impossibility, if all the relevant facts are extant in
the return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the decisive
point is the number of alleged excess votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As can be seen above, in the Mitchell case, which was the basis of the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> decision, the proportion of the excess votes to
the maximum of votes actually possible was more than 8 to 21 or 2 to 5, and, in
exact figures, the excess was at least 2,147 over only 800 possible legal
votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on this ma­thematical
basis that the court drew the conclusion that the returns were "manifestly
rotten and worthless, and the truth is not in them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not fail of ab­solute truth through
mere mistake or error." The test, We may say, is whether the number of
excess votes is within the margin of possible error or mistake, which, cannot
be so categorized if not honest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that the number of votes which appear to have been credited to petitioner of
525 is unusually big compared with the highest number of votes among all the
other candidates in said precinct in the 1967 elections of 315, even if added
to the other fact that the total of the votes for all the candidates; for
Governor and Vice-Governor were only 367 and 359, respectively, do not, to Our
mind, sufficiently exclude the possibility of error in any of such
entries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is worse for private
respondent, if he take into account what appears in the tally sheet, the
original of which has been submitted to this Court by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
the logical conclusion would be that the entry of petitioner's votes in the
return must have been based on this tally sheet, there being no clear and
indubitable evidence that the said tally sheet has been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully examined the said original
tally sheet and while some of the points raised by respondents in connection
therewith may be quite well taken, We are not ready to hold that they are as
clear and convincing as would justify Us to con­clude, at this stage of this
electoral controversy, that the return has lost its quality of being <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the
electoral protest alone that this matter may be definitely and appropriately
resolved.</p>
