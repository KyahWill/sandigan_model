71174 of the Court of First Instance of Manila the bond put up by the <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., for the
provisional liberty of the accused was ordered confiscated, and from that order
the bondsman ap­pealed directly to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The bond was in the
amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, posted for Manuel <span class="SpellE">Castillejos</span> y <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, who had
been charged with the crime of robbery, but was convicted only of the crime of
slight physical injuries and given a 20-day sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment, dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="8"><span style="">August 9,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, was scheduled
for promulgation </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the following August
16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused failed to appear,
whereupon the court issued the following order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For failure of the accused to appear for the promulgation of the
de­cision this morning, notwithstanding due notice, the Court hereby orders the
confiscation of the bond filed for his provisional liberty and the <span class="SpellE">Con­solacion</span> Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. is hereby
given thirty (30) days from no­tice hereof within which to show cause why
judgment should not be rendered against said bond."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted order was received by the bondsman on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1963</st1:date> and before the expira­tion of the 30-day period allowed,
the bondsman moved to re­consider, erroneously alleging as ground that
"the accused had already been previously sentenced on <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1963</st1:date>..." The court a quo denied the
motion in its order of <st1:date year="1963" day="5" month="9">September 5,
 1963</st1:date>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting upon the motion for recon­sideration filed by the <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> In­surance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., bondsmen for
the accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Castillejos</span> y <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>,
and considering that the said bondsmen do not even know what transpired on
August 16, 1963 when the Court ordered the con­fiscation of their bond, the
Court finds the motion not to be well-founded and so hereby denies the
same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A second motion for
reconsideration was filed on September 16, 1963, this time alleging:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the failure of the principal to
appear before the Court on August 16, 1963 was due to his confinement on that
date in the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Provincial Hospital, as shown by a
certification by the Medical Records Librarian of the hospital, and (2) that
subsequently, within the 30-day period given by the court, the accused per­sonally
appeared before it, submitted himself to the judgment rendered against him and
started to serve his sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
same day the motion was filed the court issued the following order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For lack of merits, motion for reconsi­deration of Court
order is hereby denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment is
hereby rendered against the bondsmen for the whole amount of the bond."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first issue raised by
appellant involves the in­terpretation of Section 15 of Rule 114, which
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 15.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Forfeiture of bail.</span>
- When the appearance of the defendant is required by the court, his sureties
shall be notified to produce him before the court on a given date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the defendant fails to appear as required,
the bond is declared forfeited and the bondsmen are given thirty (30) days with­in
which to produce their principal and to show cause why a judgment should not be
ren­dered against them for the amount of their bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the said period of thirty (30) days,
the bondsmen <span style="">(a) </span>must produce
the body of their principal or give the reason for its non-production; and (b)
must explain satis­factorily why the defendant did not appear before the court
when first required so to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing in
these two requisites, a judgment shall be rendered against the bonds­men.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant submits that the lower court abused its discretion in
rendering judgment on the bond before the expiration of the 30-day period
granted in the above-quoted provision of the Rules <span style="">as </span>well as in the order of confis­cation itself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's contention is
untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In People
vs. Del Carmen, et al., G. R. No.</span> L-22082, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="10"><span style="">October 30, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, we held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">All</span> that is required before judgment upon the bond may be
rendered is the performance by the bondsman of two (2) specific acts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) produce the body of the principal or give
the reason for his non-production; and (2) explain satisfactorily why the
principal did not appear before the court when first required to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose a period of thirty days is
allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If upon the expiration thereof
neither of the requisites is complied with, judg­ment against the bondsman
shall be rendered as a matter of course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>This however does not mean that </u><u><span style="">if the </span>prin</u><u><span style="">cipal is produced before the period ex­pires
and the explanation is submitted for his non-appearance when required the court
will have to wait until the expiration of such period before it may render
judgment on the bond</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>There is no point at all in deferring
judgment since the matter is already submitted to the court on the only
question of whether or not the explanation is satisfactory and whether or not
the bondsman should be held liable</u>." (<span class="GramE">underlining</span>
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
above ruling was reiterated in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabanero</span>,
et al., G. R. No. L-22081, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January 17, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The next issue refers to
the merit of the explanation given by appellant, embodied in its second motion
for reconsideration, for the failure of its principal to appear on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">date set for the promulgation of the sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an issue the resolution of which
generally lies within the discretion of the trial court (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Alamada</span>, 89 Phil. 1; People vs. Del Carmen, et </span><span style="">al., </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court found that
the explanation submitted by appellant was not entirely satisfactory, and we
see no justifiable reason to reverse its finding, particularly because the
explanation was a belated one, and should have been brought to the attention of
the court on the very day the accused was required to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since it is undisputed that he was
then actually confined in a hospital, and considering the fact that while he
was charged with robbery, a grave offense, he was convicted only of slight
physical injuries and given 20-day sentence, we are of the opinion that the
liability of the bondsman should be reduced to a more or less nominal sum,
which is hereby fixed at P200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
order appealed from is modified accordingly, without pro­nouncement as to
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
