				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) is
appealing from two orders of the Public Service Commission (in PSC Cases Nos.
61-5270, 61-5271, 61-5280, 61-2111 &amp; 62-4169):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) dated 13 August 1964, directing it to
complete by 25 August 1964 the repair of all telephone troubles in Manila and
suburbs caused by typhoon "<span class="SpellE">Dading</span>", or by
other factors, and to repair, within five days after they were reported, all
other telephone troubles that may arise after <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="8">20 August 1964</st1:date>, with provision for the imposition <span style="">of </span>a daily fine of P50.00 in case of
failure to comply with any of the aforesaid directives; and (2) dated <st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2">3 February 1965</st1:date>, denying PLDT’S motion
for reconsideration of the first order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the numerous complaints received by the Public
Service Commission from telephone subscribers in Manila and suburbs, about the
alleged inadequate, inefficient and unsatisfactory service and discriminatory
practices of the PLDT in the repair of telephones rendered out of order by
typhoon “<span class="SpellE">Dading</span>”, the PLDT was cited to appear before
the Commission on 21 July 1964 to explain why disciplinary action shoed not be
taken against it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the hearing, it
was established that on account of this typhoon that hit </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> on 29 and </span><st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="6"><span style="">30 June 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> the various public utility services
sustained extensive damage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
while the light and water services had been restored to almost normal
condition, a great number of telephones remained unusable even a month after
the calamity was over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PLDT, through
its witnesses, attempted to justify the delay in its repair-jobs by urging the
extent of damage wrought by the typhoon to its facilities;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the difficulties being encountered in the
repair-work;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the shortage of trained men to do the
technical phase of the work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For their part, the
complainants offered </span>the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Severo</span>
Santiago, President of Republic Telephone Company, to rebut the declarations of
the <span style="">PLDT witnesses that the delay in
the complete restoration of telephone outages could not be helped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="8"><span style="">13
 August 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Public Service Commission ordered the PLDT to complete the repair of telephones
still not functioning, in this tenor:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the PSC <span style="">hereby
grants the </span>PLDT up to <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="8">August
 25, 1964</st1:date> to complete the repairs of all telephone troubles in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and suburbs which may be out-­of-order as a result of typhoon <span class="SpellE">Dading</span> or for any other cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="8">August
 25, 1964</st1:date>, PLDT will pay a fine of Fifty Pesos (P50.00) per day, <span style="">for any telephone trouble</span> <span style="">or troubles existing prior </span>to <st1:date year="1964" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1964</st1:date> and remaining <span class="SpellE">unrepaired</span> until such repair is completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for other telephone troubles arising and
reported to PLDT after said date, said COMPANY is required to effect the
necessary repairs within five (5) days, from the date of such report, and in
case of failure to do so, PLDT will pay the same penalty of P50.00 per day,
until such repair is completed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The directive was based on the
Commission's findings that -</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence of the PLDT consisting of numerous plans,
charts, sample cables, lead, etc. tend to estab­lish that the damage caused by
typhoon <span class="SpellE">Dading</span> on <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1964</st1:date> was too extensive and that PLDT did not have
enough trained <span class="SpellE">splicers</span> and trained technical men to
complete the work at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
explanation is not altogether sufficient or satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we realize the predicament of PLDT, it
is our considered opinion that the much needed repairs could have been
completed by this time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, when this incident was called for hearing on <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1964</st1:date>, PLDT informed the Commission that
about eighty per cent of the work needed was already finished, and PLDT
expected to finish all the repairs on the early part of August, not beyond <st1:date year="1964" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so, that the Commission suggested
(to) the parties that a stipulation to that effect be submitted but the
stipulation was not formally carried out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if eighty per cent of the work was finished before July 21, 1964
when this incident was first called for hearing as affirmed by PLDT, there is
no reason at all, why the remaining twenty percent was not finished up to
August 5, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Severo</span>
Santiago, a consulting telephone engineer since 1954, and presently the
President of Republic Telephone Company, who testified as an expert witness in
this case, maintained that in his opinion the damages caused by the typhoon to
PLDT could have been repaired in thirty (30) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Santiago, explained that in the absence
of sufficient technical and trained or skilled workers, PLDT should have sought
the cooperation of other telephone systems, either directly or thru the intervention
of the PSC or other agencies of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Telecom, the Army, the Republic Telephone Company, and many other
public utilities would have been too glad to extend their cooperation and to
establish a system of mutual help, for the benefit of all, and particularly for
the advantage of the general public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the PLDT was able to finish 80% of the work, up to <st1:date year="1964" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1964</st1:date> without assistance from anyone, had
the PLDT solicited the help and cooperation of other utilities, instead of 80%
the entire damage could have been repaired, at a very much earlier date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to PLDT, at present there are only 1,360 cable
troubles representing same number of telephones (except where there are party
lines), remain­ing <span class="SpellE">unrepaired</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said cable troubles should be repaired and
finished without any unnecessary delay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commission is willing to be liberal with the PLDT provided all
repairs are fully completed on or before <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1964</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Against this order, the
PLDT filed a 23-page motion for reconsideration, adducing therein its grounds
and reasons in support of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion was set for hearing on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="9"><span style="">1 September 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">; then, at the instance of <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">was moved to </span><st1:date year="1964" day="4" month="9"><span style="">4 September 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this latter date, however, the Com­mission was not able to hear the motion, for
lack of the necessary quorum (page 5, Petitioner's brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="2"><span style="">3 February 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, an order was issued in the cases, signed by
six members of the Commission, denying <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span> motion
for reconsideration for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The PLDT then filed the present petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner PLDT assigns
as first error allegedly committed by the respondent Public Service Commission
the denial of its motion for reconsideration before it could be heard by that
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is <span style="">claimed that, pursuant to Section 3 of the
Public Service Act, as amended by Republic Act 2677, a hearing <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
of a motion for reconsideration of an order or decision of the Commission is
mandatory, non-observance of which constitutes reversible error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not agree to the
proposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be true that the
Public Service Act provides for the hearing of a motion for reconsideration,
with proper notice to the parties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> However, the strict observance of this
provision in these cases is not now imperative, particularly in view of the
proliferation of cases before the Commission since Commonwealth Act No. 146
became effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out
that the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner PLDT consists of 23
pages, containing </span>a <span style="">complete </span>discussion
of <span style="">the grounds, both legal and factual,
in support of its stand that the Commission's order of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="23" month="8"><span style="">23
 August 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> was
incorrect and deserved reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
<span style="">quoted portions of the transcript of
stenographic notes of the testimonies of the witnesses, as well as exhibits
presented during the hearing, which were all available to the members of the
Commission for verification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short,
the motion adequately informed the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the
issues and </span>arguments that petitioner wanted to be taken up and <span style="">considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the circumstances, therefore, even assuming that the resolution of
the motion without prior oral argument thereon was not in strict compliance
with the procedure prescribed by law, the same can not be deemed to have
deprived petitioner of his right to due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is no pretense that had
petitioner's motion been heard additional proof or argument would be presented
that could have affected or changed the conclusion reached by the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be for the same
reason, i.e., absence of material </span>prejudice to the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>,
that in one case<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, although recognizing as irregular the rendition of a ruling by the
Public Service Commission even before the period granted to the parties within
which to file their res­pective memoranda had elapsed, refused to reverse the same,
considering such irregularity insufficient to warrant a reversal or
modification of the aforesaid decision, although a strict observance of
procedural rules is eminently desirable, if only to forestall speculations
generally derogatory to the Commission's reputation (cf. Corrales vs. Gonzalez,
L-29502, <span class="SpellE">Resol</span>. on Motion to Reconsider, 5 December
1968).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additional argument against the
stand of the petitioner is supplied by the fact that the Public Service
Commission, as an ad­ministrative body exercising quasi-judicial powers, is not
strictly bound by procedural rules; of course, provided that no cardinal
primary rights to which an individual is entitled are sacrificed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
None have been denied in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner next contests
the findings </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">fact made by the hearing Commissioner,
alleging that they are not supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is further in­sinuation of
arbitrariness on the part of the hearing Commissioner, in that peti­tioner was
supposedly prevented from proving its defense that everything possible was done
by the telephone company to repair the damage to its facilities at a much
shorter time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to the allegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission's conclusion, that all of the
24,000 telephones affected by the cable troubles caused by the typhoon <span style="">of </span>29 and <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="6">30 June 1964</st1:date> could have been repaired much
earlier than <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="8">25 August 1964</st1:date>,
is not without basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner's
own witness declared that as of 4 August 1964, about 85 to 90% of the
repair-work had already been accomplished, with only some 92 smaller cables
remaining <span class="SpellE">unrepaired</span>;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that as of 7 August 1964, only 4 cables with trouble and affecting 107
telephones had to be worked on.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Since, according to this same witness, there were 175 crews or 645 men detailed
on the job,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
rendering service daily including Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the order of the Commission to finish the repair of the damage caused by the
typhoon by <st1:date year="1964" day="25" month="8">25 August 1964</st1:date>
is reasonable and justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
remains that as between 21 July and 25 August no effort appear to have been
exerted to enlist available outside technical help in order to relieve promptly
the inconvenience to petitioner'<span style="">s </span>subscribers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That the hearing
Commissioner was recorded to have uttered remarks in­dicating impatience with the
slow-pace in which petitioner's evidence was being presented does not
necessarily show unfairness and arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the con­trary, throughout the 265 pages of the transcript covered by
the testimonies of petitioner's expert witnesses, the effort is apparent on the
part of the Com</span>missioner to appreciate the details of the damage
suffered by the tele­phone company and of the measures being adopted to
accomplish quick restoration of the system to normalcy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, assuming that peti­tioner had other
evidence to present but was not allowed to do so, the rule is that the party
prejudiced by the court's action, if he desires to make it the subject of
appeal, should state of record the particular facts he expects to prove by such
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, no review of such
er­roneous action can be had in this Court (<span class="SpellE">Moreta</span>
vs. Tan <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, 57 Phil. 432).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the rule is obvious:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it would not be justifiable to set aside a
judgment and remand the case for reception of evidence that might not suffice
to induce a conclusion or lead to a result different from that previously
arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, the record
must show the nature and import of the purported evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner failed to observe this rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards that portion of the order imposing a fine of P50.00 a
day in case of petitioner's failure to repair within five days after it has
been reported, peti­tioner argues that the same was arbitrary, since it
subjected petitioner to lia­bility even for disruptions of service caused by
other and subsequent fortuitous events.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such argument is fallacious, for there is nothing on record to sustain
the thesis that the PSC intended the questioned order to cover situations not
due to, or connected with, typhoon "<span class="SpellE">Dading</span>”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the argument proceeds upon pure
hypothesis, since there is no proof that any of the fortuitous events envisaged
by petitioner ever occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
the function of a reviewing court to speculate upon anticipated possibilities
that have never jelled into reality; nor is it its duty to place unreasonable
constructions upon orders brought up for its revision in order to overturn
them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders appealed from are hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs are taxed against the
petitioner.</p>
