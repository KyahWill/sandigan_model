				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from a decision of the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main facts are set forth in said decision from which we
quote:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no dispute at all that the deceased Pedro <span class="SpellE">Caguimbal</span>, Barrio Lieutenant of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Calansayan</span>,
San Jose, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, was a paying passenger of BTCO
bus, with plate TPU-507, going south on its regular route from <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna, to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, driven by Tomas Perez, its regular driver, at
about 5:30 o'clock on the early morning of April 25, 1954.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased's destination was his residence
at <span class="SpellE">Calansayan</span>, San Jose, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Batangas</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
bus of the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> Transportation Company, bearing
plate TPU-820, driven by <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
was coming from the opposite direction (north-bound).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the national highway at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Daraza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, on the date and hour above indicated, a
horse-driven rig (<span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span>) managed by Benito <span class="SpellE">Makahiya</span>, which was then ahead of the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
bus, was also coming from the opposite direction, meaning proceeding towards
the north.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to what transpired
thereafter, the lower court chose to give more credence to defendant <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company's version which, in the
words of the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'As the BTCO bus was nearing a house, a
passenger requested the conductor to stop as he was going to alight, and when
he heard the signal of the conductor, the driver Tomas Perez slowed down his
bus swerving it farther to the right in order to stop; at this juncture, a <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span> then driven by Benito <span class="SpellE">Makahiya</span>
was at a distance of several meters facing the BTCO bus coming from the
opposite direction; that at the same time, the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
bus was about 100 meters away likewise going northward and following the
direction of the <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span>; that upon seeing the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus, the driver of the BTCO bus dimmed his light as
established by <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilaw</span>,
the very conductor of the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus at the time of
the accident; that as the <span class="SpellE">calesa</span> and the BTCO bus
were passing each other from the opposite directions, the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
bus following the <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span> swerved to its left
in an attempt to pass between the BTCO bus and the <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span>;
that without diminishing its speed of about seventy (70 ) kilometers an hour,
the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus passed through the space between the
BTCO bus and the <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span> hitting first the left
side of the BTCO bus with the left front corner of its body and then bumped and
struck the <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span> which was completely
wrecked; that the driver was seriously injured and the horse was killed; that
the second and all other posts supporting the top of the left side of the BTCO
bus were completely smashed and half of the back wall to the left was ripped
open (Exhibits 1 and 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The BTCO bus
suffered damages for the repair of its damaged portion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence of this occurrence, two (2) passengers of BTCO
died, namely, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Caguimbal</span> and Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, apart from others who were injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The widow and children of <span class="SpellE">Caguimbal</span>
instituted the present action, which was tried jointly with a similar action of
the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>, to recover damages from the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Transportation Company, hereinafter referred to as
BTCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, in turn, filed a
third-party complaint against the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
Transportation Company — hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
— and its driver, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Caguimbals</span>
amended their complaint, to include therein, as defendants, said <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> rendered a decision dismissing the complaint
insofar as the BTCO is concerned, without prejudice to plaintiffs' right to sue
<span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> — which had stopped partici­pating in the
proceedings herein, owing, apparently, to a case in the Court of First Instance
of Laguna for the insolvency of said enterprise — and <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
and without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal taken by the <span class="SpellE">Caguimbals</span>, the
Court of Appeals reversed said decision and rendered judgment for them,
sentencing the BTCO, <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>
to, jointly and severally, pay to the plaintiffs the aggregate sum of P10,
500.00<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and costs in both instances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
appeal by BTCO, upon the ground that the Court of Appeals erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) in finding said ap­pellant liable for
damages; and 2) in awarding attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the first assignment of error, we note that
the recklessness of defendant <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> was, manifestly,
a major factor in the occurrence of the accident which resulted, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, in the death of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Caguimbal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as driver of the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
bus, he overtook Benito <span class="SpellE">Makahiya's</span> horse-driven rig
of <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span> and passed between the same and the
BTCO bus despite the fact that the space available was not big enough <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, in view of which the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span>
bus hit the left side of the BTCO bus and then the <span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals
rendered judgment against the BTCO, upon the ground that its driver, Tomas
Perez, had failed to exercise the "extraordinary diligence," required
in Article 1733 of the new Civil Code, "in the vigilance for the
safety" of his passengers.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that, in order to permit one of them to
disembark, Perez drove his BTCO bus partly to the right shoulder of the road
and partly on the asphalted portion thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, he could have and should have seen to it — had he exercised
"extraordinary diligence" — that his bus was completely outside the
asphalted portion of the road, and fully within the shoulder thereof, the width
of which being more than sufficient to accommodate the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have and should have done this,
because, when the aforementioned passenger expressed his wish to alight from
the bus, <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> had seen the aforementioned "<span class="SpellE">calesa</span>", driven by <span class="SpellE">Makahiya</span>,
a few meters away, coming from the opposite direction, with the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus about 100 meters behind the rig, cruising at a
good speed.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Perez slowed down his BTCO bus to permit
said passenger to disembark, he must have known, therefore, that the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus would overtake the "<span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span>",
at about the time when the latter and BTCO bus would probably be on the same
line, on opposite of the asphalted portions of the road, and that the space
between the BTCO bus and the "<span class="SpellE"><u>calesa</u></span>"
would not be enough to allow the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus to go
through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the driver of
the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> bus should have slowed down or stopped,
and, hence, was reek less in not doing so; but, he had no especial obligations
toward the passengers of the BTCO, unlike Perez whose duty was to exercise
"utmost" or "extraordinary" diligence for their safety.
Perez was thus under obligation to avoid a situation which would hazardous for
his passengers, and make their safety dependent upon the diligence of the <span class="SpellE">Biñan</span> driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
obligation becomes more patent when we consider the fact — of which the Court
may take judicial cognizance — that our motor vehicle drivers, particularly
those of public utilities, have not distinguished themselves for their concern
over the safety, the comfort or the convenience a others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Besides, as correctly
stated in the syllabus to <span class="SpellE">Brito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Malate</span> Taxicab &amp; Garage, Inc.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"In an action based on a contract of car­riage, the court need
not make an express finding of fault or negligence on the part of the carrier
in order to hold it responsible to pay the damages sought for by the passen­ger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the contract of carriage, the carrier
assumes the express obligation to transport the passenger to his destination
safely and to observe extraordinary diligence with a due regard for all the
circumstances, and any injury that might be suffered by the passenger is right
away attributable to the fault or negligence of the carrier (Article 1756, new
Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an exception to the
gen­eral rule that negligence must be proved, and <u>it is therefore incumbent
upon the carrier to prove that it has exercised extraordinary diligence</u> as
prescribed in Article 1733 and 1755 of the new Civil Code. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, BTCO has not proven the exercise of
extraordinary diligence on its part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
this reason, the case of Isaac vs. A. L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span> Trans.
Co., Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
relied upon by BTCO, is not in point, for, in said case, the public utility
driver had done "everything he could to avoid" the accident, and
could not have possibly avoided it, for he "swerved the bus to the very <u>extreme</u>
right of the road, which the driver, in the present case, had failed to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second assignment of error, appellant argues that
the award of attorney's fees is not authorized by law, because, of the eleven
(11) cases specified in Article 1208 of the new Civil Code, only the fifth and
the last are relevant to the one under consideration; but the fifth case
requires bad faith, which does not exist in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As regards the last case, which permits the
award, "where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> should be
recovered," it is urged that the evidence on record does not show the
existence of such just and equitable grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, however, believe otherwise, for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the accident in question took place on
April 25, 1954, and the <span class="SpellE">Caguimbals</span> have been
constrained to litigate for over thirteen (13) years to vindicate their rights;
and (2) it is high time to impress effectively upon public utility operators
the nature and extent of their responsibility in respect of the safety of their
passengers and their duty to exercise greater care in the selection of drivers
and conductors and in supervising the performance of their duties, in
accordance, not only with Article 1733 of the Civil Code of the Philippines,
but, also, with Articles 1755 and 1756 thereof<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

elucidated by the Commission that drafted the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>
