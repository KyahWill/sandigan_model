				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><em></em><p>On December 20, 1960, a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was
filed by Jose Lava, et al. before the Court of First Instance of Rizal,
Quezon City Branch, praying that, being illegally detained by
respondents, they be released from confinement or granted provisional
liberty under such terms and conditions which the court may deem
reasonable to prescribe after filling the bonds that may be required
for the purpose. On December 21, 1960, the court issued an order
directing respondents to produce the persons of petitioners Jose Lava,
et al. on a date therein set, as well as to show cause why the writ
should not be issued, or petitioners should not be given their freedom
as prayed for.</p>
<p>Respondents appeared on the date set by the courtbringing with them
the persons of petitioners, and during the hearing that ensued wherein
the counsel of both petitioners and respondent were allowed to argue
and discuss the issues raised, counsel for respondents manifested his
opposition to the writ on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction
over the case.</p>
<p>After a brief hearing, respondents were given five days within which
to file their answer to the petition, which they did alleging therein
the following as main ground of their opposition: that the Court of
First Instance of Quezon City has no jurisdiction over the case it
appearing that after the conviction of petitioners in the rebellion
case filed against them they were confined as detention prisoners
pending their appeal before the Supreme Court so that under the law
petitioners are under the custody of the Supreme Court and as such no
other court, much less the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, "can
make any disposition of the custody of their persons." </p>
<p>Considering that the special defense set up by respondents was in
the nature of a motion to dismiss, they asked that a day be set for the
hearing of such special defense, which request the court granted, and
at such hearing the court expressed the view that while the issue of
jurisdiction would not be passed upon until after the hearing of the
case on the merits is held, it however manifested in passing that it
had jurisdiction to act on the petition it being one for <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>
<p>And since respondent court, after hearing the case on the merits,
may grant the petition and order the release of petitioners on bail
even if the State should appeal from the decision of the court,
respondents had no other alternative than to interpose the present
petition seeking to prohibit respondent judge from acting on the
petition alleging that he has no jurisdiction to act thereon for the
reasons already adverted to.</p>
<p>This petition was given due course in a resolution issued on January
12, 1961. On the same date, a writ of preliminary injunction was
issued, without bond.</p>
<p>Jose Lava, et al., in their answer, stressed that respondent court has jurisdiction to entertain their petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>because
the same is conferred upon it by Section 2, Rule 102 of the Rules of
Court and Sections 17 and 44 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. Counsel
contends that, once respondent court has assumed jurisdiction over the
petition, all other courts, including the Supreme Court, which have
concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter, are excluded, and the
argument of comity among courts cannot prevail over the express grant
of jurisdiction by the aforesaid provisions of law. </p>
<p>It appears that Jose Lava, et al., who filed the instant petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>,
were charged in Criminal Cases Nos. 14071 and 14270 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila with the crime of rebellion complexed with
other crimes enumerated in the informations, of which they were
convicted in a decision rendered on May 21, 1951, the court sentencing
some of them to death penalty and the others to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
Because of the nature of the penalties imposed, as well as the appeals
interposed by the accused, the cases were elevated to this Court for
review, where they are pending decision up to the present time.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on July 18, 1956, this Court, in the case of People <em>vs.</em>
Hernandez, G.R. Nos. L-6025-26, (99 Phil., 515) ruled that the crime of
rebellion cannot be complexed with other crimes that may be committed
in furtherance thereof, although if the latter are committed with
personal motives the accused may be separately convicted thereof and
sentenced accordingly, which simple rebellion is punishable under
Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code only with <em>prision mayor</em> and a fine of not more than P20,000.00. And the abovementioned ruling was later reiterated in the cases of People <em>vs.</em> Geronimo, 100 Phil., 90, and People <em>vs.</em> Tongonon, 101 Phil., 804.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above ruling, Jose Lava, et al. now contend that
the decision of the court that found them guilty of rebellion complexed
with other crimes and sentenced them to life imprisonment and death
acted in excess of its jurisdiction because they could only be found
guilty of simple rebellion with a maximum penalty of 12 years
imprisonment as ruled by this Court, and since the penalty which should
have been imposed upon them was at most 12 years imprisonment, it
follows that Jose Lava, et al. are entitled to bail as a matter of
constitutional right because in the eye of the law they were only
charged with the crime of simple rebellion, which is bailable, though
erroneously interpreted b(y the trial court in the aforesaid case.</p>
<p>Considering that Jose Lava, et al. were under preventive
imprisonment since October 18, 1950 by the Director of Prisons and, up
to the time of the filing of the instant petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>,
had been deprived of their liberty for more than 11 years, and would
probably continue under detention indefinitely because of the pendency
of their appeal before the Supreme Court, aside from the fact that
Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, which credits detention prisoners
with only 50% of the period of their detention, is violative of the due
process and equal protection clauses of our Constitution, counsel
contends that they are entitled to be given their freedom, even if
provisionally, considering the period of time that they had been under
detention, plus the commutations to which convicts are allowed under
the law. Hence, they contend, the instant petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> is justified and should be granted.</p>
<p>Without passing upon the merits of the instant petition, we are of
the opinion that respondent court has no jurisdiction over the case it
appearing that the criminal cases in which Jose Lava, et al. were
convicted and ordered confined are presently on appeal before this
Court. In contemplation of law, therefore, said accused are under the
custody of this Court and, hence, no other court,much less one of lower
category, can make any disposition of the custody of their persons
without interferring with the authority of the Supreme Court. And this
is so because only this Court has the authority and jurisdiction to
review, affirm, reverse or modify the decision appealed from because of
the nature of the penalty imposed. Moreover, if the respondent court
would be allowed to assume jurisdiction of the instant petition, it
would in fact be acting as a reviewer of the decision of the court that
has rendered it, which is a co-equal and coordinate court. This,
admittedly, cannot be allowed.</p>
<p><em>Habeas corpus</em>, on the other hand, is not the proper remedy
for the correction of the error which the accused seek to secure in the
instant case for the authorities are clear that errors of judgment
cannot be corrected through the remedy of <em>habeas corpus</em>. In a long line of decisions this Court has consistently held that <em>habeas corpus</em> will not lie to correct errors of fact or of law.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>
The only exception to this rule is when the error affects the court's
jurisdiction or is one that would make the judgment absolutely void, as
may be gleaned from our decision in the recent case of Pomeroy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"With reference to persons in custody pursuant to a final judgment, the rule is that the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>
can issue only for want of jurisdiction of the sentencing court, and
can not function as a writ of error. Hence, the writ will not lie to
correct mere mistakes of fact or of law which do not nullify the
proceedings taken by a court in the exercise of its functions, if the
court has jurisdiction over the crime and over the person of the
defendant (Talabon <em>vs.</em> Prov. Warden, 78 Phil. 599; Perkins <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons, 58 Phil. 271; Paguntalan <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons, 57 Phil. 140; Trono Felipe <em>vs.</em> Director of' Prisons, 24 Phil. 121; U.S. <em>vs.</em> Jayme, 24 Phil. 90; McMicking <em>vs.</em> Schields, 238 U.S. 99; 41 Phil. 971).</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>"In
providing for complex crimes, the Revised Penal Code did not set up a
category of crimes independent of the component ones, but only for an
aggravated form thereof. This rule was impelled by the desire to impose
only one penalty for all offenses resulting from one and the same
criminal impulse. Whether or not the offenses are so related as to
constitute one single punishable violation evidently depends upon the
Court's appreciation of the facts of the case and the applicable law,
and not upon its jurisdiction, since it is not contested that the
various component crimes were within the Court's power to try and
adjudicate. Granting that the sentencing court's estimate of the facts
and its conclusions as to the governing law were erroneous, the mistake
did not render it powerless to act upon the premises nor deprive it of
authority to impose the penalty that in its view of the case was
appropriate. The view it had taken was not such capricious and
whimsical exercise of judgment or grave abuse of discretion as would
amount to lack or excess of jurisdiction, since at that time the
Supreme Court had affirmed convictions for the complex crime of treason
with murder and other offenses. As a matter of fact, the existence of
the 'complexed' rebellion is still upheld to this day by a sizable
number of lawyers, prosecutors, judges and even justices of this Court.
Hence, <em>the error committed was correctible only by reasonable wppeal, not by attack in the jurisdiction of the sentencing Court."</em> (Pomeroy, et. al. <em>vs.</em> The Director of Prisons, et al., 107 Phil., 50; Italics supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the strength of the foregoing authorities, the conclusion is
inescapable that respondent court has no jurisdiction to act on the
instant petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> it appearing
that the criminal cases wherein Jose Lava, et al. were convicted and
ordered confined were decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
respondent court cannot likewise grant the provisional liberty that
they seek for because that power at the present stage of said cases
lies with the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is granted. Respondent court is hereby enjoined permanently from proceeding with the petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>
filed by Jose Lava, et al., or from making any disposition as regards
their custody, for reasons expressed in this decision. No costs.</p>
