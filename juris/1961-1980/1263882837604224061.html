Evaluation Division of the Commission to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Portal Cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver
characterized by increased connective tissue that spreads from the portal
spaces, with distortion of the liver; architecture, and impairment of liver
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Malnutrition is believed to
be the primary etiologic factor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fatty
infiltration (accumulation of fat in the liver) <span class="SpellE">messenchymal</span>
<span class="SpellE">inflamatory</span> reaction, fibrosis and <span class="SpellE">parenchymatous</span> changes combine to produce in the usual
course of events, a large hard and diffuse­ly modular level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many cases the enlargement persists until
death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Portal cirrhosis is not inherent in the deceased's work as a
nursing attendant or midwife, therefore, her ill­ness could not have been
directly caused by her work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could
also say that the nature of claimant's work could not have aggravated her
illness because from the <span class="SpellE">physiopathogenesis</span> of portal
cirrhosis, medical authorities believe that the destruction of the liver cells
are caused by the pressure of intercellular fat droplets on the liver cells
obstructing sinusoidal circulation sufficiently to cause <span class="SpellE">anexic</span>
damage <span class="SpellE">centrilobular</span> tissues, and that fibrous
deposits forming about <span class="SpellE">extracellular</span> fatty <span style="">cysts </span>condense
into <span class="SpellE">fibrotic</span> <span class="SpellE">trabeculae</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing this, we are of the opinion that
progress of the disease is not influenced by the nature of her work nor by the
activities she performed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Obviously, the respondent Commission only
took note of the foregoing evaluation report and findings of its Evaluation
Division but not the testimony of <span style="">Dr. </span><span class="SpellE">Innocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aparicio</span> to the effect
that the nature of the employment of the deceased did not preclude the
possibility that the illness of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Monsale</span> could have been brought about by the nature of her
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, part of his testimony reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Can
this sickness of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Monsale</span>
be caused also by infection?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It has been established at the hearing as
Midwife II that she had to attend to the cleaning of the barrio clinics, visiting
her patients, going from house to house for immunization work, answering calls
of patients even at night and delivering of babies whenever summoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Aparicio</span> the infection might have been made possible by her
going from house to house performing immunization work or from the fact that
because of her uncertain schedule she was often delayed in taking her meals
which she had to take oftentimes the house of her patients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it <span style="">not be possible that she could have acquired her illness in those
places where she has to take her meals </span>or drink?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the very nature of <span style="">her </span>work
which can easily be described as a strenuous one could have contributed to a
general weakening of her bodily condition and the lessening of her resistance
to the progress of whatever illness she has at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the illness which about the enlargement
of the liver, loss of weight, loss brought of energy, presence of <span class="SpellE">dispeptic</span> disturbance with no pain and <span class="SpellE">acitis</span>
or presence of fluid in the abdominal cavity all of which amount to cancer of <span style="">the liver, may not have been </span>caused
directly by her employment nor the result of the nature of her employment, it
certainly can hardly <span style="">be doubted that it
could have been at least aggravated by the nature of her employment and
therefore compensable under Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In o</span>ne case, it was held that medical
cause of the illness is not legally significant as long as the illness
supervened in the course of employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The presumption of causation or aggravation then applies and the
function for the presumption is precisely to dispense with the need of proof
and the burden to overthrow the presumption and to disconnect, by substantial
evidence, the injury or sickness from employment is laid by the statute at the
door of the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be disputed that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Monsale</span> acquired her illness <span style="">in </span>the
course of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well-established is the jurisprudence that in the absence of substantial
evidence to the contrary it is presumed under the law that an illness or injury
sustained by an employee or worker was <span style="">ca</span>used by or aggravated in the course of her
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that the
employee's illness which caused the death may be ruled out as an occupational
disease<span style=""> </span>or
that the causal link between the nature of his employment and his ailment has
been insufficiently shown, nevertheless, it is to be presumed as mandated by
Section 44 of the Workmen's Compensation Act<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that the employee's illness which supervened during the employment either arose
out of or at least aggravated by said employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with this legal presumption the burden of
proof shifts to the employer and the employee relieved of the burden to show
causation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case before Us the conclusion arrived at by the respondent Commission
that the death of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Monsale</span>
has no causal relation with her employment was not based on any substantial
evidence presented during the trial before the hearing officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evaluation report and findings of the
Evaluation Division relied upon by the respondent Commission in its decision
was vigorously opposed by the petitioner on the ground that, not having been
presented during the trial of the case before the Hearing Officer, petitioner was
not able to confront the person who made the report and rebut the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect the petitioner
claims that the action of the respondent Commission in making the said report
as the basis of its conclusion denied him his day in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a situation such as this an evaluation
report not presented during the trial should not prevail over the substantial
evidence established during the hearing of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>
