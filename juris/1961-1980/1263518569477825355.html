				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal of the accused from a conviction for the crime of rape
committed against an offended party who was only eleven years of age, the
penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> being
imposed as well as an indemnity in the amount of P1,000.00 awarded, does not
pose any question of complexity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant would seek a reversal based solely on what he would allege to
be the errors committed by the lower court in lending credence to the testimony
of the victim and its failure to sustain his defense of alibi sought to be
reinforced by the imputation that the perpetrator of such carnal act was none
other than her own father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A close and
thorough scrutiny of the evidence of record persuades us that the conclusion
reached by the lower court is in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the offended party, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>,
was clear as to how the offense of rape was perpetrated by the accused in his
house at <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atlag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only was he practically a neighbor, but
he was likewise a fourth-degree cousin of her father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1965</st1:date>, she was asked by the wife of the accused, Carmen Cruz, to
fetch water for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That completed, a
request came from him to go inside a room to get a comics magazine.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">She did as she was told.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused followed her, closed the door, covered her mouth with a palm
of his hand and forced her to lie down on a bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through force, he relieved her of her panties
and placed himself on top of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
kicked and struggled to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
succeeded in his design; the act was consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After it was all over, the accused threatened
to kill her if she would not keep her silence and refrain from informing her
parents of this sordid incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor did accused stop there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On three
other occasions, the next two <span style="">days
following and the Sunday after that, he had carnal knowledge of the victim, his
wife apparently all the while unaware of what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was explainable as while the acts were
being performed, she was somewhere else.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As the offended party
testified, were it not for her parents getting suspicious as she had money with
her and she had moreover difficulty in urinating, such occurrences would not
have been brought to light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had to
relate to her father what transpired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was then taken to a Doctor B. Santos, an uncle, in whose clinic she
was examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, she was
brought to the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Provincial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="7"><span style="">July 29, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, where she had to go through the same
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done by Dr. Lydia V.
<span class="SpellE">Camanga</span>, a junior resident physician of the
Provincial Hospital of Bulacan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
seeing no signs of external injuries, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Camanga</span>
proceeded with her internal examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The medical certificate issued the next day was to the effect that while
the labia <span class="SpellE">mejora</span> and labia <span class="SpellE">menora</span>
were intact, there were multiple healed lacerations of the hymen "at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="15"><span style="">3 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="">, </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="">6 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="">, </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 <span style="">o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> and </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="11"><span style="">11 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="">;" and that the vaginal orifice would
admit two fingers, with its wall intact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was found negative for spermatozoa.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of such evidence that the lower court found
the accused guilty as charged, rejecting as incredible his imputation that he
did see on one occasion the father of the offended party embracing her, the
appearances indicating that they had just had intercourse and disbelieving his
plea of alibi, his version being that he was, during the week beginning July
19, 1965, at another place, <span class="SpellE">Namayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> with his
half-brother and another man.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused would have us reverse, insisting on
the defenses thus raised, which, on their face, lacked persuasiveness and which
cannot offset the probative value inherent in the testimony of the offended
party as well as Dr. <span class="SpellE">Camanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor does it detract from the weight to be
accorded the recital made by the offended party considering her tender
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A citation from a recent case is in
point: "Much stress is laid on the alleged incompetence of witness <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> <span class="SpellE">Camasis</span> who was only 11
years old, the defense claiming that she cannot be expected to narrate what she
had seen because of her tender age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is
well-settled that unless a child's testimony is punctured with serious
inconsistencies as to lead one to believe that he was coached, if he can
perceive and make known his perception, he is considered a competent witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a situation does not here obtain, for,
as the trial court has observed, <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> showed that
she was able to relate well her impression of what she had seen despite the
rigid cross-examination she was subjected to by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, therefore, did not err in
giving credence to her testimony."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The enormity of an offense committed against a helpless victim
who is not even in her teens has been underscored by the explicit provision
that rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman when "the
woman is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances
mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>There is not even a need, therefore,
of using force or intimidation, or of the victim being deprived of reason or
otherwise unconscious, as set forth in such paragraphs of this article of the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is not the
least justification for deviating in any particular from the enforcement and
application of such a mandate of the law intended to minimize the incidence of
this particular offense, the perpetrator of which has forfeited the least claim
to sympathy.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>
