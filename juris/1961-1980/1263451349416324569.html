differentials and </span>payment of overtime compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Originally, two complaints were filed
in the Court of Industrial Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Docketed <span style="">as Case </span>1259-V
is one entitled "National Federation <span style="">of
</span>Labor Unions and/or Benita <span class="SpellE">Bulaon</span>, et al.,
petitioners, vs. Sin Hap <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> &amp; Co., respondent";
the other, "National Labor Union and/or <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barnachea</span>, et al., petitioners, vs. Sin Hap Lee &amp; Co.,
respondent," Case 1260-V.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents are sister companies.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the parties' consent and the court's approval, these two
cases were jointly tried before a court-appointed commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, His Honor, Presiding Judge Jose S. Bautista rendered
judgment dated October 19, 1963 -</p>

<p class="BODY">Dismissing Case 1259-V; and in Case 1260-V, granting the petition
<span style="">for </span>overtime pay and directing
the chief of the examining division and/or h<span style="">is </span>assistants to make the necessary computations, and to submit
a report.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The decision in Case 1259-V became final.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">However, respondent in Case 1260-V moved to
reconsider.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1964, the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en banc</u>,
speaking thru Judge <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tabigne</span>,
with the concurrence of Judges <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> I. Martinez, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span style="">M.
Villanueva </span>and <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span>,
reversed Judge Bautista's decision and dismissed Case 1260-V "for lack of <span style="">substantial evidence."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Jose </span>S. Bautista dissented in a <span style="">seÂ­parate opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners in said
Case 1260-V came </span>to this Court <u>in forma <span class="SpellE">pauperis</span></u>,
on appeal by certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case now under review refers to overtime pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period covered is from 1956 to 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Industrial Relations <u>en banc</u>
found that the overtime work rendered by petitioners was recorded in time
records and the payrolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
admitted that they signed the several time records and payrolls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payrolls particularly show, <span style="">so </span>the resolution states, "that
for every overtime appearing in the time records the respondent company had
clearly paid such extra services", that at the time the payrolls were
prepared, "there was no showing that the entries were incorrect or that
they did not reflect the true facts obtaining at the time regarding the
rendition of service by herein petitioners", and that petitioners signed
the payrolls "without compulsion or intimidation" and without making
any observation as to "any irregularity in the entries therein made."</p>

<p class="BODY">Pitted against this documentary evidence <span style="">is </span>the testimony of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Commenting on the oral evidence, the court below stated that <span style="">the "testimonies of the witnesses on
this matter were conflicting and cannot therefore be given due weight and consideration."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the court cited the testimony
of petitioner Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> who told the court that
"there were no entries in the payrolls at the time he affixed his </span><span style="">signatures </span><span style="">thereon."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others declared
that "they did not notice the entries in the payrolls and time records but
they admitted that they affixed their respective signatures thereon."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also testimony to the effect that
all "the entries appearing in the payrolls were already there" at the
time the signatures were affixed thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' brief challenges the findings of the court <u>a quo</u><span style=""> </span>and avers that the <span style="">same </span>are not supported by the <span style="">evidence </span>of record.</p>

<p class="BODY">But this Court is not to be guided by the rule of preponderance
of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, jurisprudence <span style="">is </span>firm in that, on appeal from a
decision of the Court of Industrial Relations, our function is to inquire
whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they are, then <span style="">the </span>judgment must be affirmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time records and payrolls cons<span style="">titute that substantial evidence which props
up the resolution <u>en banc</u> under review.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Just </span><span style="">recently, we ruled that in the presence of
conflicting evidence, the findings of fact of the Court of Industrial Relations
when supported by substantial evidence should not be disturbed.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case just cited fits into the situation here presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a conflict of evidence - oral
evidence on the one side and the time records and payrolls on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the probative value, the court below gave
its nod to the written documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
resolution under review stands; we may not reverse it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the foregoing reasons, we vote to affirm the resolution of
the Court of Industrial Relations <u>en banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
