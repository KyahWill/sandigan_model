<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">At 10:00 A.M. of December 21, 
1960, the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte, apprehended 
three suspicious-looking strangers who were loitering in <span class="SpellE">Pagao</span>, a <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span>. A bag which they were carrying was confiscated with 
the following contents: three carbines, caliber .30 M1; one revolver, caliber 
.22; three flashlights with batteries; two carbine ammunition magazines, fully 
loaded; twelve rounds of carbine ammunition; one <span class="SpellE">balisong</span>; a screw driver; seven false keys, one of which was 
a master key; trousers; shirts; and a pair of shoes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After an investigation the 
aforesaid persons—Ramon Lopez, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Buico</span> and Arturo 
<span class="SpellE">Caniete</span>—were charged in the Justice of the Peace Court 
of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span> with the crime of illegal possession of 
firearms and, in a separate complaint, the crime of illegal possession of false 
keys. They pleaded guilty to illegal possession of firearms, not guilty to 
illegal, possession of false keys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Following the transmittal of the 
record of the case on illegal possession of false keys to the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, <span class="GramE">an 
information</span> was filed therein against the three accused, 
thus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The undersigned Assistant 
Provincial Fiscal accuses <span class="SpellE">Manuri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Buico</span>, Ramon Lopez and Arturo <span class="SpellE">Caniete</span> of the crime of Illegal Possession or False Keys 
committed as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"That on or about the 21st day of 
December, 1960 in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span>, Province 
of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused with deliberate and 
criminal intent and without lawful cause did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously have in their possession, custody and control seven 
(7) false keys, one of which is a picklock or master key.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Contrary to 
Law.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> (Article 
301 in relation to Article 305, both of the Revised Penal Code), with the 
aggravating circumstance that the offenders have been previously punished for an 
offense to which the law attaches an equal or greater penalty, that is, same 
three accused were on 24 December 1960 convicted of Illegal Possession of 
Firearms by the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacuag</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, and thereby sentenced 'to suffer 
imprisonment of three (3) years each and fine of P2.000.00 each’ in Criminal 
Case No. 374."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This time, however, <span class="SpellE">Buico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caniete</span> pleaded guilty. 
Lopez, pleading not guilty, stood trial. After the prosecution presented one 
witness, said accused moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the facts 
charged in the information do not constitute an offense. It was argued that an 
essential element of illegal possession of false was not alleged, namely, that 
the picklock or false in the possession of the accused were "specially Adapted 
to the commission of the crime of robbery". Thereupon, the trial court dismissed 
the case. The prosecution, with commendable sense of duty, 
appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Article 304 of the Revised Penal 
Code provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Art. 304. <u>Possession of 
picklocks or similar tools.</u>—Any person who shall without lawful cause have 
in his possession picklocks or similar tools specially adapted to the commission 
of the crime of robbery, shall be punished by <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u> in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> correctional</u> in its minimum 
period."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Such crime of illegal possession 
of picklocks or similar tools has, accordingly, two elements: (1) possession of 
picklocks or similar tools specially adapted to the commission of the crime of 
robbery; (2) such possession is without lawful cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The information alleged that the 
accused possessed, "<u>without lawful cause</u> . . . seven (7) false keys, 
<u>one of which is a picklock or master key</u>". (Italics 
supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">A picklock—a tool used in picking 
locks—is in itself specially adapted to the commission of robbery of the kind 
provided for in Articles 299 (a) 3 and 302, par. 3 of the Revised Penal 
Code:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"ART. 299. <u>Robbery in an 
inhabited house or public building or Office devoted to worship.</u>—Any armed 
person who shall commit robbery in an inhabited house or public building or 
edifice devoted to religious worship, shall be punished by <u>reclusion 
temporal</u>, if the value of the property taken shall exceed 250 pesos, and 
if—<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"(a) <span class="GramE">The</span> 
malefactors shall enter the house or building in which the robbery was 
committed, by any of the following means:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">*******<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"3. By using false keys, 
<u>picklocks</u> or similar tools." supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Art. 302.<u> Robbery in an 
uninhabited place or in a private building</u>. - Any robbery committed in an 
uninhabited place or in a building other than those mentioned in the first 
paragraph of article 299, if the value of the property taken exceeds 250 pesos, 
shall be punished by <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u> in its medium and maximum periods provided 
that any of the following circumstances is present:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">*******<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"3. If the entrance <span class="GramE">has</span> been effected through the use of keys, <u>picklocks</u> 
or other similar tools." (Italics supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since picking of locks is one way 
to gain entrance to commit robbery, a picklock is per se specially adapted to 
the commission of robbery. The description in the information of a picklock as 
"specially adapted to the commission of robbery" is therefore unnecessary for 
its sufficiency. Notwithstanding the omission of such superfluous description, 
therefore, the charge of the offense of illegal possession of a picklock is 
.valid. We find both elements of the crime clearly alleged in the information in 
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Furthermore, the information 
alleged illegal possession of "seven (7) false keys." The Revised Penal Code, in 
Article 306 defines "false keys" to include "the tools mentioned in the next 
preceding article." Article 304— ""the next preceding article"—mentions 
"picklocks or similar tools specially adapted to the commission of the crime of 
robbery." It follows that the term "false keys" appearing in the information 
sufficiently describes such tools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore, the order quashing the 
information is hereby set aside and the case is remanded for further trial, 
without costs. It is so ordered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
