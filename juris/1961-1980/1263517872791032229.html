				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner John H. <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> prays that
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> <span class="SpellE">Hontanosas</span>
be ordered to cease and desist from taking further proceedings in Civil Case
No. R-11477 before him in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
(Branch XI), and from enforcing the writ or preliminary injunction issued by
him on December 3, 1969 in the aforesaid case; that respondent Judge be ordered
to dismiss the petition in said Civil Case No. R-11477; and that respondent
Provincial Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> <span class="GramE">be</span> ordered to convene itself and forthwith canvass the votes
cast for the office of Representative of the second representative district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in the elections of <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1969</st1:date> and thereafter to proclaim the
candidate duly elected to said office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1969</st1:date>
this Court issued a temporary restraining order directing the respondent Judge,
until further orders from this Court, to cease and desist from taking <span class="GramE">further</span> proceedings in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-11477
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, without prejudice
to the effect of the preliminary injunction is­sued by him on </span><st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 3, 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> in the aforesaid case.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Originally, respondent <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span>, along with Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Florido</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Merilito</span> <span class="SpellE">Aznar</span>,
petitioned the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, in an
ordinary civil action, docketed as Civil Case No. R-11477 in said court, to declare
the election in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which took place on
November 11, 1969, null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>, and to enjoin the Provincial Board of
Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to desist or refrain from making
any canvass of the votes cast for the office of Representative for the second
representative district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and to desist from
proclaiming the winner thereof, because:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) on election day, on November 11, 1969 an unruly mob gathered in the
premises of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> office in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City forcing officials of said office to close the office and flee for their
lives; (2) at about 4:00 in the afternoon of that day <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span> (Policy Adviser of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>),
allegedly on orders of the Commission on Elections, unlawfully gained entrance
into the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> office in City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and allowed the henchmen of the Liberal Party to
ransack the files of the office and extracted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
all the lists and voters' applications and ordered them to be distributed to
the different precincts of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, thereby
allowing some 23,000 voters to cast illegal votes; (3) as a result of the
illegal acts of <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span>
some 17,000 voters allegedly ordered excluded by Judges <span class="SpellE">Laya</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, were allowed to vote; (4) in some precincts of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City voting was actually done even until morning,
contrary to law, allowing voters without the proper registration forms and
pictures to cast their votes; (5) the voting records delivered by order of <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span> to the polling
places were not sealed and signed by the corresponding election registration
boards in violation of the law and of the rules and regulations promulgated by
the Commission on Elections, thus giving rise to frauds in the casting of the
votes; (6) as a result of the illegal orders of <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span> the three copies of the registration forms
of individual voters were brought and distributed illegally to different
precincts, thus allowing a single voter to vote three times in three different
precincts contrary to law; and (7) as a consequence of the foregoing facts,
events and circumstances the election in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
on November 11, 1969, is null and void from the very beginning, it being
impossible to separate the legal votes cast from the illegal ones.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day that the petition in Civil Case No. R-11477 was
filed respondent Judge issued, <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>,
a writ of preliminary injunction directed to the Provincial Board of Canvassers
of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> restraining it from
making any canvass of the votes cast for the office of Representative for the
second representative district of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and/or from
proclaiming the duly elected Congressman for said district.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1969</st1:date>
petitioner John H. <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> filed an urgent motion, to
dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction issued on <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1969</st1:date> and to dismiss the petition in
Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-11477.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of said urgent motion, petitioner
contended that respondent Judge "has no jurisdiction to entertain the
petition and to issue the writ of preliminary injunction, because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) there is no law authorizing the courts to
annul an election except in a regular election protest; (2) the alleged irregularities
should be ventilated in an election protest; and (3) in the case of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> it is the House Electoral Tribunal that is the sole
judge of the election and returns."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge, on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="12">December
 19, 1969</st1:date>, denied the motion to dismiss as well as the prayer to
dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence petitioner <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> filed before this
Court the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i>,
with preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was heard on oral argument on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a careful consideration of the arguments adduced by the parties,
in their pleadings as well as during the oral argument, and of the facts extant
in the record, this Court RESOLVED, as follows:</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">To grant the writs of <i>certiorari</i>
and prohi­bition prayed for, since Court of First Instance have no jurisdiction
to nullify votes cast in a congressional election, apart from the fact that
there is no showing for whom the alleged illegal votes were cast as would
affect the result of the election;</span></p>
