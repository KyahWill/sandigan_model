VS. JESSIE TROUTHMAN, RESPONDENT-APPELLEE.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> Real, litigating as a
pauper, filed on May 22, <span style="">1964 </span>a
petition for habeas corpus in the Court of First Instance of Manila against
Jessie <span class="SpellE">Trouthman</span> alleging mainly that on <span style="">May </span><span style="">6, 1964, </span>the latter, a married man,
persuaded his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> Real, by means of
deceit, force, threats, intimidation and misrepresenta足tion, to elope and live with
him, without the knowledge and consent of her parents, and that she has since
then been detained by <span class="SpellE">Trouthman</span> and prevented from
returning to appellant in violation of Article 403 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant thus prayed for the issuance of a
writ of habeas corpus ordering the production of his daughter before the court
and after hearing, that the latter issue an order directing her to "return
to and live with the petitioner" plus payment of damages and attorney's
fees, with costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">An order was issued for <span class="SpellE">Trouthman</span> to
appear before it and produce the said <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> Real on
May 25, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Trouthman</span> did so and, in compliance
with a verbal order of the court, also filed his answer on May <span style="">26, 1964, </span>alleging that <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> Real went voluntarily with him and that at the
Police station, she herself, <span style="">in </span>the presence of her parents, explained that she voluntarily
left home to go with him, thus causing the Police authorities to consider the
case closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the answer was <span class="SpellE">Lilian's</span> affidavit attesting to her voluntary deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the lower court found that <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span>
Real had attained the age of majority on May <span style="">16, 1964 </span>and that respondent was not detaining her nor <span style="">restraining her liberty or freedom nor
preventing her from returning to her parents; that in fact she herself
manifested, during the trial and afterwards - in the conference conducted for a
possible amicable settlement - that she joined respondent freely and
voluntarily and was not willing to go back to her parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of these, the lower court dismissed
the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
this appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 403 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. <span style="">403.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding the provisions of the
preceding article, a daughter <u>above </u><u><span style="">twenty-one but below twenty-three years of age</span></u><span style=""> </span>cannot leave the parental home without
the con足sent of the father or mother in whose company she lives, except to
become a wife, or when she exercises a profession or calling, or when the
father or mother has contracted a subsequent marriage." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are left with no other alternative but to order <span style="">the </span>dismissal, because as of now,
1967, <span class="SpellE">Lilian</span> Real is already more than 24 years of
age and hence is unquestion足ably beyond the coverage of Article 403.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for habeas corpus is dis足missed on
the ground that the same has become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span><span style=""> </span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>, Sanchez, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Castro, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>
