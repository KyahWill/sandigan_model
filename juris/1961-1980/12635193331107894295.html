				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The objection by the Republic of the Philippines, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, now appellant, to the grant of citizenship to
petitioner, now <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Henry <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chuang</span>, was premised primarily on his failure to file
a declaration of intention, which in his opinion was unnecessary because of his
birth in this country, ignoring the fact that his primary and secondary
education, as it turned out, was obtained in Chinese schools, the recognition
of which was testified to solely by himself and not by official certification
to such effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such deficiencies
notwithstanding, the lower court, satisfied that his petition should prosper,
rendered a decision in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
matter is now before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respect for the
control­ling principles of law leaves us no alternative but to reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for naturalization was filed in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no declaration of intention, petitioner relying on his being
born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and his completion of primary and secondary education in government-recognized
schools, namely, the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename>

was granted in a decision of <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the order
of <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1967</st1:date> allowing
petitioner to take his oath of allegiance as Filipino citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an order was received on May 15, 1967 by
the then Solicitor General, now Associate Justice, Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, who immediately filed by registered mail a motion
for reconsider­ation on the ground that the lower court never validly acquired
jurisdiction in view of the failure of the petition to file a declaration of
intention, his alleged right to be exempt <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
being unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
reconsideration was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the brief for the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed by the then Solicitor General, now Associate Justice, Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, there was a reiteration of the above contention
of lack of juris­diction as the principal error assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As set forth in such brief:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On the witness stand petitioner claimed
he finished his elementary education at the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span>
Chinese School in the year 1952, and his secondary education at the Sun <span class="SpellE">Yat</span> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> High School in Iloilo
City in the year 1956 * * *, but the only evidence offered to prove that these
schools were recognized by the government was petitioner's own self-serving
declaration to that effect * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly petitioner is not competent to testify on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The best evidence of government recognition
would have been the certificates of recognition issued to the schools by the
Bureau of Private Schools, or certified true copies thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Why petitioner was not entitled to be exempt in filing a
declaration of intention was next taken up therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Undersigned counsel however consulted the 'List of Authorized
Private Schools and Courses' issued by the Bureau of Private Schools, which shows
that the certificate of government recognition issued to the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> Chinese School authorized it in 1959 to offer the
complete elementary course <u>for Chinese schools</u>, while the Sun <span class="SpellE">Yat</span> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> High School was in 1957
authorized to offer the complete secondary course <u>for Chinese schools</u>
(Bureau of Printing, Manila 1963, pp. 230 &amp; 116).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That these schools offer curricula for
Chinese schools and that the very names of the schools are Chinese clearly
indicate they are Chinese schools.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, these schools had not yet been recognized by the government
when the petitioner studied there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
completed his elementary in 1952 at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place> * * *, whereas the school
was recognized by the government only in 1959.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He completed his secondary in 1956 at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Sun</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Yat</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sen</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
* * *, whereas it was recognized only in 1956.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He therefore cannot be said to have taken his primary and secondary
education in government recognized schools and hence cannot be exempted from
filing a declaration of intention under Section 6 of Commonwealth Act
473."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The legal proposition in support of the above assignment of error
was furnished by Ng v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><i>

of intention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although born in the
Philippines, he is not exempted from the obligation to submit said declaration
having failed to prove that he had received his 'primary and secondary

limited to any race or nationality</u>.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1969</st1:date>, the case was deemed
submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, to repeat, finds for appellant Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition is vitiated by a jurisdictional
defect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, considering the
incontrovertible facts of record, could not validly lay claim to an exemption
from the filing of a declaration of intention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law as consistently interpreted by this Court casts upon him a duty
of compliance with such a requirement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cannot be deemed as excluded from its operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even more recently, in <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court again speaking through the Chief Justice, there was a reiteration of
the above doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It should be noted, however, that to
impart the benefits of said exemption, petitioner's primary and secondary
education - in addition to birth in the Philippines - must have been received
'in public schools or those <u>recognized</u> by the Government and <u>not
limited to any race or nationality</u>.' The record shows that the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City Chinese High School was <u>not</u> granted
Government recognition until 1958, whereas <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
finished high school therein in 1959, so that the institution had <u>not</u>,
as yet been recognized by the Government when he completed his primary and
elementary education, as well as when he finished second year high school in
1957."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> <i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The latest case in point, Lim v. Republic,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the opinion being penned by Justice Castro, speaks to the same effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Resolving this appeal, it suffices for us to state that the
petition for naturalization was correctly denied, and this upon the ground, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that the petitioner has not complied
with the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the Naturalization Law * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>

 <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place> where the petitioner
received his primary and intermediate education is definitely a Chinese school,
as its name imparts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And altho Exhibit
AA for the petitioner, dated August 28, 1968, which is a certification by
Principal Luis G. Uy, states that the school 'is recognized by the Philippine
Government, and that the enrolment of this school is not limited to any race or
nationality and Philippine history, government and civics are also taught as
part of the school curriculum,' nevertheless there is no evidence that it was
'regularly attended by a sizeable number of Filipino students from whom
applicant could have imbibed Filipino customs and traditions,' in order to
place him within the exemption of the law * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner-appellant not being exempt
from the filing of a declaration of intention, and having failed to file one,
his application for naturalization was therefore vitiated by a fatal
jurisdictional defect * * *, which rendered the entire proceeding null and
void."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>
