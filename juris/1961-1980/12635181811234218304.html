				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The invocation of his right to free speech by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Amelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span>, then a candidate
for delegate to the Constitutional Convention, in this special civil action for
prohibition to assail the validity of a ruling of respondent Commission on
Elections enjoining the use of a taped jingle for campaign purposes, was not in
vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could it be, considering the
conceded absence of any express power granted to respondent by the
Constitutional Convention Act to so require and the bar to any such implication
arising from any provision found therein, if deference be paid to the principle
that a statute is to be construed consistently with the fundamental law, which
accords the utmost priority to freedom of expression, much more so when
utilized for electoral purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1970</st1:date>, the very same day
the case was orally argued, five days after its filing, with the election
barely a week away, we issued a minute resolution granting the writ of
prohibition prayed for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This opinion is
intended to explain more fully our decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this special civil action for prohibition filed on October 29,
1970, petitioner, after setting forth his being a resident of <span class="SpellE">Arayat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and his
candidacy for the position of delegate to the Constitutional Convention,
alleged that respondent Commission on Elections, by a telegram sent to him five
days previously, informed him that his certificate of candidacy was given due
course but prohibited him from using jingles in his mobile units equipped with
sound systems and loudspeakers, an order which, according to him, is "<span class="SpellE">violative</span> of [his] constitutional right * * * to freedom of
speech."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
There being no plain, speedy and adequate remedy, according to petitioner, he
would seek a writ of prohibition, at the same time praying for a preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the very next day, this
Court adopted a resolution requiring respondent Commission on Elections to file
an answer not later than <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1970</st1:date>,
at the same time setting the case for hearing for <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="11">Tuesday, November 3, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No preliminary injunction was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no denial in the answer filed by
respondent on November 2, 1970, of the factual allegations set forth in the
petition, but the justification for the prohibition was premised on a provision
of the Constitutional Convention Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which made it unlawful for candidates "to purchase, produce, request or
distribute sample ballots, or electoral propaganda gadgets such as pens,
lighters, fans (of whatever nature), flashlights, athletic goods or materials,
wallets, bandanas, shirts, hats, matches, cigarettes, and the like, whether of
domestic or foreign origin."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It was its contention that the jingle proposed to be used by petitioner is the
recorded or taped voice of a singer and therefore a tangible propaganda
material, under the above statute subject to confiscation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It prayed that the petition be denied for
lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was argued, on <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1970</st1:date>, with petitioner
appearing in his behalf and Attorney <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Felizmeña</span> arguing in behalf of respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, after deliberation and taking into account the need for
urgency, the election being barely a week away, issued on the afternoon of the
same day, a minute resolution granting the writ of prohibition, setting forth
the absence of statutory authority on the part of respondent to impose such a
ban in the light of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>ejusdem</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span> as well as the principle that the
construction placed on the statute by respondent Commission on Elections would
raise serious doubts about its validity, considering the infringement of the
right of free speech of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
concluding portion was worded thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Accordingly, as prayed for, respondent Commission on Elections is
permanently restrained and prohibited from enforcing or implementing or
demanding compliance with its aforesaid order banning the use of political
jingles by candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This resolution
is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">1. As made clear in our resolution of <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1970</st1:date>, the question before us was one
of power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission on
Elections was called upon to justify such a prohibition imposed on
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, no such authority
was granted by the Constitutional Convention Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did contend, however, that one of its
provisions referred to above makes unlawful the distribution of electoral
propaganda gadgets, mention being made of pens, lighters, fans, flashlights,
athletic goods or materials, wallets, bandanas, shirts, hats, matches and
cigarettes, and concluding with the words "and the like."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
For respondent Commission, the last three words sufficed to justify such an
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We view the matter
differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done cannot merit
our approval under the well-known principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>ejusdem</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span>, the general words following any
enumeration being applicable only to things of the same kind or class as those
specifically referred to.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is quite apparent that what was contemplated in the Act was the distribution
of gadgets of the kind referred to as a means of inducement to obtain a
favorable vote for the candidate responsible for its distribution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more serious objection, however, to the ruling of respondent
Commission was its failure to manifest fealty to a cardinal principle of
construction that a statute should be interpreted to assure its being in
consonance with, rather than repugnant to, any constitutional command or prescription.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, certain Administrative Code provisions were given a "construction
which should be more in harmony with the tenets of the fundamental law."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The desirability of removing in that fashion the taint of constitutional
infirmity from legislative enactments has always commended itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judiciary may even strain the ordinary
meaning of words to avert any collision between what a statute provides and
what the Constitution requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
objective is to reach an interpretation rendering it free from constitutional
defects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, if at all possible, the conclusion reached must
avoid not only that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that
score.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2. Petitioner's submission of his side of the controversy, then,
has in its favor obeisance to such a cardinal precept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The view advanced by him that if the above
provision of the Constitutional Convention Act were to lend itself to the view
that the use of the taped jingle could be prohibited, then the challenge of
unconstitutionality would be difficult to meet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, in unequivocal language, the Constitution prohibits an abridgment
of free speech or a free press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
been our constant holding that this preferred freedom calls all the more for
the utmost respect when what may be curtailed is the dissemination of
information to make more meaningful the equally vital right of suffrage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What respondent Commission did, in effect,
was to impose censorship on petitioner, an evil against which this
constitutional right is directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
could respondent Commission justify its action by the assertion that
petitioner, if he would not resort to a taped jingle, would be free, either by
himself or through others, to use his mobile loudspeakers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the constitutional guarantee is
not to be emasculated by confining it to a speaker having his say, but not
perpetuating what is uttered by him through tape or other mechanical
contrivances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this Court were to
sustain respondent Commission, then the effect would hardly be distinguishable
from a previous restraint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cannot
be validly done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would negate
indirectly what the Constitution in express terms assures.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">3. Nor is this all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
concept of the Constitution as the fundamental law, setting forth the criterion
for the validity of any public act whether proceeding from the highest official
or the lowest functionary, is a postulate of our system of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to manifest fealty to the rule of
law, with priority accorded to that which occupies the topmost rung in the
legal hierarchy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three departments
of government in the discharge of the functions with which it is entrusted have
no choice but to yield obedience to its commands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever limits it imposes must be
observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress in the enactment of
statutes must ever be on guard lest the restrictions on its authority, whether
substantive or formal, be transcended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Presidency in the execution of the laws cannot ignore or dis­regard
what it ordains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its task of applying
the law to the facts as found in deciding cases, the judiciary is called upon
to maintain inviolate what is decreed by the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even its power of judicial review to pass
upon the validity of the acts of the coordinate branches in the course of
adjudication is a logical corollary of this basic principle that the
Constitution is paramount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It overrides
any governmental measure that fails to live up to its mandates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby there is a recognition of its being
the supreme law.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be more specific, the competence entrusted to respondent
Commission was aptly summed up by the present Chief Justice thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Lastly, as the branch of the <u>executive</u>
department – although independent of the President -- to which the Constitution
has given the 'exclusive charge' of the '<u>enforcement</u> and administration
of all laws relative to the conduct of elections, ' the power of decision of
the Commission is limited to purely <u>'administrative</u> questions.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been the constant holding of this Court, as it could not have been
otherwise, that respondent Commission cannot exercise any authority in conflict
with or outside of the law, and there is no higher law than the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Our decisions which liberally construe its powers are precisely inspired by the
thought that only thus may its responsibility under the Constitution to insure
free, orderly and honest elections be adequately fulfilled.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
There could be no justification then for lending approval to any ruling or
order issuing from respondent Commission, the effect of which would be to
nullify so vital a constitutional right as free speech.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's case, as was obvious from the
time of its filing, stood on solid footing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as set forth in our Resolution of <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1970</st1:date>, respondent

<u>executive</u> department - although independent of the President - to which
the Consti­tution has given the 'exclusive charge' of the <u>'enforcement</u>
and <u>administration</u> of all laws relative to the conduct of elections,'
the power of decision of the Commission is limited to purely <u>'administrative</u>
questions.’ (Article X, Sec. 2, Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
It has no authority to decide matters 'involving the right to vote. 'It may not
even pass upon the legality of a given vote (<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party <i>v.</i> Commission on Elections, 47 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>.,

more far-reaching authority</u> to determine who - among those possessing the
qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, who have complied with the
procedural requirements, relative to the filing of certificates of candidacy -
should be <u>allowed</u> to enjoy the full benefits intended by law

specific statutory grant of such general, broad power as the Commission claims
to have, it is dubious whether, if so granted - in the vague, abstract,
indeterminate and undefined manner necessary in order that it could pass upon
the factors relied upon in said resolution (and such grant must not be deemed
made, in the absence of clear and positive provision to such effect, which is
absent in the case at bar) - the legislative enactment would not amount to
undue delegation of legislative power. (<span class="SpellE">Schechter</span> <i>vs.</i>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In line with my separate opinion in <span class="SpellE"><u>Badoy</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions of the 1971
Constitutional Convention Act, I concur with the views of Mr. Justice Fernando in
the main opinion that "there could be no justification .... for lending
approval to any ruling or order issuing from respondent Commission, the effect
of which would be to nullify so vital a constitutional right as free speech."
I would only add the following observations:</p>

<p class="BODY">This case once again calls for application of the constitutional
test of reasonableness required by the due process clause of our
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally, respondent
Commission in its guidelines prescribed summarily that the use by a candidate
of a "mobile unit - roaming around and announcing a meeting and the name
of the candidate ... is prohibited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
it is used only for a certain place for a meeting and he uses his sound system
at the meeting itself, there is no violation."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting upon petitioner's application, however, respondent Commission ruled that
"the use of a sound system by anyone be he a candidate or not whether
stationary or part of a mobile unit is not prohibited by the 1971
Constitutional Convention Act" but imposed the condition - "provided
that there are no jingles and no streamers or posters placed in carriers."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission's narrow view is that "the use of a
'jingle,' a verbally recorded form of election propaganda, is no different from
the use of a 'streamer' or 'poster', a printed form of election propaganda, and
both forms of election advertisement fall under the prohibition con­tained in
sec. 12 of R. A. 6132, " and "the record disc or tape where said
'jingle' has been recorded can be subject of confiscation by the res­pondent
Commission under par. (E) of sec. 12 of R. A. 6132. " In this modern day
and age of the electronically recorded or taped voice which may be easily and
inexpensively disseminated through a mobile sound sys­tem throughout the candidate's
district, respondent Commission would outlaw <u>"recorded or taped voices</u>"
and would exact of the candidate that he make use of the mobile sound system
only by <u>personal transmission</u> and repeatedly <u>personally</u> sing his
"jingle" or deliver his spoken message to the voters even if he lose
his voice in the process or employ another person to do so <u>personally</u>
even if this should prove more expensive and less effective than using a
recorded or taped voice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission's strictures clearly violate, therefore,
petitioner's basic freedom of speech and expression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot pass the constitutional test of
reasonableness in that they go far beyond a reasonable relation to the proper
governmental object and are manifestly unreasonable, oppressive and arbitrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the placing of the candidate's "streamers"
or posters on the mobile unit or carrier is concerned, respondent Commission's
adverse ruling that the same falls within the prohibition of section 12,
paragraphs (C) and (E) has not been appealed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would note that respondent Commission's
premise that "the use of a 'jingle' ... is no different from the use of a
'streamer' or 'poster' " in that these both represent forms of election
advertisements - to make the candidate and the fact of his candidacy known to
the voters - is correct, but its conclusion is not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The campaign appeal of the "jingle"
is through the voters' ears while that of the "streamers" is through
the voters' eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if it be held that
the Commission's ban on "jingles" abridges unreasonably, oppressively
and arbitrarily the candidate's right of free expression, even though such
"jingles" may occasionally offend some sensitive ears, the
Commission's ban on "streamers" being placed on the candidate's
mobile unit or carrier, which ''streamers" are less likely to offend the
voters' sense of sight should likewise be held to be an unreasonable,
oppressive and arbitrary curtailment of the candidate's same constitutional
right.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intent of the law to minimize election expenses as invoked by
respondent Commission, laudable as it may be, should not be sought at the cost
of the candidate's constitutional rights in the earnest pursuit of his
candidacy, but is to be fulfilled in the strict and effective implementation of
the Act's limitation in section 12(G) on the total expenditures that may be
made by a candidate or by another person with his knowledge and consent.</p>
