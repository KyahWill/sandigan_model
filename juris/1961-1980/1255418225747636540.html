				<H3>RAMON A. GONZALES, PETITIONER VS. RUFINO G. HECHANOVA, ETC., ET AL., RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is  an original action  for prohibition with  preliminary injunction.
<p>It is not disputed that on September 22, 1963, respondent Executive
Secretary authorized the importation of 67,000 tons of foreign rice to
be purchased from private sources, and created a rice procurement
committee composed of the other respondents herein for the
implementation of said proposed importation. Thereupon, or on September
25, 1963, herein<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> petitioner, Ramon A.
Gonzales—a rice planter, and president of the Iloilo Palay and Corn
Planters Association, whose members are, likewise, engaged in the
production of rice and corn—filed the petition herein, averring that,
in making or attempting to make said importation of foreign rice, the
aforementioned respondents "are acting without jurisdiction or in
excess of jurisdiction", because Republic Act No. 3452— which allegedly
repeals or amends Republic Act No. 2207—explicitly prohibits the
importation of rice and corn by "the Rice and Corn Administration or <em>any other
    
government agency"</em>;  that petitioner  has no other plain,
    
speedy and adequate  remedy  in  the ordinary  course of
    
law;  and that a preliminary injunction is  necessary for
    
the preservation of the rights  of  the parties during the
    
pendency of this case and to prevent the judgment therein
    
from becoming ineffectual.  Petitioner  prayed,  therefore,
    
that  said  petition  be  given due  course; that a writ of
    
preliminary  injunction  be  forthwith issued  restraining
    
respondents, their  agents or representatives from  implementing the decision of the Executive Secretary to import
    
the aforementioned foreign rice; and that, after due hearings judgment  be  rendered  making said injunction  permanent.</p>
<p> Forthwith, respondents were required to file their answer to the petition which they did, and petitioner's prayer
      
for a  writ of preliminary injunction was set for hearing,
      
at which both parties  appeared and argued orally.  Moreover, a memorandum was filed, shortly thereafter, by the
      
respondents.  Considering, later on, that the resolution of
      
said incident may require some pronouncements that would
      
be more appropriate  in  a decision on the  merits  of the
      
case,  the same was set  for hearing  on the  merits  soon
      
thereafter.  The parties,  however, waived the  right to
      
argue orally, although counsel for respondents  filed their
      
memoranda. </p>
<p><em>I. Sufficiency of  petitioner's interest. </em></p>
<p>Respondents  maintain that the status of petitioner as
        
a rice planter does not give him sufficient interest to file
        
the petition  herein and  secure the relief therein prayed
        
for.  We find no merit in this pretense.  Apart from prohibiting the importation of rice and corn "by the Rice and
        
 Corn  Administration  or any other government agency",
        
 Republic Act No. 3452 declares, in Section 1 thereof, that
        
 "the policy of the Government" is to  "engage in the purchase of these basic foods <em>directly</em> from those tenants, farmers, growers, producers and landowners <em>in the Philippines </em>who wish to dispose of their products at a price that will
        
 afford them a fair and just return 'for their labor and capital investment.  *   *   *."  Pursuant to this provision,
        
 petitioner, as a planter with a rice land of substantial proportion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
is entitled to a chance to sell to the Government the rice it now seeks
to buy abroad. Moreover, since the purchase of said commodity will have
to be effected with public funds mainly raised by taxation, and as a
rice producer and landowner petitioner must necessarily be a taxpayer,
it follows that he has sufficient personality and interest to seek
judicial assistance with a view to restraining what he believes to be
an attempt to unlawfully disburse said funds.</p>
<p><em>II. Exhaustion of administrative remedies.</em></p>
<p>Respondents assail petitioner's right to the relief s prayed
        
 for because he "has not exhausted all administrative remedies available to him before coming  to court".    We have
        
 already held,  however, that the  principle requiring the
        
 previous exhaustion of administrative remedies is not applicable "where the question in dispute is purely a legal
        
 one",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  or where the controverted act  is "patently illegal"
        
 or was  performed without  jurisdiction  or in  excess  of
        
 jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
or where the respondent is a department secretary, whose acts as an
alter-ego of the President bear the implied or assumed approval of the
latter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  unless actually  disapproved by him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  or  where  there are circumstances  indicating the  urgency  of  judicial  intervention.
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">          
</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The case at bar falls under each one of the  foregoing exceptions to  the general rule.   Respondents'  contention  is,
          
therefore, untenable.</p>
<p><em>III. Merits  of petitioner's  cause of action. </em></p>
<p>Respondents question the sufficiency of petitioner's cause
          
of action  upon the theory that  the proposed importation
          
in question is  not governed by Republic  Act Nos. 2207 and
          
3452, but was authorized by the President as commander-
          
in-chief "for military stock pile purposes" in the exercise of
          
his  alleged authority  under Section 2  of Commonwealth
          
Act No.  I; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that in cases of necessity,  the  President "or
          
his  subordinates  may take  such  preventive measure for
          
the  restoration of good order  and maintenance  of peace";
          
and that,  as  Commander-in-Chief  of our armed  forces,
          
"the President  *   *  *  is  duty-bound to prepare  for the challenge of threats of war or emergency without waiting <em>for any special authority."</em></p>
<p>Regardless of whether Republic Act No. 3452 repeals
            
Republic Act No. 2207, as contended by petitioner herein
            
on which our view need not be expressed—we are unanimously  of the  opinion—assuming that said Republic Act
            
No. 2207 is still  in force—that the two Acts  are applicable to  the proposed  importation in question  because the
            
language of  said laws is  such as to include  within the
            
purview thereof <i>all</i> importations of rice and corn into the
            
Philippines.  Pursuant to Republic Act No. 2207, "it shall
            
be unlawful  for  any  person, association, corporation or
            
<i>government agency</i> to  import rice and corn into any point
            
in the Philippines", although, by way of exception, it adds
            
that "<em>the President of the Philippines</em> may authorize the
            
importation of  these commodities through any government
            
agency that he  may designate", if the conditions prescribed
            
in Section 2 of said Act are present.  Similarly, Republic
            
Act No. 3452 explicitly  enjoins "the Rice and Corn Administration  or <em>any government  agency</em> from importing
            
rice and corn.</p>
<p> Respondent allege, however, that said provisions of Republic Acts
Nos. 2207 and 3452, prohibiting the importation of rice and corn by any
"government agency", do not apply to importations "made by the
Government itself", because the latter is not a "government agency".
This theory is devoid of merit. The Department of National Defense and
the Armed Forces of the Philippines, as well as respondents herein, and
each and every officer and employee of our Government, are government
agencies and/or agents. The applicability of said laws even to
importations by the Government, as such, becomes more apparent when we
consider that:</p>
<ol><li>The importation permitted in Republic Act No. 2207
                    
is to be  authorized by <em>"the President of the Philippines"</em>,
                    
  
                    

                    
 and, hence, by or on behalf of the Government of the Philippines;<br>
  </li><li>Immediately
after enjoining the Rice and Corn Administration and any other
government agency from importing rice and corn, Section 10 of Republic
Act No. 3452 adds " that <em>the importation of rice and  corn is  left  to
                      
 private parties</em> upon payment of the corresponding  taxes",
                      
 thus indicating that only "private parties" may import rice
                      
 under its provisions; and<br>
  </li><li>Aside from prescribing a fine not exceeding P10,000.00
                        
 and imprisonment of not more than five  (5)  years for
                        
 those  who  shall violate any provision of  Republic  Act
                        
 No. 3452 or any rule and regulation promulgated pursuant
                        
 thereto,  Section  15 of said Act provides that "if the offender is  a <em>public  official </em>and/or employee", he shall be
                        
 subject to the additional penalty specified therein.  A public
                        
 official is  an  officer of  the  Government  itself,  as  distinguished from  officers or employees of instrumentalities of
                        
the Government.   Hence, <em>the duly authorized acts  of the
                        
 former are those of the Government,</em> unlike  those of a government instrumentality which may have a personality of
                        
 its own, distinct and separate from that of the Government,
                        
 as such.   The provisions of Republic Act No. 2207 are, in
                        
this respect, even more  explicit.  Section 3  thereof provides a similar additional penalty for any "officer or employee <i>of the Government</i>" who "violates, abets or tolerates
                        
 the  violation of any provision" of said Act.  Hence, the
                        
 intent to apply the same to  transactions made by the very
                        
government is patent.</li></ol>
<p>Indeed, the  restrictions imposed in said  Republic Acts
                      
are merely <em>additional</em> to those prescribed in Commonwealth
                      
Act No. 138, entitled "An Act to give native products and
                      
domestic entities the preference in the purchase of articles <em>for the Government</em>"  Pursuant to Section 1 thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The Purchase and Equipment Division of the <em>Government of the
                            
Philippines </em>and  other officers and employees of the municipal and
                            
provincial governments <em>and  the  Government of the Philippines</em> and
                            
            
                            

                            
of chartered  cities, boards, commissions,  <em>bureaus, departments, offices, agencies, branches,</em>
and bodies of any description, including government-owned companies,
authorized to requisition, purchase, or contract or make disbursements
for articles, materials, and supplies for public use, public buildings,
or public works, shall <em>give preference to materials  *  *  * produced * * * in the Philippines</em> or
                            
in the  United  States,  and to  <em>domestic entities,</em> subject to the
                            
conditions hereinbelow specified." (Italic  supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under this  provision, in all purchase  <em>by the  Government,</em> including those made by and/or for the armed forces,
                          
  <em>preference shall be given to materials produced in the Philippines</em>.  The  importation involved in the case  at bar violates this general  policy of our Government, aside  from
                          
the provisions of Republic  Act Nos. 2207 and 3452.</p>
<p> The attempt to  justify the  proposed importation by invoking reasons of national security—predicated upon the
                            
"worsening situation in Laos and Vietnam", and "the recent tension created by the Malaysia problem"—and the
                            
alleged powers of  the  President as  commander-in-chief of
                            
all armed forces  in the Philippines, under  Section  2 of
                            
the  National  Defense Act  (Commonwealth Act No. 1),
                            
overlooks the fact that the protection of local planters of
                            
rice and corn in a  manner that would foster and accelerate
                            
self-sufficiency in the local production of said commodities
                            
constitutes  a factor  that is vital  to our ability to meet a
                            
possible national emergency.    Even  if the intent in importing goods in anticipation  of  such emergency were to
                            
bolster up  that ability, the latter would,  instead, be impaired if the  importation were so made as to  discourage
                            
our farmers from engaging in the production of rice.</p>
<p>Besides,  the stocking  of  rice  and corn  for purposes
                              
of national security and/or national  emergency is within
                              
the purview of Republic Act  No. 3452.  Section 3 thereof
                              
expressly authorizes the Rice  and Corn Administration "to
                              
accumulate stocks as a <em>national reserve</em> in such quantities
                              
as it may deem proper and necessary to meet  any contingencies".   Moreover,  it ordains  that "<em>the  buffer stocks
                              
 held as a national reserve  *  *   *  be  deposited by the
                              
 
                              

                              
Administration  throughout the country under proper dispersed plans</em> * * * and maybe released only upon the occurrence of calamities or<em> emergencies  * </em>* *  (Italic  supplied.)</p>
<p> Again,  the  provisions  of Section 2  of Commonwealth
                                
 Act No. 1, upon which respondents rely so much,  are not
                                
 self-executory.   They merely outline the general objectives
                                
 of said legislation.  The means  for  the  attainment  of
                                
 those objectives  are  subject  to congressional legislation.
                                
 Thus, the conditions under which  the services of citizens,
                                
 as indicated  in  said  Section  2, may  be  availed  of, are
                                
 provided for in Sections 3, 4 and 51 to 88 of said Commonwealth  Act No.  1. Similarly, Section 5  thereof  specifies
                                
 the manner in which resources necessary for our national
                                
 defense may be  secured by the Government of the Philippines, but only "<em>during  a national  mobilization"</em>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which
                                
 does  not  exist.   Inferentially,  therefore,  in  the absence
                                
 of a national mobilization, said resources shall be produced
                                
 in such  manner  as Congress  may  by <em>other </em>Laws provide
                                
 from time to time.  Insofar as rice and corn are concerned,
                                
 Republic Act  Nos. 2207  and 3452, and  Commonwealth
                                
Act No. 138 are such  laws.</p>
<p> Respondents cite Corwin in support of their pretense,
                                  
 but in vain.  An  examination of the work cited <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> shows
                                  
that Corwin referred to the powers of the President during "war time" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  or when he has placed  the country or a part thereof under "martial law". <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>   Since neither  condition obtains  in the  case at bar, said work merely proves
                                    
that  respondents' theory, if accepted,  would, in  effect,
                                    
place the Philippines under martial law, without a declaration of  the Executive to that  effect.   What is worse, it
                                    
would keep us <em>perpetually</em> under martial law.</p>
<p> It has been suggested that even if the proposed importation violated Republic Acts Nos. 2207  and 3452, it should,
                                      
nevertheless, be  permitted because "it  redounds to  the
                                      
benefit of the people".  <em>Salus populi  est  suprema  lex, </em>it
                                      
is said.</p>
<p> If  there were a  local  shortage of  rice, the argument
                                        
might have some value.   But the respondents, as officials
                                        
of this  Government, have expressly  affirmed  again and
                                        
again that there is no rice  shortage.   And  the  importation is avowedly for <em>stockpile  of the Army</em>—not the civilian
                                        
population.</p>
<p> But  let us follow the respondents' trend of  thought.
                                          
It  has  a  more serious  implication  than  appears on  the
                                          
surface.   It implies that if an executive officer believes that <em>compliance</em>  with a  certain  statute  will not  benefit the
                                            
 people, he is  at liberty to disregard it.  That idea  must
                                            
be  rejected—we still live under a  rule of law.</p>
<p> And  then, "the people" are either  producers or consumers.  Now—as respondents explicitly admit—Republic
                                              
 Acts Nos. 2207 and 3452 were approved by the Legislature
                                              
 for  the benefit, of  producers  and  consumers,  i.e-, the
                                              
 people, it must follow that the welfare of  the people lies
                                              
 precisely in the compliance with said Acts.</p>
<p>It is not for respondent executive officers  now to set
                                                
 their own  opinions against that of  the  Legislature, and
                                                
 adopt means or ways to set  those  Acts at  naught.   Anyway, those  laws permit  importation—but  under certain
                                                
 conditions, which have not been, and should be complied
                                                
 with.</p>
<p align="left">IV. <span style="font-style: italic;">The  Contracts  With Vietnam and Burma.</span></p>
<p>It is lastly contended that the Government of the Philippines has
already entered into two (2) contracts for the purchase of rice, one
with the Republic of Viet Nam, and another with the Government of
Burma, that these contracts constitute valid executive agreements under
international law; that such agreements became binding and effective
upon signing thereof by representatives of the parties thereto; that in
case of conflict between Republic Acts Nos. 2207 and 3452 on the one
hand, and; the aforementioned contracts, on the other, the latter
should prevail, because, if a treaty and a statute are inconsistent
with each other, the conflict must be resolved—under the American
jurisprudence—in favor of the one which is latest in point of time;
that petitioner herein assails the validity of acts of the executive
relative to foreign relations in the conduct of which the Supreme Court
cannot interfere; and that the aforementioned contracts have already
been consummated, the Government of the Philippines having already paid
the price of the rice involved therein through irrevocable letters of
credit in favor of the sellers of said commodity. We find no merit in
this pretense.</p>
<p> The Court is not satisfied that the status of said contracts as
alleged executive agreements has been sufficiently established. The
parties to said contracts do not appear to have regarded the same as
executive agreements. But, even assuming that said contracts may
properly be considered as executive agreements, the same are unlawful,
as well as null and void, from a constitutional viewpoint, said
agreements being inconsistent with the provisions of Republic Acts Nos.
2207 and 3452. Although the President may, under the American
constitutional system, enter into executive agreements <em>without</em> previous  legislative authority, he may <i>not</i>, by  executive agreement, enter
                                                    
 into a transaction which is <em>prohibited</em> by statutes enacted
                                                    
 prior thereto.  Under the  Constitution, the main function
                                                    
 of the Executive is to  enforce  laws  enacted by Congress.
                                                    
 The former may not interfere  in the performance of  the
                                                    
 legislative powers of the latter,  except  in  the  exercise
                                                    
 of his veto power.  He may not defeat legislative enactments that have acquired the status of laws, by <em>indirectly
                                                    
 repealing the same through an executive agreement providing for the performance of the very act prohibited by said
                                                    
laws.</em></p>
<p>The American theory to the effect  that, in  the event
                                                      
 of conflict between a <em>treaty</em> and a statute, the one which
                                                      
is latest  in point  of time  shall prevail, is not applicable
                                                      
to the case at bar, for respondents  not only admit, but,
                                                      
 also, insist that the contracts adverted  to are <i>not</i>
treaties. Said theory may be justified upon the ground that treaties to
which the United States is signatory require the advice and consent of
its Senate, and, hence, of a branch of the legislative department. No
such justification can be given as regards executive agreements not
authorized by previous legislation, without completely upsetting the
principle of separation of powers and the system of checks and balances
which are fundamental in our constitutional set up and that of the
United States.</p>
<p>As  regards  the   question whether  an  international
                                                        
 agreement may be  invalidated  by  our courts, suffice it
                                                        
to say that the Constitution of the Philippines has clearly
                                                        
 settled it in the affirmative, by providing,  in Section  2
                                                        
of Article VIII thereof, that the Supreme Court may not
                                                        
be deprived "of its jurisdiction  to review, revise,  reverse,
                                                        
 modify, or affirm  on appeal, certiorari, or writ of error,
                                                        
 as the law or the rules of court may  provide, final judgments and decrees of inferior courts in—(1)  All  cases in

 In other words, our  Constitution authorizes the nullification of a  threaty, not only  when  it  conflicts with the
                                                        
 fundamental law<i>, but, also, </i><em>when it  runs counter to an
                                                        
act of Congress.</em></p>
<p> The alleged consummation of the aforementioned contracts with Vietnam and  Burma does  not  render this
                                                          
 case  academic.  Republic  Act  No.  2207  enjoins  our
                                                          
 Government  <i>not</i> from entering  into  contracts  for the
                                                          
 purchase of rice,  but from <i>importing</i>  rice, except under
                                                          
 the conditions prescribed in  said Act.  Upon the other,
                                                          
 Republic Act No. 3452 has two (2) main features,  namely;
                                                          
 (a)  it requires the  Government to   purchase rice and
                                                          
 corn  directly  from our local planters, growers  or landowners; and (b) it  prohibits importations of rice by the
                                                          
 Government,  and leaves  such<em> importations </em>to   private
                                                          
 parties.  The  pivotal issue in this case is whether  the proposed  <em>importation</em>—which has not been consummated ad
                                                          
 yet—is legally feasible.</p>
<p>Lastly,  a judicial  declaration  of  illegality  of the proposed  importation would  not compel  our Government to
                                                            
 default in the performance  of such  obligations as it may
                                                            
            
                                                            

                                                            
have contracted with  the  sellers of the rice  in question,
                                                            
because, aside from the fact that said obligations may be
                                                            
complied with <em>without importing</em> the commodity  into the
                                                            
Philippines, the proposed  importation may still be legalized by complying with the provisions of the  aforementioned laws.</p>
<p> V. <i>The writ of preliminary injunction.</i></p>
<p> The members of the Court have divergent opinions on
                                                              
the  question whether  or  not  respondents  herein should
                                                              
be enjoined from implementing  the aforementioned proposed importation.  However, the  majority favors  the
                                                              
negative view, for which reason the  injunction  prayed
                                                              
for cannot be granted.</p>
<p> Wherefore,  judgment  is  hereby  rendered  declaring
                                                                
that respondent Executive Secretary had and has no power
                                                                
to authorize the importation  in question; that he exceeded
                                                                
his  jurisdiction  in  granting  said authority;  that  said
                                                                
importation is not sanctioned by law  and is contrary to
                                                                
its provisions; and that, for lack of the requisite majority,
                                                                
the  injunction  prayed for must be and is,  accordingly,

<p>My  answer is in  the  negative.  Since this Act does
                                                                      
        not in any manner  provide  for the importation  of rice
                                                                      
        and  corn in case of national  emergency,  the provision
                                                                      
        of the former law on the matter should stand, for that
                                                                      
        is not inconsistent with any provision embodied in Republic
                                                                      
        Act  3452.   The Rice and Corn Administration,  or any
                                                                      
        other government  agency,  may therefore still import rice
                                                                      
        and  corn into  the Philippines  as  provided  in Republic
                                                                      
Act 2207 if there  is a declared  national emergency.</p>
<p> The next question  that  arises is: Can the government
                                                                      
        authorize the importation  of rice and corn regardless of
                                                                      
        Republic Act 2207 if that is authorized  by the President
                                                                      
        as  Commander-in-Chief of  the Philippine Army  as a
                                                                      
        military  precautionary measure for military stock-pile?</p>
<p>Respondents  answer  this  question  in the affirmative.

        is an essential requirement of defense preparation  in view

civil  authority,  the only  exception being  when  the  law
                                                                                

                                                                                

                                                                                
clearly  ordains  otherwise.  Neither  Republic  Act  22,07,
                                                                                
nor  Republic  Act 3452, contains any exception  in  favor
                                                                                
of military action concerning  importation  of rice and
                                                                                
corn.  An exception must be strictly construed.</p>
<p> A distinction is made between the government and government agency
in an attempt to take the former out of the operation of Republic Act
2207. I disagree. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines
under the Revised Administrative Code refers to that entity through
which the functions of government are exercised, including the various
arms through which political authority is made effective whether they
be provincial, municipal or other form of local government, whereas a
government instrumentality refers to corporations owned or controlled
by the government to promote certain aspects of the economic life of
our people. A government agency, therefore, must necessarily refer to
the government itself of the Republic, as distinguished from any
government instrumentality which has a personality distinct and
separate from it (Section 2).</p>
<p>The  important point to  determine, however, is whether
                                                                                    
we  should enjoin respondents  from  carrying out the

been authorized  to be imported  <em>on government </em>to<em> government  level</em>, it appearing  that  the  arrangement to this
                                                                                    
effect has already been concluded, the only  thing lacking
                                                                                    
being its implementation.  This is evident from the manifestation submitted by the  Solicitor General  wherein  it
                                                                                    
appears that  the contract for the purchase of  47,000 tons

can still be  impeded  at this stage of  the negotiations. Though on this score there is  a divergence of opinion, it
                                                                                    
is gratifying to note  that the majority  has  expressed
                                                                                    
itself against  it.   This is a  plausible  attitude  for, had

placed in  a predicament where, as a necessary consequence,
                                                                                    
it would  have to repudiate a  duly  formalized agreement
                                                                                    
to its great  embarrassment  and loss of face.  This was

As already stated, the laws are adequate.  The importation
                                                                                                                
of rice <em>under the conditions set forth  in the laws</em> may be
                                                                                                                
authorized not only where  there is an <em>existing shortage, </em>but also when the shortage is <em>imminent</em>.
In other words, lawful remedy to solve the situation is available, if
only those who have the duty to execute the laws perform their duty. If
there is really need for the importation of rice, why adopt some
dubious means which necessitates resort to doubtful exercise of the
power of the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Army? Why not
comply with the mandate of the laws? Ours is supposed to be a regime
under the rule of law. Adoption as a government policy of the theory of
"the end justifies the means" brushing aside constitutional and legal
restraints, must be rejected, lest we end up with the end of freedom.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I  concur  in the decision of the Court.</p>
