				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal taken by the heirs of the deceased spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> and others from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in Civil Case No. R-6252 dismissing
their complaint against Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> Santos and Aurora
Santos-<span class="SpellE">Dychangco</span>, for the annulment of transactions,
docu­ments, certificates of title, and of certain judicial pro­ceedings had in
said court, and, ultimately, for <span class="SpellE">reconvey­ance</span> of a
parcel of registered land known as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623 of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span> located in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on December 30, 1893, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, married to Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span>,
entered into a contract of purchase and sale of a parcel of land now known as
Lot 2623 of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, situated in <span class="SpellE">Subangdaku</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, with the owner thereof, the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span>
de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract provided, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that should the purchaser fail to pay any installment
of the purchase price agreed upon, the sale would thereby be rendered without
any legal force and effect, with the further understanding that the ownership of
the property would be deemed reverted to the vendor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that there was evidence that the purchaser
– <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> <a name="OLE_LINK1">–</a> failed to comply with the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding is strongly supported by a note
appearing on the back of the first page of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5 - <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> (a Deed of Absolute Sale executed on July 20, 1935
by the Archbishop of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Msgr. Gabriel M. Reyes, as
legal re­presentative of the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San Carlos
de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, widow of the deceased Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>) to the effect that Lot 2623 subject matter thereof
had previously been the subject of another contract of sale executed by Fr.
Pedro Julia (presumably on behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de
San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>) in favor of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, and that it did not appear on the aforesaid
contract that the purchaser had made any payment on account of the install­ments
of the purchase price agreed upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court further found that on <st1:date year="1913" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1913</st1:date>, Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> purchased the same property from the <span class="SpellE">Semi­nario</span> de <st1:city><st1:place>San Carlos</st1:place></st1:city>
de <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There appears in the record – instead of a
formal Deed of Sale in favor of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> – <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 3 and 3-A (Pages 244 and 245, respectively, of the
record of exhibits), the same being receipts issued on December 12, 1913, each
acknowledging receipt from Ber­nardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> of the
sum of P10.00 on account of the purchase price of a portion of Hacienda <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span> owned by the <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span> de
San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <u>occupied by Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of a formal Deed of Sale in favor of the latter was apparently cured
not only by the receipts aforesaid but also by the execution on <st1:date year="1935" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1935</st1:date> of the Deed of Sale <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5 - <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> already mentioned
before in favor of <span class="SpellE">Totoy's</span> widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dovetailing with this is the fact that after
the death of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> in 1918 <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, his widow, went
to court to commence appropriate proceedings for the settlement of his estate,
and listed Lot 2623 as their conjugal property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the property was the subject of a Deed of Partition – duly
approved by the court – between her and her children.</p>

<p class="BODY">When sometime in the year 1916 the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span>
de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> applied for the registration in
its name of Several parcels of land situated in the province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> – Lot 2623 included (Land Registration Case No. 3,
G.L.R.O. Record No. 4030) – Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> filed
his answer or opposition to the application, alleging that he was the ab­solute
owner of Lot 2623, having been in actual, exclusive, continuous, public and
adverse possession thereof since time immemorial, and praying that it be
adjudicated in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the year 1918, a petition for the settlement of the intestate
estate of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> was filed by Attorneys <span class="SpellE">Gullas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Briones</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span> (Special Proceeding No. 755 of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>) on <st1:date year="1922" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1922</st1:date>, on behalf of the widow, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, and their children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot No. 2623 was listed therein as one of the
properties of the estate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on account of a
misunderstanding, counsel for the petitioners withdrew from the case, and this
gave rise to the dismissal of the proceedings but without prejudice to the
filing of a new petition so that the claim of one <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> against the estate for the sum of P1,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 8) could be taken care of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this, Attorney Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, on be­half of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, the widow of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>,
filed on <st1:date year="1922" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1922</st1:date> a
new petition for the settlement of the intestate estate of the letter (Special
Proceeding No. 773; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this proceeding <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> was appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>,
and in due course thereof certain real pro­perties belonging to the estate were
sold to pay the claim of <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As thereafter no other debt remained the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> asked for the summary distribution of the
estate among the heirs and presented a project for the partition of the only
remaining property, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623, among herself, as widow,
and her six children with the deceased Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four of them, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simeona</span>, <span class="SpellE">Honorata</span>, Gregorio and <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>,
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, being then minors, the probate
court appointed the Clerk of Court at that time, Carlos A. Salvador, as their
guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span> charged with the duty of reporting
thereafter to the court on the question of whether the partition was
prejudicial or not to the minors (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, p.
51).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complying with this duty, the
guardian ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span> subsequently reported to the court
that the project of partition was not prejudicial to the interests of the
minors (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 15) and, as a result, on <st1:date year="1924" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1924</st1:date>, the probate court
approved the aforesaid project of partition (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heirs thereafter acknowledged
having received their respective share (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 19 - <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span>), and on <st1:date year="1924" day="28" month="8">August
 28, 1924</st1:date> the court ordered the closure of Special Proceeding No.
773 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 20).</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the widow and heirs of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> sold their respective shares to <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Lira and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Malajacan</span> as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) 1/2 of Lot 2623 was sold to Lira by the
widow, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, on
August 29, 1924 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 21); 1/6 of 1/2 of said lot
inherited by each one of the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> were sold also to <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Lira on different dates (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 23, 22 and 24,
respectively), while 1/6 of 1/2 of the same lot was sold to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Malajacan</span> by each of the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 25-A and 25-B).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remaining 1/12 of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2623 was acquired by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Santome</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simeona</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> from Gregorio G. <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January
8, 1929, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Malajacan</span>, in turn, sold the portions
he had pur­chased from <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilina</span>, both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>,
to <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira, the latter thereby becoming the
owner of 11/12 of Lot 2623 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 26).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the sales mentioned above in favor of Lira, the latter took
possession of the portions subject matter thereof and later leased them to one <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Colina</span> in the month of
September 1933 for a period of five years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from this, Lira appears to have sold the 11/12 portion of Lot 2623
he had acquired as above set forth to one M. E. Cleland on April 6, 1934,
reserving for him­self the right to re-purchase them within one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He re-purchased them on <st1:date year="1935" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1935</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 72
and 73).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the month of September 1937 Attorney <span class="SpellE">Lulalio</span>
Causing, on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, Faustino, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Colina</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Santome</span> intervened in
the land registration proceeding (<span class="SpellE">Expediente</span> No. 3,
G.L.R.O. Record No. 4030), alleging that they had inherited Lot 2623 from the
deceased spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>
and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> who, in turn, had ac­quired it
from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearings held thereafter, Attorney
Causing pre­sented the evidence of his clients, and afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira, represented by Attorney Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, presented his evidence consisting, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, of the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1941" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1941</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira sold his 11/12 portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2623 to Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
41-A - <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, registered only on March 11, 1948)
who, on <st1:date year="1948" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1948</st1:date>, filed
a motion in the registration proceedings to be allowed to substitute Lira as <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>-claimant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This substitution was approved on <st1:date year="1948" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1948</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 42).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of one of the hearings held during the period from
July 1948 to July 1949, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> E. Causing,
attorney for the <span class="SpellE">Godinezes</span>, stated in open court
that, upon his advice, his clients were withdrawing their opposition to the
claim of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> who had acquired the interests
of Lira, while for his part, Attorney Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>,
on behalf of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, stated for the record
that, in view thereof, his client was waiving any claim for damages he had or
might have against the <span class="SpellE">Godinezes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the court had received the evidence of
Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> and of the other claimant, <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Santome</span>, decision was
rendered on <st1:date year="1949" day="23" month="7"><u>July 23, 1949</u></st1:date>
adjudicating 11/12 portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623 to Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, and 1/12 of the same <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2623 to <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Santome</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. XX).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attorney Causing
received notice of the decision on August 8, 1949 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
7) while Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> received a similar notice
thereof on July 30 of the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1949" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1949</st1:date>,
the above-mentioned decision having become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
the court issued an order for the issuance of corresponding Decree of
Registration (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 7-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A subdivision plan dividing Lot 2623 into Lot
2623-A for <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Santome</span>
and Lot 2623-B for Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> made by surveyor <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunagan</span> was subsequently
submitted to the court and the same was approved by the latter on March 9,
1953, together with the technical de­scriptions of the subdivision lots (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 63 to 68).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the month of May 1953, the Decree of Registration was issued and subsequently
Original Certificate of Title No. 35 for Lot 2623-B was issued in the name of
Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, while another Original Certificate
of Title was issued for Lot 2623-A in the name of <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Santome</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the issuance of Original Certificate of Title No. 35 but
after the issuance of the order for the issuance of the Decree of Registration,
Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> mortgaged Lot 2623-B, together with
other properties to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation on January 13, 1951
to secure a loan of P49<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
96); and on August 8, 1958 he sold Lot 2623-B and other properties to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> who assumed the mortgage debt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
84-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on August 11, 1958 Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> sold sub-lots 2623-B-1 and 2623-B-4 to <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> Santos for the sum of P15,700.00 and sub-lots
2623-B-2 and 2623-B-5 to Aurora Santos­-<span class="SpellE">Dychangco</span> for
P17,400.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 84).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Santoses</span> there­after took possession of
their respective acquisitions and subsequently introduced improvements thereon
worth P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, more or less.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' action is based mainly upon the following facts
alleged in their complaint:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that Lot
2623 belonged to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> who
had purchased it from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in the year 1893; that upon their death it was
inherited by their children and grand children – the plaintiffs-appellants –;
that in Land Registration Proceeding No. 3, G.L.R.O. Record No. 4030, the
aforesaid lot was decreed and registered in 1948 in the name of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, succes­sor in interest of <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Lira who had died in 1947; that the aforesaid decree and registration were void
because the plaintiffs-appellants were not given their day<i> </i>in court due
to the fact that, in the course of the proceedings, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Causing, who, represented the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, informed the
court that<i> </i>his clients were withdrawing their claim to Lot 2623, for
which reason the same was registered in the name of said Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, as succes­sor
in interest of <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira, must be deemed to be a
mere trustee and must therefore be sentenced to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the land to the plaintiffs-appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious from the foregoing that appellants' action is based
entirely upon the claim that Lot No. 2623 – purchased in 1893 by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San
Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> - ­was still their property when they
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears in this connection that
the lower court, after a careful review of the record, found that the <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> spouses did not comply faithfully with their
obligation to pay the purchase price as stipulated in the contract of sale
executed in their favor by the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San
Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which contract, as adverted to
previously, provided that, in the event the purchasers failed to pay the
installments into which the purchase price was divided, on their respective
maturity, the contract would be rendered without legal force and effect and
that thereby the ownership of the property subject matter thereof would be
deemed reverted to the vendor, without reimbursement to the purchasers of all
the payments made theretofore by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not find in the record evidence sufficient to overcome this
finding made by<i> </i>the trial court; to the con­trary, the following
significant circumstances of record would seem to strongly support it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the purchase was made by <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and his wife in the year 1893 there is no
conclusive evidence that they remained in possession thereof as owners until
their respective death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, the trial court held that there was evidence that on December 12, 1913
Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, whose wife was Vicente (or Jacinta)
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, one of the children of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span>, purchased the same property from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carlos
de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; that, as a matter of fact, in 1916
Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> filed his answer in Land
Registration Case No. 3, G.L.R.O. Record No. 4030, opposing the registration of
Lot 2623 in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San Carlos
de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, claiming the same as his own exclusive
property; that the lower court found that Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>
and his children took possession of the property from the date of its purchase
(December 12, 1913); that the same remained in his possession until his death,
and that thereafter, the property passed into the possession of his widow and
children; that, as a matter of fact, in Intestate Proceeding No. 773 instituted
for the settlement of the estate of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>,
said property was the sub­ject of a Deed of Partition executed by his wife and
all his heirs, which deed was duly approved by the probate court; that
thereafter the <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> heirs received and took
possession of their respective shares until they and their mother sold their
11/12 share in the property (Lot 2623) to <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Lira, and the remaining 1/12 to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Malajacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, it is an undisputed fact that in Land
Registration Case No. 3, G.L.R.O. Record No. 4030, <span class="GramE">deci­sion</span>
was rendered on <st1:date year="1949" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1949</st1:date>
adjudicating 11/12 portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623 to Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, who had acquired the rights and interests therein
of <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The remaining 1/12 was adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Petronilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Santome</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
this decision had become <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and after the
issuance of the correspond­ing Decree of Registration, Original Certificate of
Title No. 35 was issued in the name of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although this re­gistration proceeding as
well as Special Proceeding Nos. 755 and 773 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> are <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> and
remained pending in said court for several years, it was only on <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1959</st1:date> that appellants
commenced the present action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
that they had not taken any positive step to make known, much less to vindicate
their claim to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the record shows that after Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
had acquired the rights of <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira in Lot 2623,
the property had become, the subject of transactions with third parties, as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 13, 1951 <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> mortgaged the property to the Rehabilitation Finance
Corporation to secure a loan of P49.000.00; on August 8, 1958 Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> sold his 11/12 portion of Lot 2623 to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> who assumed the mortgage debt, and finally, on
August 11, 1958, after the property he had acquired had been duly subdivided,
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> sold subdivision Lots 2623-B-1 and
2623-B-4 to <span class="SpellE">appel­lees</span> <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
Santos and Aurora Santos-<span class="SpellE">Dychangco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' inaction, therefore, had made it
possible for third parties to acquire rights in the mentioned property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts set forth above, it is not hard to con­clude that
either appellants' cause of action – assuming that they ever had one as heirs
of the deceased spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>
and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> – had prescribed at the time they
filed suit, or that, because of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, they may not
now be heard to assail the validity of the transactions mentioned heretofore,
much less the validity of the judicial proceedings that resulted in the
adjudication of the property in question to Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the appellants who descended from the spouses <u>Bernardino
<span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> </u>and <span class="SpellE"><u>Vicenta</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> </u>cannot claim the property in question as
their heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, their
theory in this case is that they had inherited an ali­quot part of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2623 as heirs of the deceased spouses <span class="SpellE"><u>Benigno</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span></u> and <u>Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot now change that theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, while it is true that,
upon the evidence of record, Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> and his
wife acquired Lot 2623 from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San
Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, such evidence is likewise clear that
their rights thereto were subsequently acquired by <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Lira through purchase from his widow, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, and his children; that Lira, in turn, sold his
rights and interests to Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> and the
latter subsequently re-sold the property to Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the third place, the widow and children of
Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> are clearly in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
to deny that the latter acquired the pro­perty from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span>
de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> because, as stated heretofore,
Bernardino's widow alleged in her petition in Special Proceedings Nos. 755 and
773 that Lot 2623 was their conjugal property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, it was in due time partitioned among herself and
their children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, they may not
now be heard to say that the sales they executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira are void, there being absolutely no evidence
in the record to justify such conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither may all the appellants claim that the sale by Lira to Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> is fictitious and void, for the reason that they
have absolutely nothing to do with said transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">While what has been said heretofore would seem to be sufficient
to sustain the appealed decision, we shall never­theless consider briefly the
specific questions raised in the assignments of error submitted in appellants'
brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first assignment <span class="GramE">appellants</span> claim
that the lower court "did not have jurisdiction to render the decision
dated <st1:date year="1949" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1949</st1:date>,
awarding the land to Attorney Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>,"
said decision being, therefore, void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This contention is predicated on the alleged lack of authority of
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Causing to waive the claim of his
clients to Lot 2623 and that waiver him on their behalf is void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No argument is needed to show that the
alleged lack of authority of Attorney Causing – assuming that it is a fact –
did not deprive the registration court of its jurisdiction over the case and of
its authority to render judgment therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, it does not appear that, subsequent to the waiver
made in open court, the clients of Attorney Causing had taken seasonably any
serious step to question his authority to make it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides this issue raised at this late time
is in reality of no decisive importance in this case brought by appellants
claiming rights to Lot 2623 not as heirs of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> but as
heirs of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>
and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> who – as is manifest from what has
been said heretofore – did not own the property at the time of their death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Attention must now be drawn to the fact that Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> married <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> (Jacinta) <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, one of the heirs of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, the heirs of the latter could not have been ignorant of the fact that
in 1913 Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> and his wife had purchased
the property from the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span> de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; that in 1935 <i>a </i>formal Deed of Sale was
executed in fa­vor of <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>
by Archbishop Reyes as legal repre­sentative of the <span class="SpellE">Seminario</span>
de San Carlos de <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; nor of the fact that in 1916
Bernardino made <i>a </i>formal claim of ownership of Lot 2623 when he filed
his answer-opposition in Registration Case No. 3, G.L.R.O. Record No. 4030;
that in Special Proceeding Nos. 755 and 773, Lot 2623 was included amongst the
conjugal properties owned by the deceased Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>
and his wife, and that as a result of said proceedings it was later partitioned
between his widow and their children; that afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and her children sold their shares to <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira.</p>

<p class="BODY">The points raised in appellant's second and third assignments of error
need not be discussed in detail, the same having been sufficiently answered by
what has been said heretofore.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the fourth assignment of error, appellants claim that they
were not allowed to introduce evidence to prove that the signatures of one
"<span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Lira" on <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
Exhibits 27, 29-A, 41-A and 72 are forgeries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that need be said regarding this issue is that appellants have no
right to raise it because there is no claim or pretense on their part that they
are heirs or successors in interest of Lira.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' contention in the fifth assignment of error – that
the trial court erred in holding that Original Certificate of Title No. 35
issued in the name of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> has already
become indefeasible – is based upon the claim that such title was the product
of an <u>illegal</u> registration of property acquire from persons who did not
own it and that such registration proceedings were fraudulent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged illegal registration is without merit, it being clear
from what has been said heretofore that Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
acquired <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623 from <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span>
Lira who, in turn, acquired it from the widow and children of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as the alleged fraud in the registration proceedings is
concerned, we find that there is nothing in the record to support it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the contrary, the record discloses that
the proceedings were pending in court for many years and appellants were duly
represented by counsel who was duly served with notice of all proceedings had
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The alleged lack of
authority of Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> Causing to make a
statement in open court to the effect that his clients were withdrawing their
opposition to the registration of Lot 2623 in the name of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> could, of course, have been raised only by <span class="SpellE">Causings</span> clients, not by such of appel­lants who claim
rights to the property as heirs of the deceased spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and her children represented by Attorney <span class="GramE">Causing,</span> should have raised that point seasonably, if it was
true that they had not authorized their counsel to make such a statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now too late for them to be allowed to
do so after so many years; especially after the death of Attorney Causing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, inasmuch as appellants' present
suit is based on the claim that they inherited the property from <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>, the question of
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Causing's</span> alleged lack of authority to make
the statement mentioned heretofore is obviously ir­relevant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged invalidity of the titles issued in the names of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> Santos and
Aurora Santos-<span class="SpellE">Dychangco</span> – covered by the sixth assignment
of error – needs scant consideration in view not only of what has been said
heretofore but also because said parties are clearly purchasers in good faith
of lands registered in the name of their vendor, without notice regarding the
rights claimed by appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the seventh assignment of error, appellants contend that
assuming that Jacinta (<span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>) <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span>
had any right to sell Lot 2623, such authority must be confined exclusively to
her 1/2 share therein because <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> was survived by four legitimate children, Jacinta (<span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>) being the eldest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With what has been said heretofore regarding the fact that the deceased
spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and
Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> were no longer the owners of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2623 upon their death but that the same was acquired in 1913 by Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> and his wife, appellants' contention becomes
obviously untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last assignments of error may be discussed jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts established by the evidence, we cannot see our way
clear to ruling that the title acquired by Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>
over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2623 must be deemed to be impressed with a
"constructive trust." There would be some merit in appellants,
contention to this effect were we to hold that Lot 2623 was the property of the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Godinez</span> and
Sabina <span class="SpellE">Saberon</span> at the time of their death; that it
was afterwards inherited by<i> </i>their four children, and that Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> or his suc­cessor in interest fraudulently had it
registered in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having arrived
at the conclusion that it is not so; that, to the contrary, the property was
acquired in 1913 by Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> and his wife for
themselves, and that it was subsequently brought under the operation of our
Land Registration Act and titled in the name of Efrain C. <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>,
the theory of "con­structive trust" becomes clearly untenable.</p>
