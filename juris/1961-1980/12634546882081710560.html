				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by Alberto de la Cruz from the judgment of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
in Civil Case No. 1094 entitled "Philippine National Bank vs. Alberto de
la Cruz" of the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff,
Philippine National Bank and against defendant Alberto de la Cruz, condemning
the said defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,252.45</span>
plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum from October 23, 1959, until the said
amount is fully paid, plus 10% of the amount due as attorney's fees, and to pay
the costs of this suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant's counterclaim is hereby dis­missed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 14, 1954, to secure payment of a loan of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> evidenced by the corresponding promissory note,
appellant exe­cuted a real estate mortgage in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan was payable within one <span style="">year </span>from
the date it was granted, with interest at the rate of 6%, per annum, and an
additional 10% of the amount due as attorney's fees in case collection is judicially
enforced.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 25, 1959, due to appellant's default, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed an ordinary action with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
to recover from him the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,171.75</span>, with the
stipulated interest from April 25, 1959, plus 10% of the amount due as
attorney's fees and the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's answer to the complaint admitted the allega­tions
thereof but averred: that, as security for the payment of the loan, he had
executed a real estate mortgage in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
expressly empowering the latter to extra-judicially foreclose the same under
Act No. 3135 in case of his failure to pay the principal obligation; that,
after the filing of the action, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> foreclosed
the aforesaid mortgage, and having thus chosen such remedy, it could no longer
maintain the action for collection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant also interposed a counterclaim for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> moved to dismiss
its complaint in view of the fact that it had filed another action for the same
cause against appellant in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> (Civil Case No. 1100), but this motion was
denied by the court on the ground that the issues had already been joined.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 7, 1960, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed an
amended complaint to include in the original the allegation that, to satisfy
the mortgage debt amounting to "P5<span class="GramE">,452.45</span>,
including stipulated in­terests, the mortgaged property, in an extra-judicial
fore­closure sale under Act 3135, was sold to it as the only bidder, for the
sum of P200.00, thereby leaving <span style="">an </span>unsatisfied
balance of P5,252.45 as of October 22, 1959 which, including stipulated
interest thereon, it sought to recover from appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint was admitted and upon
appellant's failure to file an answer thereto, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
moved for a summary judgment, and on May 13, 1963, the court rendered the
appealed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only questions raised by appellant in this appeal are the
ones covered by the first assignment of error made in his brief of the
following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred <span style="">in
</span>having sustained the action of the plaintiff in foreclosing upon the pro­perty
of the defendant extra-judicially after it had <span style="">filed the present suit for the collection of the amount represented by
defendant's promissory note thereon, and in not having held instead that the
plaintiff having elected to file on July 29, 1959 an action for a sum of money,
it may not simul­taneously extra-judicially foreclose upon the mortgaged
property."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The second assignment of error is <span style="">a </span>mere corollary of the first.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that, upon the pleadings, the question
submitted to the trial court was merely this:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether <span style="">or not <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank, after </span>foreclosing extra-judicially
the mortgage executed in its favor by appellant, was still entitled <span style="">to recover the unpaid portion of the mortgage
debt which was not satisfied with the net proceeds </span>obtained <span style="">from the extra­judicial foreclosure sale of </span>the
mortgaged property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial <span style="">court upheld the bank's right and rendered
the appealed judg­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, instead of
assailing the correctness of said de­cision, appellant questions the </span>validity
<span style="">of the extra-judicial foreclosure
proceedings commenced after the filing of the present action, and the trial
court's refusal to hold that, having filed the present action on July 29, 1959
for the re­covery of the mortgage debt, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> bank
could not simul­taneously foreclose the real estate mortgage extra-judicially.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="">obvious that the
questions raised in this appeal are totally immaterial and irrelevant, and
constitute no defense to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> action to recover
the unpaid balance of its credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
appellant </span>desires <span style="">to annul the
extra­judicial foreclosure proceedings, his remedy </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">clearly not an appeal from the decision of the trial court sustaining <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> right to collect the unpaid balance of </span><span style="">the </span>loan.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>
