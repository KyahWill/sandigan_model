"Mechanical Department Labor Union <span class="SpellE">sa</span> PNR"
'for a </span>review of an order of the Court of Industrial Relations, in its
Case No. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">1475-MC, directing the holding of
a plebiscite election to determine whether </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">the employees at the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Shops desire the
respondent union, "<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;"> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Shops", to be
separated from the Mechanical </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">Department
Labor Union, with a view to the former being recognized as a </span>separate
bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">The case began on 13 February
1965 by </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">petition
of the respondent </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">"<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>,
etc." calling attention to the fact that there were </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">three unions in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
shops of the Philippine National Railways:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">“</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.7pt;">Samahan</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.7pt;">", the "<span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> Manila Railroad Company", and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">the Mechanical Department Labor Union; that no
certification election had </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">been held
in the last 12 months in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> shops; that
both <span class="SpellE">the"Samahan</span> and the Mechanical Department
Labor Union had submitted different labor </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">demands upon the management for which reason a certification election
was </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">needed to determine the proper
collective bargaining agency for the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> </span>shop
workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was opposed by the management as well as by the
Mechan<span style="letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">ical
Department Labor Union, the latter averring that it </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">had been previously </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">certified in two cases as sole and exclusive
bargaining agent of the e</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">mployees and
laborers of the <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> mechanical department, and had
nego­</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">tiated two bargaining
agreements with management in 1961 and 1963; that before the expiration of the
latter, a renewal thereof had been negotiated and the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">contract remained to be signed; that the "<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>" had been organized only in 2</span>1 January
1965; that the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> shops unit was not
established nor separate f<span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">rom the
Mechanical Department unit; that the "<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>"
is composed mainly of supervisors who had filed a pending <span style="">case </span>to be declared non-supervisors; </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">and that the purpose of the petition was to
disturb the present smooth working </span>labor management relations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">By an order of </span><st1:date month="8" day="18" year="1967"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">18 August
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">, Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Martinez, after receiving </span>the evidence, made
the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court, after a cursory examination of the evidence
presented made the following findings:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">petitioner union is composed of
workers exclusively at </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> shops of the Philippine National Railways </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">charged with the maintenance of rolling stocks for
repairs; </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">major repairs of locomotive,
engines, etc. are done in </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> shops while minor ones in the Manila sheds; </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">workers in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
shops do not leave their station </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">unlike
Manila shop workers who go out along the routes </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt;">and lines for repairs; workers both in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
shops </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">and Manila sheds are exposed
to hazards occasioned by </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">the nature of
their work; that with respect to wages and salaries of employees, categories
under the Job Classifi­cation and Evaluation Plan of the company apply to all </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">workers both in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
shops and Manila sheds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">administration over employees, members of
petitioner </span>union <span style="">as </span>well as <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> is under the <span style="">Administrative Div­<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">ision of </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">the company
that from the very nature of their work, </span>members of petitioner union and
other workers of the Mech­<span style="letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">anical Department
have been under the coverage of the current </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">collective bargaining agreement which was a result of a cer­</span>tification
by this Court of the <span style="">Mechanical </span>Department Labor <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">union,
first in 1960 and later in 1963.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, when </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">the latter
contract expired, negotiations for </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">its </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">renewal were had and at the time of the filing of
this petition was already </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.15pt;">consummated,
the only act remaining to be done was to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">affix the signatures of the parties thereto; that during the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">pendency</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;"> of this petition, on June 14, 1965, the aforesaid
</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">collective bargaining agreement was
signed between the </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.35pt;">Philippine
National Railways and the Mechanical Depart­</span>ment Labor Union <span class="SpellE">sa</span> Philippine National Railways (Manila Railroad Company).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">The main issue involved herein
is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not a </span>new unit
should be established, the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>
<u><span style="">shops</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">se­</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">parate </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">distinct from the rest of the workers under the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">Mechanical Department now represented by the
Mechanical </span>Department Labor Union.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Shops, all located at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
have 360 workers more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
part and parcel of the whole Mechanical Department of the Philippine National
Railways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The department is composed of
four main divisions or units, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Operations, Manila Area and Lines; Locomotive
Crew; </span>Motor Car Crew; and the Shops Rolling Stocks Maintenance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibits "D" and
"D-1").</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Locomotive crew and Motor Car Crew, though part of the
Mechanical Department, is a separate unit, and <span class="GramE">is</span>
represented by the Union de <span class="SpellE">Maquinistas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fogon­<span style="">eros</span></span><span style=""> </span>Y Motormen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The workers under the other two main units of
the departments are represented by the Mechan­ical Department Labor Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The workers of the Shops Rolling Stocks
Maintenance Division or the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">Shops now seek to be separated from the rest of
the </span>workers of the department and to be represented by the "<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
Shops."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is certainly a community of interest among the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">workers of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
Shops.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They are grouped in one </span>place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They work under one or same working
condition, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">same working time or schedule
and are exposed to same </span>occupational risk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Though evidence on record shows that workers at the <span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">Caloocan</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> Shops perform the same nature of work <span style="">as their </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">counterparts in the
Manila Shed, the difference lies in the </span>fact that workers at the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Shops perform major <span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">repairs of locomotives, rolling stocks, engines, etc., </span>while
those in the Manila Shed, works on minor repairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heavy equipment and machineries are found in
the <span class="SpellE">Caloo­can</span> Shops."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">The trial judge then reviewed the collective
bargaining history of the Phili</span><span style="">ppine
National Railways, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On several similar instances, this Court <span style="">allowed the </span>establishment of new and
separate bar­<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">gaining
units in one company, <u>even in one department </u></span><u>of the same
company</u>, despite the <span style="">existence of
the same </span>facts and circumstances <span style="">as
obtaining in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt;">The history of the collective
bargaining in the Manila </span>Railroad Company, now the Philippine National
Railways <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">shows that originally, there was
only one bargaining unit </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.55pt;">in the
company, represented by the <span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Mang­<span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">gagawa</span></span></span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> MRR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Case No. 237-MC, this Court <span style="">ordered the
establishment of two additional units, the </span><u><span style="">engine</span></u><span style=""> <u>crew</u> </span><span style="">and the <u>train</u>
</span><u><span style="">crew</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">to be represented by the Union de <span class="SpellE">Maquinistas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fogoneros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ayudante</span> Y Motormen <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">and
Union de <span class="SpellE">Empleados</span> de <span class="SpellE">Trenes</span>
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt;">in </span><span style="">1961, under Cases Nos. 491-MC, 494-MC and
507-MC three new separate units were established, <span style="letter-spacing: 0.6pt;">namely, the yard crew unit, station employees unit </span>and engineering
department employees unit, respect­ively, after the employees concerned voted
in a plebiscite conducted by the court for the separation from existing
bargaining units in the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
again, under Case No. 763-MC, a new unit, composed of the Mec</span><span style="">hanical </span><span style="">Department employees, was established to be represented by the
Mechanical Depart­<span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">ment Labor Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, the first attempt of </span>the
employees of the Mechanical Department to be separated </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">unit was dismissed by this Court in Case No. 488-MC.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing: 0.6pt;">In the case of the yard crew,
station employees </span>and the Engineering Department employees, the Supreme
Court sustained the order of this Court in giving the em­<span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">ployees concerned the right to vote and decide
whether </span>or <span style="">not </span>they desire
to be separate units (See G. R. No. L-16292-94, L-16309 and L-16317-18,
November, 1965)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of its findings
and the history of <span style="">union </span>representation
in the railway company, indicating that <span style="">bargaining
</span>units had been formed through <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">separation
of <span style="">new </span>units from existing ones
whenever plebiscites had shown</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;"> </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">workers' desire to have their own
representatives, and relying on the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">"Globe doctrine" (Globe Machine &amp;
Stamping </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">Co., 3 NLRB 294) applied in </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">Democratic Labor Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Stevedoring Co., G.R. No. L-10321, 28 February </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">1958, Judge Martinez held that the employees in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
Shops </span>be given a chance to vote on whether their group should be
separated from that represented by the Mechanical Department Labor Union, and
ordered <span style="letter-spacing: 0.45pt;">plebiscite held for the
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ruling was sustained by the
Court </span><u>en</u> <u>banc</u>; wherefore, the Mechanical Department Labor
Union appealed to </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">Court, questioning the applicability under
the circumstances of the "Globe doctrine" of considering the will of
the employees in determining what should represent them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Technically, this appeal
is premature, since the result of the ordered plebiscite among the workers of
the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> shops may be adverse to the <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">formation of a separate unit, in which event, as
stated in the appealed order </span>all questions raised in this case would be
rendered moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Apparently, however,
the appellant Mechanical </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Department
Labor Union <span class="GramE">take</span></span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;"> </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">for granted that the
plebiscite would favor separation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no grave abuse of
discretion <span style="">in the </span>issuance of
the ruling under appeal </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">would justify our interfering with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 875 has primarily entrusted
the prosecution of <span style="">its policies to the
Court of Industrial R<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">elations, and, in view
of its intimate knowledge concerning the </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">facts and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">circumstances surrounding the cases brought before it, this Court has </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">re</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">peatedly upheld the exercise </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">of discretion of the Court of <span style="">Industrial </span>Rela</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">tions in matters concerning the <span style="">representation of employee groups (Manila </span></span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">Paper Mills Employees &amp; Workers' Association <span style="">vs. </span>C. I. R., 104 Phil. </span>10; <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated </span><span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bobok</span></span><span style=""> Lumber Jack Association, 103 Phil. 1150).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Appellant contends that the application of the
"Globe doctrine" is not <span style="letter-spacing: 0.7pt;">warranted
because the workers of the </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="letter-spacing: 0.7pt;">Caloocan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="letter-spacing: 0.7pt;"> shops do not require </span><span style="">different skills
from the rest of the workers in </span><span style="">the
Mechanical Department of the Railway Company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This question is primarily one of fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="">In<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">dustrial Court</span></span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;"> has found that there is
a basic difference, in that those in </span><span style="">the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caloocan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> shops not only have </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">community of interest and working conditions
but perform major repairs of railway rolling stock, using heavy equipment and
machineries found in said shops, while the others only<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">perform minor repairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to understand, therefore, that the
workers </span>in the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caloocan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> shops require special skill in <span style="">the use </span>of heavy equipment <span style="letter-spacing: 0.3pt;">and machinery sufficient to set them apart from the
rest of the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In addition,
the record shows that the collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the
appellant union have been in existence for more than </span>two (2) years;
hence, such agreements can not constitute a bar to the deter<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">mination by proper elections, of a <span style="">new bargaining</span></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> re</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">presentative

some of the members of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, "<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>", are
actually supervisors, <span style="">it appears that </span>the
question of the status of such members <span style="">is
still pending final decision; hence, </span></span><span style="">it </span><span style="">would <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">not
constitute <span style="">a legal obstacle to the
holding </span>of the plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate </span>the appellant may later question whether <span style="">the votes </span>of those ultimately </span>declared to be supervisors
should be counted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
