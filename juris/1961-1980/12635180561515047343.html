				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal taken by the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from the order issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila, presided by the
Honorable Agustin P. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>, in Civil Case No.
47737, reconsidering its decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="3">March
 14, 1963</st1:date> and providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds that the petitioner possesses all
the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a Filipino
citizen under the existing laws, for which his petition is hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of naturalization, however,
shall not issue until after the expiration of the period of two years from and
after the date of the promulgation of this decision and only after hearing at
which he shall establish the final conditions required for Philippine
citizenship."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">chinese</span></span> citizen, filed a petition
for naturalization in the abovementioned court on <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same was subsequently amended so as to include a statement of the different
places in which <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had resided before the
filing of his application.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the evidence, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was
born on <st1:date year="1918" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1918</st1:date>
in <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quemoy</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having come to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1936 he was allowed thereafter to stay as a permanent resident as the son of
a merchant then engaged in selling second hand goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since his arrival he had resided in the
following addresses and for the period stated correspondingly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For 2 months after arrival at <span class="SpellE">Espeleta</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city></blockquote>

<blockquote>From 1936 to 1950, at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place></blockquote>

<blockquote>From 1950 to 1951, at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Quiniones</span>
  St.</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address></blockquote>

<blockquote>From 1951 to 1955, at 360 T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city></blockquote>

<blockquote>From 1955 to <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1959</st1:date>,
at 648, T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">From </span><st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 20, 1959</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">

<p class="BODY">The evidence further shows that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was employed for the first time in 1936 as a salesman at a monthly salary of
P30.00, increased to P120.00 a month in 1941; that during the <span class="SpellE">japanese</span> occupation he engaged himself in gardening and
poultry raising; that after liberation he engaged himself in the business of
buying and selling rice, corn, etc.; that when his father left the Philippines
in 1939 he gave him the sum of P5,000.00 which he invested together with his
savings and thus became a partner in the Kim San Company organized in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City to engage in general merchandising; that his
original investment in said Company was P16,000.00; that he received from said
Company, as its representative in Manila, a monthly salary of P300.00; that in
addition thereto he received dividends whenever the Company realized profits;
that in the years 1959 and 1960 he did not pay any income tax because he was
exempt <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; that his income for 1961 amounted
to P15,000.00; that his present capital investment in Kim San Company was
P45,000.00; that on June 6, 1948 he married Lo Eh <span class="SpellE">Biao</span>,
a <span class="SpellE">chinese</span> woman born in Amoy, China on September 17,
1929 and who had come to the Philippines as a quota immigrant on August 8,
1947, with whom he had six children living with him at 630 T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span>, Manila; that his children are enrolled as students
in Crusaders' Academy, <span class="SpellE">Letran</span> College; that he
himself was at the time he testified studying at the Loyal Hearts Institute
where he finished his elementary education; that before coming to the
Philippines he had studied in China, and that in 1937 he had studied in a <span class="SpellE">chinese</span> school in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>; that
since his arrival in the Philippines he had gone abroad twice on vacation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> filed his declaration of
intention with the office of the Solicitor General on <st1:date year="1960" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also presented as evidence clearances of the City Fiscal, the Court
of First Instance and the Municipal Court of Manila, the Bureau of Prisons, the
Deportation Board, the Anti-Dummy Board, the Bureau of Immigration, the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, the office of the City
Fiscal and the Police Department of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City,
together with a medical certificate showing that he was not suffering from any
incurable contagious disease.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> character witnesses were <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> R. Pacheco and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
J. <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, residents of No. 52, 7th <st1:address><st1:street>Guillermo
  Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:city></st1:address>,
and <st1:street><st1:address>17 <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Para√±aque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General opposed the petition on the following
grounds:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>"THAT PETITIONER IS NOT SINCERE IN HIS DESIRE TO BECOME A
FILIPINO CITIZEN; AND</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE WITNESSES TO THE PETITION HAVE NOT PROVED THAT PETITIONER
HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN A PROPER AND IRREPROACHABLE MANNER DURING THE ENTIRE
PERIOD OF HIS RESIDENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES OR THAT PETITIONER HAS ALL THE
QUALIFICATIONS NECESSARY TO BECOME A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES AND IS NOT IN
ANY WAY DISQUALIFIED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE REVISED NATURALIZATION
LAW." <span class="GramE">(p. 13. rec. on appeal).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had filed a reply, the
Court heard the case and on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="3">March 14,
 1963</st1:date> rendered a decision denying <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
petition holding that he is "not qualified to become a Filipino
citizen".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed a motion for reconsideration and for the reopening of the case to enable
him to present evidence regarding his sincerity to become a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and to further qualify his character witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of the Government's opposition, the
trial court reconsidered its decision, reopened the case and after the
reception of additional evidence, issued the order appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied with said order, the State
interposed the present appeal, claiming that the trial court committed the
following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>PETITIONER IS NOT SINCERE IN HIS DESIRE TO BECOME A FILIPINO
CITIZEN.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">THE WITNESSES TO THE PETITION ARE NOT IN A
POSITION TO VOUCH FOR PETITIONER'S GOOD REPUTATION AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT.</span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE PETITION FOR
NATURALIZATION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the record, We have come to the conclusion
that the order appealed from must be reversed on the strength of the second
assignment of error which puts in issue the capacity of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
character witnesses "to vouch for petitioner's good reputation and
irreproachable conduct".</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires that the
petition for naturalization must be signed by the applicant and be supported by
the affidavit of at least two <u>credible</u> persons stating that they are
citizens of the Philippines and personally know petitioner to be a resident of
the Philippines for a period of time required by law, and that he is a person
of good repute and morally irreproachable; that in their opinion petitioner has
all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a citizen of
the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held in connection with the above legal provision that a
"credible person" is not merely an individual without a previous
conviction of a crime; who is not a police character and has no police record;
who has not perjured in the past or whose affidavit or testimony is not
incredible (Mo Yuen <span class="SpellE">Tsi</span> vs. Republic, G. R. L-17137,
June 29, 1962) but must be a person with a good standing in the community,
reputed to be trustworthy and reliable, whose word may be taken on its face value
as a good warranty of the integrity and trustworthiness of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In as much as the matter of presenting at least "two
credible persons" as witnesses is a legal requirement for the sufficiency
of petitioner's case, it is clear that it is incumbent upon him to establish
affirmatively that his character witnesses are "credible persons" in
the sense above indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that
in this connection petitioner has failed to discharge this burden.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is not clear from the record that petitioner's
character witnesses - <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> Pacheco and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> - were in a
position to vouch for his qualifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pacheco testified that he came to know petitioner for the first
time in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City when he went there in 1946 as
salesman of the Tide Water Associated Oil Company; that he met him the second
time in September 1947 in the offices of the William Lines; that from 1949 to
the time he ceased to be the assistant manager of the William Lines nine years
later, he used to see petitioner regularly every two days at his residence in
T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span> St., Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be observed in connection with Pacheco's testimony is the fact
that he had disclosed no reason why for a period of several years he saw
petitioner regularly every two days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, Pacheco's testimony that from 1949 to nine years later (1958)
<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> residence was located at T. <span class="SpellE">Pinpin</span> St., Manila, does not tally with petitioner's
allegation in his petition that he resided in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City from 1936 to 1950 (p. 7, record on appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to witness <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, the
record shows that he did not know anything about <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
reputation in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> because he did not meet him
there, most of his meetings with him having taken place in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that whenever he visited <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, he went direct to the latter's apartment and had
never talked with any of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> neighbors regarding
his reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that he had
seen <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from three to five times on board a
ship of the William Lines plying between <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and
Manila during the period from 1949 to 1953 where he was a purser; that for
sometime <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had resided in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
residence in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> is not
mentioned in his amended petition for naturalization as one of his former
residences.</p>

<p class="BODY">To qualify as a good character witness within the meaning of the
law, and for testimony given as such to be sufficient to support the petition
for naturalization, one must not be a mere acquaintance of the petitioner but
must possess such intimate knowledge of him as to be competent to vouch for his
qualifications and his lack of disqualifications (Cuaki Tan Si vs. Republic,
G.R. No. L-18006, <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1962</st1:date>;
Go vs. Republic, G. R. No. L-18068, October 30, 1962) because he is the insurer
of petitioner's character and his testimony is to be heavily relied upon by the
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that, as shown by
the foregoing, the character witnesses of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> do
not satisfy the standard required, the order appealed from must be, as it is
hereby, reversed, with costs.</p>
