				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal, two
issues involving questions of law are posed for resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, whether or not the allegations in the
complaint constitute a cause of action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>,
and confer jurisdiction over the case to the municipal court (now city court)
of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, under the pro<span style="">visions of Rule </span>70<span style=""> </span>of the Rules of Court and decisions
interpreting the same, when particularly considered in the light of the
contexture of the pertinent letter of demand to vacate the <span style="">leased premises (Annex </span>J of the
Complaint), couched in the following wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Please be advised further that we reiterate our demand made
to you in our registered letter dated February 4, 1959 (to vacate the leased
premises) which was received by you on the 10th instant, unless you pay the
amount of Six Hundred pesos, (P600.00) or Seven hundred pesos (P700.00) as new
rental per our let<span style="">ter of January 19,
1959, before the expiration of the 15-day period granted you for vacating the
same."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">and</span></span><span style="">, Second,
whether or not the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the lessee had agreed
upon an <u>automatic</u> <u>renewal</u> of the lease of the premises, under the
stipulation in clause "7" of the corresponding contract of lease,
containing the following agreement:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"7. - That upon the termination of the term of Ten (10) years
above expressed, the said <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.

the said <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Chan, and the price of said building

appointed by each of the parties, and the remainder commissioner shall be appointed

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Murga</span> was the owner of two
parcels of land in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
designated as lots 36 and 38 of the cadastral plan of the place, and <span style="">covered by Transfer Certificate of Title Nos.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon taking possession of

the lessee introduced improvements on the land consisting of buildings of the

period of the lease, there had been in­tercourse of communications between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the lessee for the renewal of the lease, but the
parties failed to arrive at an Agreement; hence, this action by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> against the lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1958" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1958</st1:date>,

of the monthly rental corresponding to the month of February, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Exhibit J.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 19, 1959, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
returned to the lessee the check which the latter had sent to the for­mer,
stating further in the letter that she was demand­ing that the leased premises
be vacated, if he (<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>) would not agree to pay the
new rental of P600.00 or P700.00 a month beginning February 1, 1959, as
embodied in the letter, Exhibit J, hereinabove quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disregarding the written demand of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
dated February 19, 1959, Exhibit J, the lessee chose to remain in the
possession of the leased premises and insisted that the contract of lease
stipulated an automa­tic renewal of the lease, and conformably thereto, he has
a right to continue occupying the premises; and as token of his decision, he
sent to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> his check for P500.00 in payment
of the monthly rent correspond­ing to the month of February 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> was
undoubtedly not satisfied with the tendered amount of P500.00, because she had
demanded P600.00 or P700.00, <span style="">as </span>new monthly rent as a condition for the renewal of the
lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And without any further <u>definite</u>
demand on the lessee to vacate the premises filed, on March 10, 1959, a
complaint of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> in the municipal court
of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City against the lessee, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Chan, to eject the latter from the leased
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts alleged in the
complaint as cause of action, con­sisted in reproducing and reiterating the
substance of the correspondence exchanged between <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and lessee, as narrated above, and claiming that the possession of the lessee
of the premises had become illegal by his failure and refusal to pay the
increased new rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For relief, the
plaintiff prayed that the defendant be ordered to vacate the premises, and
"TO PAY THE NEW RENTS DEMANDED OF P600.00 or P700.00 FROM <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="2">FEBRUARY 1, 1959</st1:date> MONTHLY AS THE CASE
MAY BE." <span class="GramE">Attached to the com­plaint, as annexes thereto,
were copies of the letters exchanged between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and the lessee, Exhibits B to J.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his answer (as
amended), the defendant admitting the genuineness and authenticity of the
letters annexed to the complaint, but traversing some of the allegations
therein, raised the defenses of lack of jurisdiction of the court over the
case, and lack of </span>cause of action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span style="">a </span>trial, decision was rendered ordering the defendant to vacate
the premises, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P600.00 as monthly rent from <st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1959</st1:date>, and P500.00 as
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant appealed from the decision to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before this Court, the defendant again raised
the special de­fenses of lack of jurisdiction of the municipal court and lack
of cause of action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruling on the issue of lack of jurisdiction,
the court said:</p>

<blockquote>"With reference to the contention of defendant that the
municipal court had no jurisdiction to try this case because the interpretation,
applica­tion and enforcement of the terms of the Lease Agreement <span class="GramE"><span style="">is</span></span><span style=""> </span>within the <span style="">competence of a court higher than that of the
municipal court, deserves hardly any discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that the jurisdiction of
the municipal court is grounded on Section 88 of the Judiciary Act of
1948."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a trial, the Court of First Instance rend­ered judgment
ordering the defendant to vacate the <span style="">premises,
</span><span style="">to pay the plaintiff the sum of
P1<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> from </span><st1:date year="1959" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February 1, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">, as monthly rental of the land, and P2,000.00
as attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From </span>the foregoing
decision, the defendant interposed a direct appeal to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, only questions of law may be
considered in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the four errors assigned by the appellant in his brief, the
first two pose the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the municipal court and of
the lack of cause of <span style="">action </span>for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>; the remaining errors <span style="">delving </span>on
questions of fact which, by reason of the nature of <span style="">the </span>appeal are, therefore, denied ad­mitted and may not be
reviewed in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In relation to the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the municipal
court over the case, it is to be noted that, after the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
and the lessee had failed to agree on the renewal of the lease which terminated
on <st1:date year="1959" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1959</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="2">February
 19, 1959</st1:date>, sent the demand letter hereinabove quoted, Exhibit
J.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, then, as it is now, the
contention <span style="">of </span>the lessee that
such demand is not that kind of demand contemplated in the Rules of Court as
complying with the jurisdict­ional requirement - that demand to vacate is
indispen<span style="">sable in order to determine
whether the tenant's posses­sion has beco</span>m<span style="">e illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this matter, the
rulings in the following </span><span style="">cases <span style="">are </span></span><span style="">pertinent and applicable:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The notice giving lessee the alter­native either to pay the
increased ren­<span style="">tal
or otherwise to vacate </span>the land <span style="">is </span>not the demand contemplated by the Rules
of Court in unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> <span style="">cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When after such notice,
the lessee elects to stay, he thereby mere­ly assumes the new rental and cannot
be ejected until he defaults in said obligation and necessary demand </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">first made." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Manotok</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Guinto</span></span><span style="">, L-­9540, </span>April 30, 1957.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may, under Article 1569
of the <span style="">Civil </span>Code, judicially
dispossess the lessee for default in the payment of the price agreed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">But </span>where
such default is based on the fact that the rent sought to be collected is not
the agreed upon, an action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cannot lie."
(<span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> vs. Martin, 42 <span class="GramE">Of</span>.
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Gaz</span></span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">. </span>No. 10,
2146.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the case at
bar, it clearly appears from the de­mand letter of <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1959</st1:date>, that the obligation to vacate
the leased premises would be dependent on the failure of the lessee to agree to
the new rent demanded by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the lessee, however, was in the physi­cal
possession of the land by virtue of a prior contract of <span style="">lease, </span>and the demand was in the alternative imposing a new
rental, even without taking <span style="">into
account the effi­</span>cacy of the stipulation for an automatic renewal of the
lease, which shall be discussed hereafter, in the light of the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> vs. Martin, <u>supra</u>, without any subsequent <u>definite</u>
demand to vacate the premises, subject to no condition, the lessee did not
incur in default which would give rise to a right on the part of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to bring an action of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Delving on the second special defense to wit, that the
allegations in the complaint do not constitute <span style="">a </span>cause of action of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, it <span style="">is </span>the
conten­tion of the lessee-appellant that clause '7' of the contract of lease,
quoted hereinabove, meant an express grant to the lessee to renew the lease at
his option, contrary to the claim of the <span class="SpellE">lessor-appellee</span>
that there must be a prior mutual agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we read clause '7',<span style=""> We </span>find that it envisioned the happen­ing
of two eventualities at <span style="">the expiration
of the lease </span>on January 31, 1959 - either the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
may purchase the improvements constructed by the lessee on the land, or in case
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> fails, for any cause or reason, to exer­cise
the option to buy, the lease shall be deemed auto­matically renewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence has established that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> had refused to buy the buildings on the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement in said clause '7' <span style="">t</span>hat in case of renewal the duration
of the lease and the new rental to be paid shall be adjusted by the parties, <span style="">is </span>of no moment in the solution of the
issue, whether or not the facts alleged in the complaint constitute a cause of
action of unlaw­ful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pleadings of the <span class="GramE">parties,</span>
and the annexes thereto, <span style="">clearly </span>show
that the jugular vein of the controversy hinges on the <span style="">correct interpretation of </span>clause '7' of the contract of lease, a
matter outside the jurisdiction of the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor-appellee</span>
maintains that <span style="">lease
</span>had terminated on January 31, 1959, renewable only upon a new agreement
of the parties; on the other hand, the lessee-appellant contends that, inasmuch
as the controversy hinges on the interpretation <span style="">of </span><span style="">clause </span><span style="">'7' of the contract, that </span><span style="">is, </span>whether
or <span style="">not said </span>clause contemplated
an automatic renewal of the lease, the action was not for unlawful <span class="SpellE">de­tainer</span> but one not capable of pecuniary estimation and, <span style="">therefore, </span>beyond the competence of
the municipal court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the lessee-appellant must be sus­tained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Cruz vs. Alberto, 39 Phil. 991, the contract of lease had the
following provision:</p>

<blockquote>"That the term of this contract of <span style="">lease </span>shall be <span style="">six </span>years
from the date of the execution, and ex­tendible for another six years agreed
upon by both parties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was contended </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> that the <span style="">lease </span>cannot <span style="">be </span>extended
except upon mutual agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruling on
the contention, the Supreme Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"We </span>are of the
opinion that the trial judge was entirely correct in his interpretation of the
contracts in question; and though it must be admitted that this interpretation
renders the words 'agreed upon by both parties' superfluous, yet this does not
involve any strain upon the meaning of the entire passage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the interpretation which the appellant
would have us adopt be true, the entire clause relative to the extension of the
term would he superfluous, for if the extension is only to b<span style="">e </span>effective upon a new agreement of
the parties to be made at the expiration of the original term, why should
anything at all be said about an extension?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parties who are free to make one contract of lease are certainly free to
make a new one when the old has expired without being reminded of their faculty
to do so by the insertion of a clause of this kind <span style="">in </span>the first lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
would not only be superfluous but nonsensical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The clause relative to the extension of the lease should, if possible,
be so interpreted as to give it some force.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As we interpret the contracts be­fore us, the parties meant
to express the fact that they had already agreed that there might be an
extension of <span style="">the lease and had agreed
upon its du­ration, thus giving the defendant the right of election to take for
a second term or to quit upon the expiration of the original term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clause in ques­tion has the same meaning
as if the words "agreed upon by both parties" had been omitted and
the passage had closed with a period after the word 'years' </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the first contract and after "extension" in the third
contract.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been held by this court that the word 'extendible'
standing without qualification in a contract of <span class="GramE">lease,</span>
means that the term of the lease may be extended and is equivalent to a promise
to extend, made by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to the lessee, and, as
unilateral stipulation, obliges the <span class="SpellE">promisor</span> to
fulfill his pro­mise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ongsiako</span>, 36 Phil. <span style="">Rep.
185).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a stipulation is support­ed by the
consideration which is at the basis of the contract of lease (16 R.C.L. pp.
883, 884) and obviously involves a mutuality of benefit, </span><span style="">or reciprocity </span><span style="">between </span><span style="">the parties, </span><span style="">notwithstanding the </span><span style="">right
of election is conceded solely to the lessee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a general rule, in cons­truing provisions of this character, the
tenant is favored, where there is any uncertainty, and not the landlord, upon
the principle that a grant should be taken most strongly against the grantor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(15 R.C.L. p. 884 24 <span class="SpellE">Cyc</span>.</span> 915.)"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span>, 36 Phil. 189-190, the contract of lease had this
provision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The term of the said contract shall be for one year, counting
from the 1st of December of the present year (1963) which term shall be
extendible at the will of both parties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Said the Supreme Court:</p>

<blockquote>"According to Article 1091 of the Civil Code, obligations
arising from contracts have legal force between the contracting parties and
must be fulfilled in accordance with their stipulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore if the de­fendant bound himself to
lease his properties for the period of one year, which term should be
extendible, it is evident and strictly in accord <span style="font-size: 12pt;">with justice that the plaintiff-lessee has a right,
the termination of the first period of one year, to have the said contract of
lease renewed in fulfillment of the </span>stipulated extension of the term of
the lease; otherwise, the clause contained in the document Exhibit 1, that the
lease at its ter­mination would be extendible, would be worthless."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant-appellant is wrong in his contention that the
renewal or extension of the contract depended solely upon himself,
notwithstanding the stipulations contained in said contract, inasmuch as the
renewal and continuation of the lease could not be left wholly to the
plaintiff's free will, without counting on the defend­ant's consent - a consent
expressly granted in the promise that the term would be extended, which term,
although its duration was not fixed, should be understood to be for another
year, a period equal to and not greater than the term of the lease.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When a contract of lease provides that the term thereof is
extendible, the agreement is understood as being in favor of the lessee, and
the latter is authorized to renew the contract and to continue to occupy the
leased property, after notifying the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to that
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
can withdraw from the said contract only after having fulfilled his promise to
grant the extension of time stipulated therein, unless the lessee has failed to
comply with or has violated the conditions of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary that the extension be
expressly conceded by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> because he consented
thereto in the original contract."</blockquote>
