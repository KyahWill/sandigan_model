<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an appeal by the Republic 
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> from the decision of the Court 
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span>, granting the petition for 
naturalization filed by Luis Yap, a Chinese citizen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The records show that the 
requirements to confer jurisdiction on the lower court to hear the petition had 
been complied with. The evidence shows that the petitioner was born in the city 
of <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span> on May 27, 1937, the legitimate son of Ho Ye 
and Yap <span class="SpellE">Peng</span>, both citizens of the Republic of 
Nationalist China; that the petitioner has been residing in the city of <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span> although he is employed in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City as a teacher in the <span class="SpellE">Samantabhadra</span> Institute; that he finished his elementary and 
secondary education at the Sun <span class="SpellE">Yat</span> <span class="SpellE">Sen</span> High School of <span class="SpellE">lloilo</span> City, a 
school that is open to any race or nationality and where Philippine history, 
Philippine government and civics are taught; that as a teacher in the <span class="SpellE">Samantabhadra</span> Institute he received a monthly salary of 
P200.00 from June 1, 1958 to March 31, 1959; P220.00 monthly from June 1, 1960 
to March 31, 1961; and P200.00 monthly from June 1, 1961 to March 31, 1962; that 
while in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> he is living in the house of his cousin, 
another Chinese, for being a tutor to the children of his host; that he is 
single, and that aside from his salary as a teacher he has no other source of 
income; that he owns no real property; that he has resided in the Philippines 
continuously since his birth. The evidence further shows that the petitioner 
speaks the English language and the <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span> dialect 
that he believes in the principles underlying the Philippine constitution and 
has conducted himself properly during the entire period of his residence in the 
Philippines in his relations with the duly constituted authorities and the 
community where he lives, and that he had mingled socially with the Filipinos; 
that he has no criminal record; that he is in good health; that he paid his 
taxes to the government; that he is not opposed to any organized government nor 
is he affiliated with any association that upholds and teaches the doctrine of 
opposition against organized government and that he does not believe in the 
necessity of violence, intimidation, personal assault or assassination for the 
success and predominance of his ideas; and that he is not a polygamist. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The petitioner presented two 
character witnesses, namely: Mr. Jose Villanueva <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>, 
an instructor in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Colleges</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">; and Mrs. Ramona Fuentes, a 
teacher in the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sun</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Yat</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sen</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">School</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. Both witnesses testified that 
they had known the petitioner closely for over ten years and they vouched for 
his good conduct and good moral character. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon the evidence presented 
during the hearing, the lower court declared that the petitioner has all the 
qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a Filipino citizen as 
provided in the Naturalization Law. The court thereby declared the petitioner 
eligible for naturalization as Filipino citizen and that he may qualify as such 
after the lapse of two years after the promulgation of said decision. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this appeal the Solicitor 
General points out that the lower court committed errors in its decision: (1) in 
finding that the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has all the 
qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided in the naturalization 
law; (2) in not finding that the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> 
conduct is not irreproachable; and (3) in finding that the two attesting 
witnesses have established that the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is qualified and not disqualified to a citizen of 
the Philippines. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Solicitor General discussed 
jointly the three errors that he has assigned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Solicitor General contends 
that the petitioner is not qualified for admission to Philippine citizenship 
because at the time of the hearing of this petition he did not have a lucrative 
employment. We find the contention of the Solicitor General to be meritorious. 
The evidence shows that at the time of the hearing in December 1961, the 
petitioner was employed as teacher in the <span class="SpellE">Samantabhadra</span> Institute in 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> with a monthly salary of 
P200.00. It was established that as such school teacher he was paid his salary 
only during the school year; that is, from June 1 of each year to March 31 of 
the following year. It can be said, therefore, that the petitioner was actually 
getting paid only for a period of ten months every year. It results that the 
annual income of the petitioner as of the time when this case was heard in the 
court below was only P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, or at the rate of 
P166.00 a month. Even if it is to be considered, as the petitioner had tried to 
prove, that as such teacher he was living with a cousin in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and was not paying for board and lodging because he was 
at the same time a tutor of the children of his cousin, still it cannot be 
considered that petitioner had a lucrative income as would qualify him for 
admission to Philippine citizenship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Considering the high cost of 
living that has been prevailing, which cost of living had tended to increase 
rather than to decrease, and considering further the low buying Power of the 
Philippine currency, this Court has, in recent decisions, adopted a higher 
standard in determining whether a petitioner for Philippine citizenship has a 
lucrative income as would qualify him for admission to Philippine citizenship. 
Two cases that had been decided by Court recently are squarely applicable to the 
present of the petitioner. <span class="GramE">In the case of Albert <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Lin Chuan vs. Republic of the 
</span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, G. R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-18550, 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 28, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
this Court denied the petition for Philippine citizenship of petitioner who was 
single and was employed in the Cosmos Industrial Co. with a salary of P200.00 a 
month with free board and lodging. <span class="GramE">Again, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> Chet alias <span class="SpellE">Hianchit</span> S. Chua 
vs. Republic of the </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, G. R. 
No.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> L-17223, 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1964"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 30, 
1964</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
this Court denied the petition for Philippine citizenship of the petitioner who 
was single and was employed as purchaser and salesman in the store of his mother 
with a monthly salary of P200.00. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On the ground, therefore, that 
the petitioner, Luis Yap, did not have a lucrative income as of the time the 
petition was heard in the court below, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with 
the Solicitor General that the lower court erred in finding that the petitioner 
had all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become Filipino 
citizen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not consider it necessary 
to discuss the other points raised by the Solicitor General in the discussion of 
his assignment of errors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF THE 
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
