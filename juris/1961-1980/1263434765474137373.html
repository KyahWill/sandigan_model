<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent National Housing Corporation (NHC) was formed, with an authorized
capital of P100,000.00, and with respondents Benjamin del Rosario, Gregorio S. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>,
Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Esteban <span class="SpellE">Bernido</span>,
as respective heads of the GSIS, DBP, PNB, SSS and PHHC, as incorporators and
subscribers to shares of the capital stock of the firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The primary purpose of the corporation was to
assist in and coordinate the massive low-cost housing program of the
Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 15, 1968, its capitalization was increased to P100
million, with the Social Security System (SSS), <span style="">the Government Service insurance System (GSIS), the Philippine National
Bank (PNB), and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) subscribing to
P19,980,000.00 worth of shares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1968</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> assigned his shares (or subscriptions) to the
SSS; <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bernido</span>
assigned theirs to the NIDC and PHHC on <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="8">August
 8, 1968</st1:date>, respectively; del Rosario assigned his rights to the GSIS
sometime in August, 1968; while <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> assigned his
subscriptions to the DBP on an unspecified date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1968</st1:date>,
NHC entered into a contract with respondent Hildebrand <span class="SpellE">Maschinehandel</span>,
GMDH (Hildebrand, for short), a German corporation, for <span style="">the supply of machinery and equipment for an integrated plant for the
manufacture of low-cost homes and school buildings, at the total price of DM
64,000,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioner Ramon A. Gonzales filed a Complaint against respondents before the
Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 7587 for annulment of the
Hildebrand contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that he
was suing as a taxpayer; that said contract was null and void on the ground
that NHC, being a government-controlled corporation, was illegally created
since it was organized under a general law, the Corporation Law, instead of a
special act of Congress as provided for by the Constitution; that the creation
of the NHC violates the Anti-Graft Law and is against public policy; that the DBP,
SSS, and the GSIS are without power to invest in NHC; that NHC, being a void
corporation, is without authority to enter into contracts, hence, the
Hildebrand contract is void and unenforceable; that respondents del Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bernido</span> are jointly
and severally liable in their personal capacities for the refund of payments
made under said contract; and that petitioner has been compelled to come to
Court to protect the interests of taxpayers and is entitled to attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that prior to the filing of the aforementioned
Complaint, or on <st1:date year="1969" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1969</st1:date>,
petitioner had already filed before this Court a Petition for Prohibition with
Preliminary Injunction (G. R. No. L-30080) wherein petitioner prayed that the
creation of the NHC be declared null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was dismissed in the Resolution of this Court dated
February 1, 1969, with the statement that the proper remedy, under the facts
alleged in the Petition, being <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record also discloses
that on February 24, 1969, upon instructions of the President, the Solicitor
General had filed a petition for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Branch (Civil Case No. 11583, entitled Republic of
the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, et al.), directly
putting in issue the legality or illegality of the creation of the NHC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently not satisfied with the filing of the foregoing suits,
petitioner filed the present taxpayer's action on <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their special and affirmative defenses, respondents alleged
that the NHC is a private corporation and that its funds are not public funds;
that the Hildebrand contract does not involve expenditure of public funds which
can be enjoined in a taxpayer's suit; that what is purportedly a suit for
"annulment of a contract with preliminary injunction" is actually a
reiteration of the grounds alleged and arguments adduced in the Petition for
Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction filed in the above-mentioned G.R. No.
L-30080; and, finally, that the present suit is barred by the prior action for <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> (Civil Case No. 11583, <u>supra</u>),
pending before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, directly attacking the corporate existence of
NHC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of counterclaim, respondents
asked for moral damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1970</st1:date>,
the trial Court rendered a Decision dismissing petitioner's Complaint on the
principal grounds that the special civil action for Prohibition with
Preliminary Injunction (G.R. No. L-30080) constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>; and that the suit for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> (Civil Case No. 11583) constitutes a
"prejudicial question" that must first be resolved before an action
for annulment of the Hildebrand <span style="">contract
can </span>be filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the counterclaim for damages, the trial Court
dismissed the same believing that the zeal of a citizen as a taxpayer,
howsoever irritating and vexatious it may be, should not be discouraged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents appealed the dismissal of their counterclaim to the
Court of Appeals and on "questions of both fact and law".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved to dismiss on the ground
that since only questions of law are involved in the appeal, the same should
have been elevated to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals deferred ruling thereon until judgment on the
merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before the appellate
tribunal, respondents attributed the following errors to the trial Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in ruling that the instant case is simply a representative
suit filed by a taxpayer against public officials and government entities;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in not finding that the instant case is clearly unfounded
civil action or proceeding against herein defendants-appellants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in not awarding attorney's fees and cost of litigation to
the herein defendants-appellants.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1978, the Court of Appeals handed down its Decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> modifying that of the trial Court by awarding
respondents attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00 and litigation expenses
in the sum of P1,000.00 and costs, upon a finding that petitioner's case is
"without any proper basis or foundation and therefore clearly
unfounded." Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of that Decision was
denied on <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A Petition for Review before us was filed by petitioner on <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1979</st1:date> alleging that the Court
of Appeals had erred in assuming jurisdiction as only a question of law is
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an Amended Petition for
Review, he alleged additionally that the Court of Appeals had erred in granting
respondents' claim for attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation and reversing
the trial Court on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1979, after requiring respondents to submit their
Comment, with which they have complied, we resolved to give limited due course
only in so far as attorney's fees and litigation expenses awarded by the Court
of Appeals are concerned, dispensed with the submittal of Briefs and Memoranda,
and declared the case submitted for decision on said issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Partial due course only was given as we were of the opinion that
the Court of Appeals had correctly <span style="">assumed
jurisdiction inasmuch as mixed questions of fact and law were raised by
respondents in their appeal to the Court of Appeals as embodied in the
assignments of error which they had raised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question of whether or not there was fraudulent or deceitful intent
or malice in the institution of the case so as to entitle respondents to
damages, is a question of fact.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The reasonableness of attorney's fees is
likewise a question of fact.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> These are questions of fact as they call for
an examination of the probative value of the evidence of parties litigants as
contrasted to questions of law, which do not call for such examination of probative
value of evidence but raise doubt or difference of opinion as to what the law
is on a certain state of facts.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have held in various
cases that fraud cannot be presumed, and it must be established by clear and
sufficient evidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We have also held that there is need of some
proof as to the amount of attorney's fees</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to be granted by a Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the foregoing
considerations, we find merit in petitioner's contention that attorney's fees
were erroneously awarded by the appellate Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in the case of Herrera vs. <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> Kim Guan,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in the absence of stipulation, a winning
party may be awarded attorney's fees only in case plaintiff's action or
defendant's stand is so untenable as to amount to gross and evident bad
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the complaint was filed in
good faith, attorney's fees cannot be granted to the defendants simply because
the judgment was favorable to them, for that may amount to imposing a premium
on the right to redress grievances in Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, we find no sufficient showing of bad faith in petitioner's
having filed this taxpayer's suit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's persistence could, perhaps, be attributed more to erroneous
conviction on his part in the righteousness of his cause rather than an act of
harassment or vexation against respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, in so far
as it upheld the decision of the trial Court dismissing respondents' appeal, is
hereby affirmed; but in so far as it awarded attorney's fees and expenses of
litigation to private respondents, it is hereby reversed and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
