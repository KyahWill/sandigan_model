				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of First
Instance of Negros Occidental </span><span style="">dismissed
</span><span style="">plaintiff's complaint,
reproduced </span><span style="">therein on appeal by
defendant from a judgment rendered against the latter by the municipal court of
Bacolod City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff in turn appealed
directly to us from the order of dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The action was for
recovery of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">municipal court sentenced defendant to pay P</span><span style="">3,200, </span><span style="">with interest, attorney<span style="">'</span></span><span style="">s</span><span style="">
</span><span style="">fees </span><span style="">and costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both parties adopted their respective pleadings in the Court of First
Instance, and the case was set for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After several postponements and some </span><span style="">six </span><span style="">months following the
perfection of the appeal, plaintiff moved to dismiss the same on the ground
that it had been filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Specifically, it was alleged that </span><span style="">copy </span><span style="">of the decision, of
the municipal court was posted </span><span style="">in
the mail on January 3, 1962, addressed to </span>defendant's counsel, and that
the appeal was perfected a<span style="">fter </span><span style="">the lapse of the </span><span style="">reglementary period of fifteen days </span>ther<span style="">eafter, or on </span><span style="">January 30, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss the appeal was denied
by the Court of First Instance, which </span><span style="">found that although, notice of the registered
mail containing copy of the </span>decision had been sent to defendant’s
counsel he failed <span style="">to claim the same and his failure was excusable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court denied the
motion to dismiss the </span><span style="">appeal in an order September 18, 1962, at the</span> same<span style=""> time setting the
case for</span> trial on the following October <span style="">12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
October </span>10, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration <span style="">of the order of d</span>enial
<span style="">and set </span>the
motion for hearing <span style="">also on October </span>12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
latter date the Court of <span style="">First Instance not only de</span>nied <span style="">the motion in a formal order but also dism</span><span style="">issed the case for</span><span style=""> failure of plaintiff</span> <span style="">to prosecute, since </span><span style="">she was </span><span style="">not ready to present evidence while</span> <span style="">defendant </span><span style="">was ready </span><span style="">for trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaint</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">ff’s
notice of appeal, dated </span><span style="">October 30, 1962, is "from the </span><span style="">order dismissing the complaint rendered
...(on) </span><span style="">October </span><span style="">12, 1962, the said
order being contrary to </span><span style="">law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In her brief on appeal,
plaintiff devotes </span><span style="">the first </span><span style="">two </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the three </span>errors <span style="">she </span>assigns <span style="">to a discussion </span><span style="">of the </span>order of the Court of First Instance denying
<span style="">her motion t</span>o dismiss
defendant’s appeal from the judgment of the municipal court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with defendant that the correctness
of that order is a moot and academic question, since the present appeal to us
is only from the dismissal of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In any case, whether or not to dismiss defendant’s appeal <span style="">from the </span>municipal <span style="">court </span>on the alleged ground that it
had been perfected out of time depended on whether or not the failure of
defendant's counsel to claim his mail containing a copy of the decision
appealed from was<span style=""> </span>for a
justifiable reason, and is a matter that <span style="">is </span>addressed principally to the discretion
of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not prepared
to <span style="">say </span>that
the said court committed a reversible error in ruling that the delay was excusable
and therefore the appeal was on time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, we are
loath to deny liberal treatment to plaintiff similar to that extended by the
lower court to defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true
that plaintiff did not come prepared for trial on October 12, 1962, nor had she
pre­viously filed a motion for its postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then she </span>had a motion for
reconsideration of the order<span style=""> </span>denying
dismissal of defendant's appeal, and was intending - as in fact she announced <span style="">much </span>intention in open court - to
elevate the matter to a higher court should her motion be turned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently she had a meritorious claim
against defendant, as shown by the fact that the judgment of the municipal
court was in her favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of
her complaint virtually wrote <u>finis</u> to her claim, since such <span style="">dismissal had </span>the
effect of an adjudication on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 3, Rule 17).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We believe that at the
risk of some delay in this </span><span style="">case - for </span><span style="">which both parties appear to be at fault - plaintiff should be given a
fair chance to </span><span style="">vindicate her </span><span style="">asserted
right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">Wherefore</span></b><span style="">, </span><span style="">the order of dismissal </span><span style="">appealed from is
set aside and the case </span>is remanded for trial <span style="">and judgment on the </span>merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
