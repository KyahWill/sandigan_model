<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 22, 1950, the 
plaintiff-appellant, General Insurance and Surety Corporation, filed with the 
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against the herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, spouses <span class="SpellE">Leandro</span> E. 
<span class="SpellE">Castelo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>. The complaint 
alleged that the plaintiff was the owner of a lot located at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, known as No. 34 <span class="SpellE">Bulusan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City" and that the 
defendants were persisting in occupying the said property without paying for the 
corresponding rentals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> despite the plaintiff's 
repeated demands. On </span><st1:date month="10" day="29" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 29, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
defendants' spouses filed a motion to dismiss the above complaint on the grounds 
that the same did not state a cause of action and that the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Municipal</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Court</span></st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">of</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Queznl1</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> had no jurisdiction over the 
case. On </span><st1:date month="11" day="3" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 3, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
however, the said motion was denied on the explanation that "this court 
(Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City) finds that the 
complaint against the defendant has a cause of action."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="11" day="9" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 9, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
defendants filed their "Answer with Counterclaims" to the aforementioned 
complaint. In their answer, the defendants specifically denied the plaintiff's 
claim of ownership over the lot in dispute. They claimed that the "plaintiff 
never acquired ownership over the lot in question, and it (the plaintiff) is 
holding the title if ever one is issued in its name, as trustee and for the 
benefit of the defendants, who are owners thereof." The same answer likewise 
specifically alleged that contrary to the plaintiff's assertion, they, the 
defendants, "are the owners of the lot in question.” On </span><st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1959"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 14, 
1959</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
plaintiff filed its"Rep1y and answer to Counterclaim."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With the issues thus joined, the 
parties entered into trial and in due time, the lower court rendered a decision 
dismissing the complaint "for lack of jurisdiction to determine the same." In 
support of its dismissal on the above ground, the said court ruled that the 
issue presented by the pleadings and at the trial "hinges on a question of 
ownership and for that reason is not cognizable by an inferior 
court."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Thereupon, the plaintiff appealed 
the above decision to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City where it was docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-5126.</span> Once more, the defendants moved for the dismissal of 
.the appealed case on the ground that the said court had no jurisdiction over 
the suit by virtue of the express provision of Section 11 of Rule 40 of the 
Rules of Court. To this motion, the plaintiff-appellant filed an opposition 
which argued for the said Court of First Instance's jurisdiction "either by way 
of appeal or under its original jurisdiction." After two postponements of the 
hearing on the above motion, the same was finally denied by the above court “for 
lack of merit and for failure of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to 
appear.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> then filed a timely motion for reconsideration of 
the above order. Again, the plaintiff-appellant filed an opposition thereto. 
Instead of scheduling a hearing on the said motion for reconsideration, however, 
the Court of First Instance set the case for a pre-trial conference or hearing 
on </span><st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 1, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
Unfortunately, the pre-trial proceedings did not bring the parties to any 
agreeable understanding so that on October 14, 1960, the trial court issued an 
order setting the case for hearing on the merits for October 21, 1960, at 2:80 
in the afternoon. This same order denied the defendants' motion for 
reconsideration "for lack of merit."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="10" day="19" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">October 19, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the 
defendants filed a "Petition to Suspend Trial" on the ground that there was 
another civil case between the same parties involving the question of ownership 
of the lot in dispute. This was opposed by the 
plaintiff-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Without ruling on the above 
petition, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City 
rendered a decision on February 2, 1961 dismissing the complaint on the ground 
that "after carefully going over the records of the instant case and examining 
the, memoranda submitted by both parties, this Court concludes that this case 
should be dismissed because of the insistent objection to the exercise of 
original jurisdiction registered by the defendants from the very beginning." 
From this decision, the plaintiff-appellant perfected an appeal to the Court of 
Appeals which, however, certified the case to this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> recite in their respective briefs what they allege 
to be the "facts" of this case. The appellant adverts to various incidents and 
documents tending to establish its ownership of the lot in question. More 
specifically, the appellant points to an instrument purporting to be a deed of 
sale with a right of repurchase in its favor as well as to the alleged title 
over the disputed realty issued in its name. On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> insist that the above-mentioned deed of sale was 
in fact a mere equitable mortgage land by no means, an instrument which conveyed 
title over the lot in question to the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It must be stated in connection 
with the above dispute as to the "facts" of this case, however, that there has 
not been any finding on them by the court below, the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, since no trial or hearing on the merits 
was ever held therein. The decision under appeal pertains solely to the ruling 
of the said court that it lacks the jurisdiction to try the 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is evident and conclusive upon 
the pleadings filed in this case that the dispute between the parties hereto 
extends beyond the ordinary issues raised in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
cases. For, as earlier pointed out, both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> assert ownership over the lot in question. In the 
complaint filed by the plaintiff-appellant, the latter categorically claims 
ownership of the disputed property. So do the defendants in the answers they 
filed with both the Municipal Court and the Court of First instance of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Quezon</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 
City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. The Municipal Court, therefore, 
was perfectly correct in ruling that the resolution of the dispute "hinges on a 
question of ownership and for that reason is not cognizable by an inferior 
court." <span class="GramE">(Rivera vs. <span class="SpellE">Balili</span>, G. R. 
No.</span> L-15159, </span><st1:date month="9" day="30" year="1963"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">September 30, 
1963</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It only remains, therefore, to 
determine whether the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City could have acquired jurisdiction over the case 
at bar either upon its appellate or original jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Under Section 11 of Rule 40 of 
the Rules of Court, it is provided that: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Sec. 
11.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <i>Lack 
of Jurisdiction</i>.-A case tried by an inferior court without jurisdiction over 
the subject matter shall be dismissed on appeal by the Court of First Instance. 
But instead of dismissing the case, the Court of First Instance in the exercise 
of original jurisdiction, may try the case on the merits if the parties therein 
file their pleadings and go to the trial <i>without any objection to such 
jurisdiction</i>" (Italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the case under consideration, 
the inferior court (Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City) 
which originally tried the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
dismissed the same on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The said court found 
that the litigation involved not merely the question of possession but also the 
issue of ownership over the disputed parcel of land. <span class="GramE">Beyond 
any doubt, though only implicitly, the Court of First Instance concurred with 
the above ruling of the said inferior court when the case was elevated to it on 
appeal.</span> Consequently, under the above-mentioned rule, The Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City could have assumed 
jurisdiction over the said case only in the exercise of its original 
jurisdiction and not on its appellate jurisdiction. Furthermore, it could have 
done so only had the parties herein filed their pleadings and gone to trial 
without any objection to such exercise of the Court of First Instance's original 
jurisdiction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It should be recalled, however, 
that the above requisite to the effect that neither party must object to the 
exercise of the Court of First Instance's original jurisdiction <span class="GramE">never</span> obtained in this instance. The pleadings and records 
bear out the fact that the defendants have been most vigorous and insistent in 
their objection to such exercise of jurisdiction by the Court of First Instance. 
Upon the elevation of the case from the inferior court, the defendants forthwith 
filed a motion to dismiss questioning the jurisdiction of the Court of First 
Instance to try the same. When this-motion was denied, they filed a timely 
motion for reconsideration. These are recorded evidence of the defendants' 
objection to the Court of First Instance's exercise of original jurisdiction. 
Quite rightly, therefore, the said Court of First Instance had no alternative 
but to dismiss the case as it did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the above-cited case of Rivera 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, supra, this Court had already explained 
the operation of Section 11 of Rule 40 when it said: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Pursuant to 
the above rule (See.</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> 11, Rule 40), therefore, the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> could have tried 
the case on the merits only had the parties therein filed their pleadings and 
gone 'to trial without any objection lo such jurisdiction.' That was, however, a 
condition which could not have been met for the reason that a party thereto has 
precisely 'objected to such jurisdiction.' "<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">IN VIEW OF ALL THE 
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the

appellant. This decision is without prejudice to the filing by the appellant of 
whatever claims it may have under the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> 
deed of sale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
