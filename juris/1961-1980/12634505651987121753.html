in Antique province held its first election of officers in the general elec­tions
of November 14, 1967, with the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> and the respondent Benito B. <span class="SpellE">Galido</span>
vying for the mayoralty.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21 the respondent <span class="SpellE">Galido</span>
asked the provin­cial board, acting as municipal board of canvassers pursuant
to section 167(b) of the Revised Election Code, to disregard, as
"obviously manufactured", the election return from pre­cinct 7 on the
ground that the said return shows that 195 voters were registered (of whom 188
voted), when, according to a certificate of the municipal election registrar
only 182 had registered in that precinct as of October 30, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At its session on the following day, November
22, the board, over the objection of one member, voted to reject the return
from precinct <span style="">7 </span>and then
proceeded with the canvass of the <span style="">returns
from the other precincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resulting
tally gave <span class="SpellE">Galido</span> 888 </span>votes as <span style="">against </span><span style="">844 </span><span style="">for <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Galido</span> was proclaimed mayor-elect
of the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sebaste</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 24 <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> wired the
Commission on Elec­tions, protesting the board's action of rejection of the re­turn
from precinct 7 and the subsequent proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Ga­lido</span>,
and challenging the right of two board members, <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Moscoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>, to sit, considering that they were <span class="SpellE">reelectionists</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting on the protest, the COMELEC resolved on <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1967</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"To annul the canvass and proclamation
of the lo­cal officials of the new <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sebaste</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
Antique, which was made by the Provincial Board of Antique;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To constitute the Board of Canvassers by appoint­<span style="">ing </span>the substitutes pursuant to the
provisions of Sec. 167 (a) of the Revised <span style="">Election
</span>Code, which shall canvass anew the results of the election for local
offices of <span class="SpellE">Sebaste</span>, Antique, in accord­ance with the
Instructions to Boards of Canvas­sers contained in the Resolution of the Commis­sion
No. RR-544, particularly No. 5-K thereof, and thereafter to proclaim the
winning candidates for local offices of said municipality."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In turn, <span class="SpellE">Galido</span> asked for a reconsideration on the ground that the
two members of the </span>provincial <span style="">board
who were <span class="SpellE">reelectionists</span> were disqualified from
sitting only when the board </span>was <span style="">acting
as a provincial, but not as a </span>municipal, board <span style="">of canvassers and that the COMELEC </span>resolution <span style="">annulling </span>the canvass and proclamation
of offi­<span style="">cials was </span>issued without
giving <span style="">him an opportunity to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="12"><span style="">December
 4, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> the responde</span>nt
<span style="">Commission reconsidered its previous
order and held "that the canvass and proclamation already made of the
local officials . . . stands".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Failing to secure a reconsideration of this latter resolution, <span class="SpellE">Demafiles</span> filed the present petition for man­damus and <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u><span style=""> </span>to set aside the aforesaid resolution of the COMELEC, to annul
the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Galido</span>, and to secure an order
directing the COMELEC to appoint sub­stitute members of the provincial board and
to order a new canvass of the returns, including that from precinct 7.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three principal issues tendered for resolution in this case
are: (1) whether the respondent board of canvas­sers was within the periphery
of its power in rejecting the return from precinct 7 on the strength of an
election registrar's certificate that a less number of votes than that shown in
the return had registered; (2) whether the provincial board members, who were
candidates for reelec­tion, were disqualified from sitting in the board in its
capacity as a municipal board of <span class="SpellE">canvasssers</span>; and (3)
whether the Commission on Elections can order <span style="">the </span>board of canvassers to count a return from a given precinct.</p>

<p class="BODY">These issues, together with the arguments of the parties, will be
discussed <u>seriatim</u>, but we must first proceed to dispose of the
preliminary question raised by the res­pondent <span class="SpellE">Galido</span>,
namely, that this case is moot because he had taken his oath and assumed office
on November 22, pursuant to Republic Act 4870.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the frame of reference is section 2 of the statute
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The first mayor, vice-mayor and councilors of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sebaste</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
shall be elected <span style="">in </span>the next
general elections for local officials and shall have qualified <span style="">[sic]."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In our view </span>the
last portion of the provision -- "and shall have qualified" -- is
devoid of <span style="">any </span>meaning, is
unmitigated jargon in or out of context, and does not warrant the res­pondent's
reading that the term of office of the first muni­cipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Sebaste</span> begins immediately after their proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite probable that that is what the
legislature meant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But here is a clear
case of a failure to express a meaning, and a <span style="">becoming </span>sense of judicial modesty forbids the courts from
assuming and, consequently, from sup­plying. "If there is no meaning in
it," said the King in <u>Alice</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Wonderland</u>,
"that saves a world of trouble you know, as we needn't try to find
any." Frankfurter, who himself was fond of quoting this passage,
admonishes that "a judge must not rewrite a statute, neither to enlarge
nor to contract it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever temptations
the <span class="SpellE">statemanship</span> of policy-making might wisely
suggest, construction must eschew interpolation and evisceration."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, we have to go by the general rule that the term of office of municipal
officials shall begin on the first day of January following their election,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and so the assumption of office by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Galido</span>
in no way affected the basic issues in this case, which we now reach and
resolve.</p>

<p class="NUM"><u>First</u>, a canvassing board performs a purely ministerial
function - that of compiling and adding the results as they appear in the
returns transmitted to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the
teach­ing in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span> <u>Party</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elections</u>:<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
"the canvassers are to be satisfied of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">genuiness</span></span><span style=""> of </span>the re­turns - namely, that the
papers presented to them are not forged and spurious, that they are returns,
and that they are signed by the proper officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When so satisfied, . . . they may not reject
any returns because of informalities in them or because of illegal and
fraudulent practices in the elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, they cannot pass upon the validity of an election return, much less
exclude it from the canvass on the ground that the votes cast in the precinct
from whence it came are illegal.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the exclusion of the return in this case is sought to be
justified on the ground that it is "obviously manufactured" because,
contrary to the statement therein that there were 195 registered voters, of
whom 188 voted, the certificate of the local election registrar states that
only 182 voters had re­gistered on October 30, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span> <u>v</u>.
<u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Elec­tions</u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></u></span></a>
is cited in support of this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lagumbay</u></span><u> </u>the re­turns were palpably false as
it was indeed statistically im­probable that "all the <u>eight </u>candidates
of one party garnered <u>all the</u> <u>votes,</u> <u>each</u> <span style="">of them r</span><u>eceiving exactly</u> <u>the</u>
<u>same</u> <u>number</u>, whereas all the eight candidates of the other party
got pre­cisely <u>nothing</u>." In other words, the aid of evidence <span class="SpellE">aliunde</span> was not needed, as "the fraud [being] so
palpable from the return itself (<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ipsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>loquitur</u></span><u> </u>-<u>
</u>the thing speaks for itself), there is no reason to accept it and give it
prima facie value."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the return in this case shows nothing on its
face from which the canvassers might conclude that it does not speak the truth.
It is only when it is compared with the certificate of the election registrar
that a discrepancy appears as to the number of registered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The return therefore is by no means
"obviously manufactured" so as to justify its exclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to belittle the respondent's claim that more people
than registered voters were allowed to vote in precinct <span style="">7. </span>Perhaps that is true, although the petitioner claims that
after October 30, 1967 eight more voters were allowed to register (making a
total of 190 voters), and on the day of the election 5 voters erroneously
assigned to precinct <span style="">6 </span>were
allowed to vote in precinct <span style="">7 </span>because
that was where they were really assigned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The point is simply that this question should be threshed out in an
election contest. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lagumbay</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span></u>itself explicitly says -?</p>

<blockquote>"Of course we agree that fraud in the hold­ing of the election
should be handled - and fi­nally settled - by the corresponding courts or
electoral tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the general
rule, where testimonial or documentary evidence is necessary . . . "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the canvass made and proclamation had should be
annulled.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM"><u>Second</u>, the canvass and proclamation should be annulled
because two of the four members of the board of canvassers were disqualified
from sitting in it, they being candidates for reelection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salcedo</u></span>
<u>v</u>. <u>Commission<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on</u> <u>Elections:</u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"An added reason for the nullification of the actuation of the
Provincial Board of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Min­doro</span> is the fact
that its members were disqualified to act it appearing that they were all
candidates for reelection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clear
from Section 28 of the Revised Election Code which provides that any member of
the provincial board who is a candidate for an elective office shall be incompetent
to act in said board in the performance of its duties in <span style="">connection </span>with the election."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Branding </span>the above
statement as <u>obiter</u> <u>dictum</u>, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Galido</span>
argues that re-<span class="SpellE">electionist</span> members of the provincial
board are disqualified under section 28 only when the board acts as a
provincial board of canvassers, to pre<span style="">vent
them from canvassing their own votes, and not when they sit as a municipal
board of canvassers.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
canvass and proclamation made by the provincial board of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, three issues were raised in <span class="SpellE"><u>Salcedo</u></span><u>,</u>
in resolving </span>which this Court <span style="">held
(1) that a pro­vincial board cannot act as a municipal board of canvassers
where a municipal council has been formed; (2) that provincial board members
who are candidates for reelection are disquali­fied to sit in the board; and
(3) that a board of canvassers which excludes from canvass the return from a
precinct acts "in contravention of law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate the language
of section 28 is all-inclusive. Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Any member of a provincial board or of a mu­nicipal council
who is a candidate for office in any election, shall be incompetent to act on
said body in the performance of the duties thereof re­lative to said election .
. . "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
statute draws no distinction between the provincial board acting as a
provincial board of canvassers and the same board acting as a municipal
canvassing body for new municipalities, and so we make none, in line with the
maxim <span class="SpellE"><u>ubi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lex</u></span>
<u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>distinguit</u></span><u>, <span class="SpellE">nec</span></u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>nos</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>distinguere</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">debemos</span>.<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><u>Third</u>, it is now settled doctrine that the COMELEC has the
power to annul an illegal canvass and an illegal proclama­tion <span style="">as when </span>they are based on incomplete returns,
and order a new canvass to be made by counting the returns wrongfully excluded.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
If it has power to direct that certain copies of election returns be used in
preference to other copies of the same returns,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
there is no reason why it cannot direct can­vassing bodies to count all returns
which are otherwise re­gular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it
is its duty to do so, failing which it may be compelled by mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier pointed out, it is the ministerial
function of a board of canvassers to count the results as they appear in the
returns which on their face do not reveal any irregularities or falsities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, the resolutions dated December 4 and 8,
1967 of the Commission on Elections are set aside, and the </span>canvass of
returns made and the subsequent proclamation of the respondent Benito B. <span class="SpellE">Galido</span> are annulled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respond­ent Commission on Elections is hereby directed (1) to ap­point
new members of the board of canvassers in substitution of <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Moscoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>, and (2) immediately thereafter to order the board
of canvassers as reconstituted to convene, canvass all votes including those
appearing in the return from precinct <span style="">7,
</span>and, in accordance with the re­sults of such canvass, proclaim the
winning candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the
