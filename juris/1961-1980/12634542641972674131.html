				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
and Mariano Ramos from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, in its Criminal Case No. 160-G, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which decreed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISED on the foregoing considerations, the Court hereby
finds Lucia <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> and Mariano Ramos GUILTY beyond
reasonable doubt, the first as principal and the second as accomplice, of the
crime of kidnapping for ransom, defined by Article 267 of the Revised Penal
Code and punished by the last paragraph thereof as amended by Republic Acts
Nos. 18 and 1084.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the offense having
been committed prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 1084, the correct
penalty for the accused should be that provided in the last paragraph of
Article 267, as amended by Republic Act No. 18, which is reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There being two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating to offset
the same, the penalty should be imposed in the maximum which is death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But taking into consideration that the
accused <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> is
now in his declining years, 64 years of age, not in the best of health, the
Court is of the sense that justice would be better <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>
if he is only imprisoned for the rest of his natu­ral life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the Court hereby sentences <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> to suffer RECLUSION
PERPETUA and to pay one-tenth of the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Mariano Ramos being an accomplice only, the correct penalty
for his guilt is one degree lower than reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>
and that is reclusion temporal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying
now the in­determinate sentence law, Mariano Ramos is hereby sentenced to a
minimum of TWELVE (12) YEARS of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor to a
maximum of TWENTY (20) YEARS of reclusion temporal, to pay one-tenth of the
costs, with credit to one-half of his preventive imprisonment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts which are not in dispute are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that in the afternoon of 21 April 1954, a
Chinese merchant, Wee King, was kidnapped by several armed men dressed in Army
uniforms, from his house in <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, taken to the mountain fastnesses of <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> Peninsula, he was held there in custody for thirty
days and then ransomed by his wife for P30,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the accused appellant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> was the vice-mayor
of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, while the other
appellant, Mariano Ramos, was the <span class="SpellE"><u>teniente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>concejal</u></span> of barrio <span class="SpellE">Camandizon</span>
(then part of barrio <span class="SpellE">Tagbakan</span> <span class="SpellE">Silangan</span>)
of the same town; that at that time, also, Jose <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
or Lt. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> or Commander <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
known as <span class="SpellE">Hukbalahap</span>, commanded the <span class="SpellE">Tadtad</span> Unit, in charge of kidnapping; and that <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> had previously negotiated for the release of one <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>, kidnapped for ransom by <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
and his gang.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1956" day="11" month="6">11 June 1956</st1:date>,
the two appellants, together with <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> and other
unidentified persons, were charged with Wee King's kidnapping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the lower court sentenced the
accused-appellants as herein before quoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">They appealed to this Court and assigned the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court erred in admitting the alleged confessions,
Exhibits A and B, notwithstanding the fact that they were not freely made by
the accused Mariano Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court erred in giving credence to the
uncorroborated testimony of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span> and Mateo <span class="SpellE">Molines</span>, two self-confessed members of the gang, which
committed the kidnapping.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court erred in ruling that the accused <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> conspired with the
kidnappers of Wee King."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="15" month="4">15 April 1954</st1:date>,
Commander <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> held a conference with Commander <span class="SpellE">Eling</span> <span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span>, head of the <span class="SpellE">Lapu-lapu</span> Unit of the HMB at the latter's headquarters at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bukal</span>, barrio of <span class="SpellE">Ilayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cawayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former inquired from the latter whom they
could trust in the town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and the latter mentioned the name of appellant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> dispatched two of his men, one of whom is
prosecution witness Mariano <span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span>, to fetch <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> at barrio <span class="SpellE">Commandizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The emissaries reached the place and stated
their mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
told them that they could not go right away as he wanted to wait for appellant
Mariano Ramos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Ramos arrived, the
group proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> camp.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a conference with the two <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>
commanders the following morning, <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> was asked
by <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> if he was ready to help, to which he
replied, "<span class="SpellE">Primong</span> <span class="SpellE">Eling</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span>) knows how I help." <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> then asked who was the wealthiest person in town,
to which <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> answered that he knew no other
person than copra merchant Wee King.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> decided to kidnap Wee King and told <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> that he would be given a share of P10,000.00 if the
ransom would be P30,000.00 or a P5,000.00-share if the ransom would be
P20,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
agreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,
pp. 21-28) Ramos took no part in the planning but <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
told him to act as a lookout during the kidnapping.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="21" month="4">21 April 1954</st1:date>,
Wee King was kidnapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> and Ramos acted as look-outs while the kidnapping
was taking place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
"A" &amp; "B").</p>

<p class="BODY">In the band's mountain hide-out, <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
ordered Wee King to write to his wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wee King had been informed by the commander's men that <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> could facilitate his release.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some persons also suggested to Mrs. Wee King that appellant <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> could be of help since he had been a guerilla and
was familiar with the mountains (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp.
76-77).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Wee King accepted the
suggestion and approached <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, with <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
as negotiator, the original demand of the kidnappers for the release of their
victim was gradually reduced from P200,000.00 to P30,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1954" day="22" month="5">22 May 1954</st1:date>,
Mrs. Wee King, accompanied by appellant <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>,
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Orfanel</span> and some other persons, delivered
P30,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> at his hide-out and Wee King
was released.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> then divided the ransom
money, and later sent part thereof to <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing findings of the trial Court are supported by the
testimony of two witnesses, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span> and Mateo <span class="SpellE">Molines</span>, both former <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> (HMB) <span class="SpellE">surrenderers</span>, and by the confessions of the two appellants
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. A and B) given at the Constabulary
headquarters in Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, on June 13 and 20, 1956, respectively, and ratified before Fiscal Pedro <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>, of said city on June 21 of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span> had been the
bodyguard of <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> commander <span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span>,
and had been dispatched to summon <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, to a
conference with <span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>
commander <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> when the kidnapping was agreed
upon, and had brought thither <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> and appellant
Ramos, for whom <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> had waited before conferring
with the commanders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span>
had been present at said conference, and after the ransom was paid, the witness
was sent to deliver <span class="SpellE">Mañosca's</span> share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Molines</span> in his turn
had been a <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> since 1951, but surrendered <span style="">in </span>1953 and thereafter lived for
sometime in <span class="SpellE">Mañosca's</span> house; had accompanied <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> and Ramos to the conference with the rebel
commanders; had witnessed the kidnapping of Wee King, and the subsequent
division of <span class="SpellE">Mañosca's</span> P10,000.00 between <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, Ramos and Mayor <span class="SpellE">Orfanel</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, and had been given P300.00, apparently
as a gratuity for his trouble.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of both witnesses and their credibility are
vigorously assailed by the defense, mainly on the ground that they had, by
their acts, shown to have been <span class="SpellE"><u>particeps</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span>, yet had not been included in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> information; and that they had been utilized as
state witnesses without first being accused and previously discharged by the
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge remarked in
his decision, however, the participation of these witnesses in the kidnapping
had been more passive than active, being merely bystanders and onlookers, who
failed to reveal to the authorities what they knew about the felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While their testimony must be received with
caution, the defense has not shown that they are wholly unreliable and <span class="SpellE">underserving</span> of the credence accorded them by the trial
Court, who saw them testify and was thus in a better position to gauge whether
they were telling the truth on the witness stand.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is urged that not having been previously accused and discharged, these
witnesses had no option but to testify as the prosecution desired; but mere
suspicions are not enough to deprive them of credibility, without adequate
showing that they had been asked and had agreed to prevaricate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the confessions of the accused
appellants themselves confirmed the testimony of both <span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Molines</span> on the essential points.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused appellants contended that their extrajudicial
confessions were obtained through torture and maltreatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there is nothing in record to corroborate
the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were ordered physically
examined twice by physicians, upon representations and petition of the defense
counsel, but no trace of maltreatment was found on their bodies as certified by
the examining doctors, (Exhibits G, X and Y).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the last examination was only made on July 2, (the first was done
on June 28) it is well to note that the wife of appellant Ramos had been
allowed to visit him around the middle of June, and no proof exists that he
complained then about having been maltreated or tortured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, his
confession was only executed on June 20, according to him, as a result of the
violence practiced upon him, only twelve days before his physical examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">To substantiate his claim of maltreatment, <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
asserted that he thought of varying his signature to his confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) from his usual signature (Exhibits 14 to 16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy, however, that when asked to
sign the confession again in the presence of City Attorney <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, for no apparent reason, still used his
allegedly deformed signature, instead of reverting to his former way of
signing, thereby casting doubt on his version.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, if the deformation had been done on the spur of the moment, as
affirmed by this appellant, it is highly improbable that he could have
maintained it without variation when he signed all the pages (4 each) of the
original and copy of the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
signatures, moreover, show no sign of weakness or tremor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did either appellant apprise <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> that they were tortured when they swore to the same
before said official.</p>

<p class="BODY">The army investigators not only denied the torture and
maltreatment claimed by Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, but
revealed to the Court that Ramos had at first manifested to Colonel (now
general) Manuel T. <span class="SpellE">Yan</span> that if the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> family were taken to <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City and thereby assure their safety, he (Ramos) would be willing to
voluntarily tell his participation in the Wee King kidnapping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request was complied with, and after the
family of Ramos was brought, and his wife had visited him, Ramos confessed and
disclosed everything, the conferences he attended with the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span>
commanders before the kidnapping and how the crime was executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statements of Ramos were tape recorded
besides being transcribed in writing (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp.
651-652).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Burgos later replayed this
confession to <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, who after hearing it broke
down and also confessed (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp. 627, 633).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mañosca's</span>
statements were first transcribed and later tape recorded, a fact admitted by
this appellant on cross examination, albeit he asserted that what he spoke into
the recorders he was made to read from his transcribed confession; but the claim
can not be true, since the Court that heard the tape recording noticed some
variation between the tape recorded version and the written confession (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., p. 686), besides its being denied by the inves­tigators.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Voluntariness</span></span><span style=""> of the confessions is likewise deducible </span>from
the contradictions between them and the testimony of prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Molines</span>; and some of
the statements of the confessants were plainly evasive or mitigating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while the prosecution witnesses denied
that <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> commander <span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span>
participated in the actual kidnapping of Wee King, Ramos in his confession
positively identified <span class="SpellE">Magtapat</span> as having been among
the kidnappers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos stated that during
the kidnapping <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> was present holding a rifle;
but in his confession <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> claimed he was
unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while <span class="SpellE">Molines</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ricaro</span> declared that <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
had been given P10,000.00 by the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> commanders, the
said appellant claimed he received only P300.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally a revealing detail is that disclosed by the victim, Wee
King, in the course of his testimony, that while held a prisoner of the
kidnappers in the <span style="">mountains, his </span>guards told him that <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
would be contacted for his release (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., p.
12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is significant, because as
pointed out in the appealed decision, the <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> guards
then had no reason to assume that the victim's wife would seek <span class="SpellE">Mañosca's</span> intervention to obtain her husband's release,
unless this appellant had previously conspired with the kidnappers.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, appellant <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>
claims to have gone in company with <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Patubo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> de Roses to <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mahagakhak</span>, which is about
11 kilometers from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,
p. 546) to extract <span class="SpellE">buntal</span> fiber <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1954" day="10" month="4"><span style="">10 April 1954</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>and
returned to <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span> on the 23rd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the entire venture, they earned P9.00
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Ramos in turn claims to
have been repairing his house in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> when
Wee King was kidnapped, had heard the commotion of the people and, out of fear,
repaired to the house of <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabangon</span> where he was temporarily living.</p>

<p class="BODY">These alibis are far from convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>,
it <span style="">is </span>rather odd for him to
have taken so much trouble for so long and for such small compensation,
considering that he had a coconut plantation of his own, is an overseer of 500
hectares of coconut and <span class="SpellE">buri</span> and a cattle ranch,
aside from being engaged <span style="">in </span>other gainful activities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to Ramos, he was so near Wee King's place that during the
kidnapping it <span style="">was </span>easy for him
to have been there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi
is so weak a defense that this Court had ruled that in order to be believed,
there should be a demonstration of physical impossibility for the accused to
have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission (<span class="SpellE">Peo</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Limpo</span>, et al., L-13058,
28 January 1961).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the trial Court rendered its decision on <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="3">11 March 1957</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> was 64 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should now be 74.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code
prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when the guilty person is more
than seventy years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A review of
the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine whether <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> or death should be imposed would be
therefore, academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For the foregoing reasons</b>, the appealed decision is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in view of appellant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca's</span> prolonged detention, having been detained from
the inception of this case, and of his advanced age, the Court recommends that
he be extended executive clemency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let <span style="">a </span>copy of this decision be forwarded
