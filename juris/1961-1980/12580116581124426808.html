<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the general elections held in 
November 1959 Dr. <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> was elected municipal mayor, Dr. Juan <span class="SpellE">Bretania</span> was elected municipal vice-mayor, Mr. Mariano <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> was elected municipal councilor with the largest 
number of votes, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> was elected municipal councilor with the second 
largest number of votes, and herein respondent Teresa <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> was also elected municipal councilor with the third 
largest number of votes, in <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo, <span class="SpellE">Iloilo</span>. On September 13, 1963 Municipal Mayor <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> filed a 
certificate of candidacy for the office of member of the provincial board of 
Iloilo; vice-mayor Juan <span class="SpellE">Bretania</span> filed a certificate 
of candidacy for the office of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo; Councilor Mariano <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> filed a certificate of candidacy also for the office 
of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo; and Councilor 
<span class="SpellE">Jugo</span> <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> filed a 
certificate of candidacy for the office of municipal vice-mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo. The certificates of candidacy filed by these 
four municipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo were in 
connection with the general elections that would take place on November 11, 
1963. These four incumbent municipal officials of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo, each having filed a certificate of candidacy 
for an office other than the one he was actually holding, were thereby 
considered as having permanently resigned from office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Herein respondent Teresa <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>, being the municipal councilor that obtained the 
next largest number of votes after the two incumbent municipal councilors who 
were considered permanently resigned, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, 
claimed the office of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 of Republic Act 2264. Accordingly she 
took her oath of office as municipal mayor at midnight of September 13, 1963. 
Also on September 13, 1963, then President <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Macapagal</span> designated herein petitioner Juan <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> as Acting Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo, Iloilo, vice Mayor <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> who had filed his 
certificate of candidacy for the office of member of the Provincial Board. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On September 14, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> filed Civil Case No. 6393 in the Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo against <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> for injunction 
with a writ of preliminary injunction, alleging that <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> was threatening to occupy also the office of 
Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo without any right 
whatsoever, and in violation of her right, and prayed, among others, that a writ 
of preliminary injunction be issued enjoining <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> 
from assuming the office of a Municipal Mayor. On the same day, respondent Judge 
Perfecto B. <span class="SpellE">Querubin</span> of the Court of First Instance of 
Iloilo issued ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> the writ of preliminary 
injunction prayed for, which writ was duly served on <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span>. The latter, without having received a copy of the 
petition, filed an urgent motion, dated September 20, 1963, praying for the 
dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction upon the ground that the same 
had been issued irregularly and without sufficient cause and that whatever 
rights might have been acquired by <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> had lapsed 
upon his (<span class="SpellE">Paranpan's</span>) appointment by the President. 
<span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> filed an opposition, and the motion was orally 
argued. On September 24, 1963 respondent Judge Jesus Rodriguez of the Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo denied the motion for the dissolution of the writ. On 
September 27, 1963 <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the order of Judge Rodriguez denying the motion to dissolve 
the writ, which motion was denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> 
L. <span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, also of the Court of First Instance of 
Iloilo, on October 11, 1963. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On October 31, 1963 <span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> filed the instant petition for certiorari with 
preliminary mandatory injunction before this Court, praying that judgment be 
rendered (1) declaring that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Ferfecto</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Querubin</span> had acted with grave abuse of discretion in 
issuing ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> the writ of preliminary injunction, 
(2) declaring that respondent Judge Jesus Rodriguez had acted with grave abuse 
of discretion in denying the motion for the dissolution of the writ, (3) 
declaring that respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> <span class="SpellE">Fernan</span> acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying the 
motion for reconsideration of the order of Judge Jesus Rodriguez denying the 
motion for the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction - all in Civil 
Case No. 6393 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo; and (4) that a writ of 
preliminary mandatory injunction be issued ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> by 
this Court dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction issued in the lower 
court so that the status quo could be maintained pending the decision by this 
Court of the petition for certiorari. This Court gave the petition due course, 
but did not issue the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction prayed 
for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Respondent Teresa B. <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> filed before this Court her answer to the petition 
on December 7, 1963. This case was set for hearing on February 10, 1964, but 
nobody appeared for the parties. However, upon a motion made by telegram, the 
respondents were given a period of 20 days within which to submit a memorandum 
in lieu of oral argument. No memorandum appears in the record of this 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This Court takes judicial notice 
that in the general elections of November 11, 1963, a new set of municipal 
officials had been elected for <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo, Iloilo, 
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> had ceased to occupy the 
office of Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo because the 
person elected Municipal Mayor on November 11, 1963 had assumed office on 
January 1, 1964, and, therefore, no more vacancy in the office of Municipal 
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span> Nuevo can be claimed by petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Paranpan</span> by virtue of his appointment as Municipal 
Mayor by the President of the Philippines. This case has become moot and 
academic. WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari with preliminary mandatory 
injunction in the present case is dismissed, without 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
