Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 11, 1957 appellant CALSONS, INC. applied for a loan of
P2,000,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to pay the balance of the
purchase price of certain parcels of land situated at the corner of <span class="SpellE">Globo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elizondo</span> Streets, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, Manila,
and to finance the construction <span class="GramE">of</span> a two-storey
textile market building on said land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The application was approved by <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
Board of Trustees on <st1:date year="1957" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with said loan appellants executed
on October 31, 1957 a promissory note binding themselves jointly and severally
to pay <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>,
with interest at the rate of 7% per annum compounded monthly, in 120 equal
monthly installments of P23,221.69 each.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under said note "the first installment shall be due and payable
beginning the month following the last release and/or the month following the
expiration of the period for the construction of the textile market building,
whichever is earlier, and the rest on the 7th day of every month thereafter
until the principal of TWO MILLION PESOS (P2<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>)
and the interest shall have been fully paid." To secure pay­ment of the
note "and/or the interest thereon and/or other obligations arising <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>", appellants executed on the same date a
first mortgage in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> on five (5)
parcels of land particularly described in the mortgage contract, "together
with all the buildings and improvements now <span style="">existing </span>thereon or which may hereafter be constructed on the
mortgaged property (<span class="SpellE">ies</span>) of which MORTGAGOR is the
absolute owner, free from all liens and encumbrances." The aforementioned
five (5) parcels of land were among the properties acquired by appellant
CALSONS, INC., from <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Sampedro</span>,
Inc., for and in consideration of the sum of ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
PESOS (P1,100,000.00) under a Deed of Assignment dated October 29, 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conditions of the mortgage contract which are relevant to
this case are the following:</p>

<blockquote>"2. The MORTGAGOR shall not sell, dispose of, mortgage, nor in
any manner encumber the mortgaged property (<span class="SpellE">ies</span>)
without the prior written consent of the MORTGAGEE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. If the MORTGAGOR shall, at any time, fail or refuse to pay
any of the amortizations on the indebtedness, or the interest when due, or
whatever other obligation herein agreed, then all the amortizations and other
obligations of the MORTGAGOR of any nature, shall become due, payable and
defaulted and the MORTGAGEE may immediately foreclose this mortgage judicially
or extrajudicia<span class="SpellE">lly</span> under Act 3135, as amended and/or
under C.A. 186, as amended, and/or Act No. 1508, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"14. <span class="GramE">This</span> mortgage shall furthermore
be subject to the following ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1) That the
applicant shall pay to the system <span style="">P23<span class="GramE">,221.70</span> </span>monthly, including principal and interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) That the first
release of <span style="">P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
</span>on this loan shall be made only after:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
xxx</p>

<blockquote>b. The submission of
evidence showing payment on realty taxes up to and including that of the
current year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c. The submission of
evidence showing the reduction of applicant's account on the lot to at least
P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d. The submission of the
certificates of title in the name of the applicant to the property offered as
collateral for this loan; provided, that if the said certificates of title
could not be secured without paying the balance of the purchase price, said
balance shall be paid first from the first release of this loan;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) That the check covering the obligation
of applicant on the lots offered as collateral shall be drawn in favor of the
vendor of said lots;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4) That subsequent releases on this loan
shall be controlled in such manner that the amount to be released shall depend
on the progress of the work done on the proposed building but in no case shall
the amount to be re­leased and the amounts already released exceed 60% of the
appraised value of the lots and the existing improvements thereon as of every
release;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<blockquote>6) That the proposed building shall be com­pleted
within twelve (12) months from the date the first release on this loan is
made;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first release in the amount of P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
was made on November 7, 1957, while the second (and last) release in the amount
of P30,000.00 was made on May 15, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The checks covering both releases were drawn in favor of the vendor of
the mortgaged properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In accordance with the agreement between the parties, the old
building standing on the mortgaged properties was insured for P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on December 1, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> ad<span style="">vanced the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,628.00</span> for the annual
premium, but appellants failed to reimburse the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Appellee</span></span><span style=""> filed a complaint for the foreclosure of the
mortgage with the Court of First Instance of Manila on August 11, 1958,
alleging </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">number of violations
of the mortgage contract, to wit: (1) that the mortgaged properties had not
been freed by the mortgagor from certain liens and encumbrances other than the
mortgage itself; (2) that without the prior written consent of plaintiff
defendants removed and disposed of </span>the complete band sawmill and filing
machine <span style="">which formed part of the
properties mortgaged; (3) that defendant <span class="SpellE">Calsons</span>,
Inc., failed to submit to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> evidence showing
the reduction of defendant's account </span>on the lot to at least P819,000.00;
<span style="">(4) and that <span class="SpellE">Calsons</span>,
Inc. failed to begin, much less complete, the construction of the super­market
building on the mortgaged properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
August 11, 1959, plaintiff filed supplemental complaint, which was ad­mitted
without opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two additional
grounds for the foreclosure of the mortgage were alleged, namely: (1) that
defendants failed, despite demands <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, to pay
the amortizations due and payable, including accrued interest and surcharges,
on the portion of the loan released to them; and (2) that defendants failed to
complete the construction of the textile market building on the mortgaged
properties within 12 months from November 7, 1957, the date of the </span>first
release of P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judgment was rendered on March 3, 1962 in favor of plaintiff, and
defendants brought this appeal directly to this Court in view of the amount
involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their brief, appellants make the following <span style="">assignment of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The second and fourth
errors assigned are interrelated and will first be taken up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two certificates of title covering the
mortgaged properties do not show any lien or encumbrance thereon other than the
mortgage it­self.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is admitted by
both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
refers, however, to the vendor's lien in favor of the former owners,
representing the unpaid balance of P280<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on the
purchase price of the lots mortgaged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lien, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> points out, is a legal
encumbrance and therefore effective although not recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, appellants contend that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
invoking its right to have the mortgaged pro­perties free from the vendor's
lien on two grounds, namely: (1) that appellant had previous knowledge of said
lien as evidenced by the two releases of P819,000 and P30,000 directly to the
vendor of the mortgaged properties, and (2) that ap­pellant committed itself to
pay to the said vendor the amount of P280,000.00, balance on the purchase
price, within a period of six (6) months from October 28, 1957.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention cannot be
sustained on the first ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
the reasons why appellant <span class="SpellE">Calsons</span>, Inc., applied for
the P2,000,000.00 loan was precisely to use part thereof to pay the balance of
the purchase price of five (5) parcels of land it mortgaged to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to
assure <span class="GramE">itself</span> that no vendor's lien attached to the
said properties <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> caused the following
conditions to be added to the original terms of the mortgage contract:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2) That the first
release of P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on this loan shall be made only
after:</blockquote>

<blockquote>e.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The submission of evidence showing the
reduction of applicant's account on the lot to at least P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The submission of the certificates of title in
the name of the applicant to the property offered as collateral for this loan;
provided, that if the said certificates of title could not be secured without
paying the balance of the purchase price said balance shall be paid first from
the first release of this loan;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) That the check
covering the obligation of applicant on the lots offered as collateral shall be
drawn in favor of the vendor of said lots;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the foregoing conditions the check covering the first
release of P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was drawn in favor of the
vendor of the properties, and the release was made upon submission of the two
transfer certificates of title already in the name of appellant <span class="SpellE">Calsons</span>, Inc., as vendee, without any annotation thereon of
any lien or encumbrance except the mortgage itself in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned
out, however, that appellants had failed to reduce their account on the lot to
P819<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, as stipulated in the mortgage contract,
since there was still a balance of P280,000 on the purchase price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the second release of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the check was also drawn in favor of the vendor
with the understanding that it would be used to pay the real estate taxes due
on said properties and thus remove the corresponding tax lien imposed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The steps taken by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> negate any inference that it agreed to waive its
right to have the properties "free from all liens and encumbrances,"
as provided in the mortgage contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estoppel</span> is invoked by appellants on
the basis of a letter dated <st1:date year="1957" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1957</st1:date>, sent by the Manager of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
Real Estate Department to the vendor of the properties, to the effect that the
balance of the purchase price in the amount of P280<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
would be released within six (6) months from the date of the said letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commitment of said Manager was not
recognized by the Board of Trustees of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
as shown by the fact that it was not incor­porated in the mortgage contract,
which was executed on a later date - <st1:date year="1957" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the schedule
of sub­sequent releases was clearly defined in the mortgage contract, no
mention was made about the said commitment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Paragraph 14 (4) of the mortgage contract states:</p>

<blockquote>"(4)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That</span> subsequent releases on this loan shall be controlled in such
manner that the amount to be released shall depend in the progress of the work
done on the proposed building but in no case shall the amount to be released
and the amounts already released exceed 60%, of the appraised value of the lots
and the existing improvements thereon as of every release;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the third error assigned, appellants do not deny the
fact that they removed and disposed of the machineries installed in the
building which were standing on the mortgaged properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they contend that the said
machineries were not included in the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contention is groundless.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgage was on the lands "together with all the
buildings and improvements now existing or which may hereafter be
constructed" thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the machineries,
as found by the trial court, were permanently attached to the property, and
installed there by the former owner to meet the needs of certain works or
industry therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were therefore
part of the immovable pursuant to Article 415 of the Civil Code, and need not
be the subject of a separate chattel mortgage in order to be deemed duly
encumbered in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the fifth assignment of error, appellants point out that
there is no time specified in the mortgage contract within which the
amortizations on the loan should begin to be paid, and conclude that they
should begin only from the time the proposed building started earning
rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision of Paragraph 14
(13) of the mortgage contract is invoked, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"That rentals from the proposed building equivalent to the
monthly amortization on this loan shall be assigned in favor of and made
payable to the System."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a corollary argument, appellants add that since the present
action was instituted three (3) months before the expiration of the
twelve-month period (from <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="11">November 7,
 1957</st1:date>) within which the construction of the supermarket building
should be completed the premature institution of the suit rendered the
construction of said building impossible, and hence no default in payment was
incurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again this contention of appellants is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The promissory note executed by them clearly
provides when the first installment, as well as subsequent ones, would become
due, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The first installment shall be due and payable beginning the
month following the last release and/or <u>the month following the expiration
of the period for the construction of the textile market building, whichever is
earlier</u>, and the rest on the 7th day of every month thereafter until the
principal of TWO MILLION PESOS (P2<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>) and the
interest shall have been fully paid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As previously mentioned, the mortgage
contract provides that the proposed building should be completed within twelve
(12) months from the date of the first release.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said release having been made on November 7, 1957, the construction
period of 12 months expired on November 7, 1958; hence, the first installment
became due one month thereafter or on December 7, 1958, and the rest on the 7th
day of every month thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants’ failure to pay the amortizations, interest and surcharges
demanded of them by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, therefore, constitutes
a violation of the mortgage contract and is sufficient ground for the
foreclosure of the mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the sixth and seventh
assignments of error are without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against
appellants.</p>
