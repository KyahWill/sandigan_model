				G.R. No. L-12836, April 26, 1961</h4>
				<H3>MANILA TRADING AND SUPPLY CO., PETITIONER, VS. HON. EDUARDO D. ENRIQUEZ, IN HIS CAPACITY AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, AND SOCORRO ZAYCO, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction to compel the respondent 
judge of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental to approve the record 
on appeal filed by the petitioner herein in Special Proceedings Nos. 6682 and 
854 of said court, respectively entitled "Testate Estate of Lorenzo Zayco" and 
"Testate Estate of Flora Rubin", and to enjoin the respondent administratrix 
from disposing of the properties of these estates pending consideration of this 
petition. Upon the filing of the petition we granted the preliminary 
injunction.
<p>In said Special Proceedings Nos. 6682 and 854, the respondent judge issued an 
order approving a plenary project of partition submitted by the respondent 
administratrix and said order is now the subject of appeal in the Court of 
Appeals as CA-G. R. Nos. 20262-R and 20263-R. The plenary project of partition 
approved in said order excludes therefrom the petitioner Manila Trading &amp; 
Supply Company.</p>
<p>On May 27, 1957 after the perfection of said appeal, the respondent 
administratrix sent a notice to the petitioner that she would submit for the 
approval of the trial court her "Partial Project of Partition and Declaration of 
Heirs dated June 24, 1956." This partial project of partition was filed earlier 
than the plenary project and was then still pending before the trial court.</p>
<p>When this partial project of partition was filed, an opposition thereto dated 
July 24, 1956 was presented by the petitioner, alleging that if the partial 
project is approved, there will be no other properties against which the 
petitioning company may resort to, if after accounting it is entitled to more 
than the value of the lots mentioned in the "certificado de Venta definitiva". 
Again when said partial project was resubmitted, the petitioner filed another 
opposition dated May 29, 1957, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"COMES NOW claimant, Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co., through counsel, and 
before this Honorable Court respectfully states:</p>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p>That in an order dated November 23, 1956, this Honorable Court approved the 
Project of Partition presented by the administratrix on February 25, 1956.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>That the said order of this Honorable Court dated November 23, 1956 is now on 
appeal before the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>That the approval of the project of partition dated February 25, 1056 is 
tantamount to a denial of the Partial Project of Partition and Declaration of 
the Heirs dated June 24, 1956.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that in view of the foregoing facts, the 
Partial Project of Partition and Declaration of Heirs dated June 24, 1956 cannot 
and should not now or hereafter be resubmitted for consideration by this 
Honorable Court.</p>
<p>Manila for Bacolod City, May 29, 1957."<br>(Annex 'B', p. 16, 
Records.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 10, 1957, the court overruled the objection of petitioner thereto on 
the ground that the properties partitioned are not encumbered in favor of the 
Manila Trading Company. The order also contained a declaration of heirs. On July 
8, 1957, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"COMES NOW claimant, Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co., through counsel and 
before this Honorable Court respectfully moves for a reconsideration of the 
order of this Honorable Court dated June 10, 1957 and received by the 
undersigned on June 20, 1957.</p>
<p>Without waiving or abandoning the grounds for the opposition set forth in our 
first opposition dated July 24, 1956 filed shortly after receipt by the 
undersigned of the "Motion, for Approval of Partial Project of Partition and 
Declaration of Heirs", the attention of this Honorable Court is respectfully 
called to our opposition dated May 29, 1957 which was filed shortly after the 
undersigned received on May 27, 1957 the notice from the attorney for the 
administratrix to the effect that the "Partial Project of Partition and 
Declaration of Heirs" dated June 24, 1956 would be resubmitted for 
consideration, by this Honorable Court. In the last mentioned opposition dated 
May 29, 1957, it was pointed out that in an order dated November 23, 1956, this 
Honorable Court, approved the Project of Partition presented by the 
administratrix on February 23, 1956 is now on appeal before the Court of Appeals 
docketed as cases CA-G. R. Nos. 20262-R and 20263-R. It was also pointed out 
that the approval of the Project of Partition dated February 25, 1956 which is 
now on appeal had the effect of denying the "Partial Project of Partition and 
Declaration of Heirs" dated June 24, 1956.</p>
<p>It is respectfully submittedN that since the perfection of the appeal from 
the order of this Honorable Court dated November 23, 1956 approving the Project 
of Partition this Honorable Court lost jurisdiction to consider or approve any 
other Project of Partition including the "Partial Project of Partition and 
Declaration of Heirs." (Annex "D", pp. 20-21, Records).</p></blockquote>
<p>The motion for reconsideration above set forth was denied in an order dated 
July 13, 1957. On July 30 r 1957 petitioner filed its record on appeal, appeal 
bond and notice of appeal. Opposition to the approval thereof was filed on 
August 7, 1967 on the ground that it was filed out of time and that it contains 
pleadings foreign to the appeal. On August 10, 1957, the court disapproved the 
record on appeal on two grounds, namely, that the motion for reconsideration 
dated July 8, 1957 (filed the following day) is <em>pro forma</em> and did not 
suspend the running of the period for appeal, and that the record on appeal 
contain matters not related to the order sought to be appealed from. On August 
17, 1957, before the petitioner received the order of denial, it filed a reply 
to the opposition to the approval of the record on appeal, and on August 22, 
1957, it again filed a motion for reconsideration of the order disapproving the 
record on appeal. The motion for reconsideration having been denied on August 
27, 1957, the present petition was filed.</p>
<p>The principal question for resolution is whether or not the motion for 
reconsideration filed by petitioner on July 8, 1957 is <em>pro forma</em> and 
did not suspend the running of the period for appeal.</p>
<p>The reason given by the respondent court for considering the motion for 
reconsideration as <em>pro forma</em> is that it does not allege any new ground 
or matter aside from Â¦those already alleged in petitioner's two oppositions and 
it did not, therefore, suspend the running of the period, for the perfection of 
the appeal. Petitioner contends that the cases cited by the court below to 
support its conclusion do not apply because in said cases the motions alluded to 
were second motions for reconsideration, not first motions such as the one at 
bar. We find petitioner's contention meritorious, i. e., that the rule on 
<em>pro forma</em> motions enunciated therein cannot apply because they refer to 
second motions for new trial or reconsideration. In the case at bar only one 
motion for reconsideration has been presented and Rule 37 Section 4 is 
inapplicable (for it expressly refers to a second motion).</p>
<p>But even if the motion for reconsideration now under consideration were a 
second motion, still it may not be considered as <em>pro forma</em> because ft 
alleges another ground for the setting aside of the decision, namely, that the 
court <em>a quo</em> has lost jurisdiction to consider the partial project of 
partition because the project of partition had already been approved by it and 
was then on appeal to the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The order denying the approval of the record on appeal is hereby set aside 
and the petition is granted; The court below is hereby ordered to forward the 
record on appeal and all pertinent papers as the Rules provide. The preliminary 
injunction is hereby made permanent. With costs against respondents.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
