				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Administrative complaint against the Honorable <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> R. Cuevas, Judge of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch IV, filed by <span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bienveni<span style="">do</span></span></span>
P. <span class="SpellE">Jaban</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly, the burden of the charge against respondent is that in
the course of the proceedings in Special Proceedings <span style="">No. </span>25876, the Testate Estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, the respondent issued certain orders which
frustrated in effect the efforts of complainant to recover from said estate,
before the final <span style="">accounting of the
administration and distribution of the estates the amount of P1,000.00 which by
final judgment in Civil Case No. 5985 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, said complainant had been awarded as attorney's fees
against Ramon A. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> and Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, allegedly two of the heirs of said estate, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the corresponding writ of execution issued in
his favor and the orders of the two judges, the <span class="SpellE">Honorables</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Emig­dio</span>
V. <span class="SpellE">Nietes</span>, who had preceded respondent, approving the
payment of said judgment and even threaten­ing the administrator, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, with punishment
for contempt should he fail to pay the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although, to some members of the Court, the writer of this opinion
included, it was apparent upon a reading of the complaint that at most the
respondent could be guilty only of an error of judgment correctible by appropriate
judicial remedy and may not, therefore, be the subject of an administrative complaint,
the other members were of the opinion, which prevailed, that it is best to find
out what is re­spondent's explanation of his attitude in view, particularly, of
the following allegations in the complaint:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That not only the respondent judge negligently
and inefficiently <span class="SpellE">freezed</span> and hold pending the motion
of your undersigned complainant, dated March 25, 1969, for more than 90 days
and the motion of April 15, 1966 held pending without any action for more than
3 years in violation of Sec. 5 of Rep. Act 296 BUT has ALSO deprived your
undersigned com­plainant herein JUSTICE and denied of his RIGHTS to have the
execution of judgment with meaning, FORCE and EFFECT, or making only our
judgment in courts EMPTY, hollow, and FARCE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the acts of the respondent judge violate
his OATH of OFFICE mentioned in Sec. 23 of the Revised Administrative Code and
Sec. 3 of Rep. Act 296, that he should perform his duties to the best of his
ability, to be judicious, to be impartial, to obey all laws, LEGAL ORDERS and
dec<span style="">rees promulgated by a duly
constituted authorities of the Republic of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the final order of February 19, 1966, the
writ of execution, the judgment of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, the Order of March 16, 1964, which the respondent
judge has the duty to respect and obey for the proper administration of
justice, were legal orders and judgment of a duly constituted authorities of
the Republic of the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That
it is the duty of the respondent judge NOT TO OBSTRUCT, DEGRADE, and IMPEDE the
administration of justice or to degrade the execution of judgment of another
court of record or another court of justice, whose execution of judgment is
enforceable through the whole Philippines (Sec. 3, Rule 135, Rules of Court).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That because of the delay in the
administration of justice and even in the enforcement of the writ of execution,
where your undersigned complainant is appearing necessarily in the probate
court of the Court of First Instance in Manila for several times and
considering the transportation expenses involved from <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
to Manila and Manila to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> plus other incidental
expenses, your complainant little by little has spent more than P1,000.00,
which is over and above his claim on the writ of execution of only P600.00, per
Order of February 19, 1966, which is another mockery of justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the processes of the Court of First
Instance in Manila for your undersigned complainant is very expensive and
costly, and that in spite of the many efforts and expenses made, your
respondent <span style="">judge, for whatever personal
reasons he has, had made it only empty, hollow, and without force and effect.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the undersigned complainant herein
believes that the rise of criminality in our country is may be due to the fact
that our people do not have faith, trust and confidence in some of our courts
in the administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proceedings are delayed, costly, and ending only a hollow judgment or a
mockery of justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the undersigned complainant herein
strongly believes <span class="GramE">that</span> the respondent judge has shown
unworthiness and/or to be incompetent to perform his duties of his office
and/or has shown inefficiency and negligence which would undermine the faith
and confidence of our people in our courts of justice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">and</span> considering
that allegedly, the estate has a gross monthly receipt of P158,000.00, whereas
the amount of complainant's claim was only P1,000.00 which even dwindled later
to P600.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So <span class="GramE">We</span>
required respondent to answer the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In due time, albeit with the aid of two extensions,
the respondent filed a lengthy and detailed explanation, supported with
annexes.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1969</st1:date>, the same date on which respondent
filed his <span class="GramE">answer,</span> the complainant filed also a
"Withdrawal of Complaint" alleging:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the undersigned complainant has already
received satisfaction of his claim on the writ of execution of judgment issued
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against the
Estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
chargeable on the hereditary shares of the heirs of RAMON MATUTE and TRINIDAD
MATUTE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The non-payment of such claim
was the primary and basic cause of complaint and cry of injustice by the undersigned
complainant.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That after a review again of the records and
of the facts of the above entitled case, taking special consideration of the
voluminous records of the proceedings of the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> <span class="SpellE">Olave</span> in the
respondent's court which at present is more than 10 volumes of records of the
proceedings of the estate, the undersigned believes that human imperfections
would make us sometimes sustain honest mistake, which mistakes may be in good
faith believed to be valid and may also be correct in the long run. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thus, making an after thought of the case
against the respondent, the undersigned complainant has the feeling at present
that the respondent may be innocent of the charge of the acts which he might be
acting in good faith to be valid taking into consi­deration the subsequent
developments and the present injunction issued by the Supreme Court in the
Estate of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>
against the respondent judge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That to further proceed with the
investigation of the charge would or may only result to waste of the valuable
time of the respondent judge which he ought to devote to more productive work
in the administration of justice in his court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in the same manner, it would also mean more and further expenses of
the undersigned complainant, who is presently living <span style="">in </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, and to
the government in conducting further the investigation after the undersigned
complainant herein has manifested to have been satisfied and to have shown to
have no interest in further prosecuting the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We could have ended this case upon the
receipt of this withdrawal were it not for the prayer of respondent in his
answer that "the complainant be subjected to disciplinary action for
having misled this Court with his baseless and unsupported allegations, thus
wasting the valuable time of this Honorable Court which could have been devoted
to the disposition of other more important matters <span style="">in </span>order to prevent the clogging of its docket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, likewise, prays for such other
relief as may be just and equitable under the premises." In these
premises, <span class="GramE">We</span> have decided to resolve the merits of the
complaint, dispensing, however, with any further hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>find respondent's position and actuation to be very well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is </span>to be noted that complainant's motion for
an order of payment from the funds of the estate still under administration of
the court presided over by the respondent was not for a claim against the
estate itself but against only two of the heirs allegedly entitled to
participate <span style="">in </span>the ultimate
distribution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither the Rules
of Court nor logic permit the consideration of claims of such nature except in
the form of requests for payments of advances to the heirs of an estate, which
obviously can be done only, first, when the <span class="SpellE">movant's</span>
status as an heir or a person entitled to share in the estate is duly
established or unquestioned and, second, if the condition of the estate would
permit the same without causing prejudice or impairment of the shares of the
other prospective <span class="SpellE">distributees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that complainant's claim was
supported by a final judgment being enforced by a writ of execution gave it no
preference over the claims against the estate itself, which according to the
records of the special proceedings, per answer of respondent and not denied by
complainant, exceed the known assets of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to respondent, complainant's
allegation that the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> Estate has a gross monthly
income of P158,000.00 "is clearly a perversion of truth, having no factual
basis whatsoever the same not being re­flected in any of the accounting reports
submitted by any of the administrators of the said estate for any period of
time, as in fact, for the year 1964 the said estate had but a cash balance of
P1,817.12 as per report filed by the administrator, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span style="">S. </span><span class="SpellE">Matute</span>, on February <span style="">8,
</span>1965, a copy of which <span style="">is </span>hereto attached and marked as Annex 1 of this Answer."
In the same connection, respondent further states:</p>

<blockquote>"11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement of the complainant that the
estate has a monthly gross income of P158,200.00 is not only an exaggeration
but a brazen lie purposely devised in or­<span style="">der
to mislead </span>this <span style="">Honorable Court </span>and
<span class="SpellE">subserve</span> his personal purpose and private
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously stated in the
early portion of this Answer, the last accounting submitted by the
administrator of the aforesaid estate immediately prior to the filing of this
claim <span style="">for </span>payment of P600.00
(Annex 1) speaks for itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
financial condition of the estate is such that its income is not even sufficient
enough to affect a settlement and liquidation of its debts and approved claims
against the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why will the Probate
Court therefore give priority or special attention and/or give due course for
this unpaid claim for attorney's fees which, as previously stated, is a
personal obligation of the heirs to whom said services were rendered?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that there is <span style="">a </span>writ of
execution issued by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
to enforce payment or satisfaction of said amount does not convert the same
into that of a claim against the estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is still, and remains to be, a personal obligation or liability of
the heirs concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No amount of writ
of execution issued to enforce the same can convert it into that of a claim
against the estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But let it be
assumed for the sake of argument that said amount of P600.00 became a liability
of the estate because it is now the subject of a writ of execution, is not the
proper remedy merely to file the same with the Probate Court for payment?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What error does the Court commit by not
compelling the administrator of the estate to pay the same in view of the
non-payment of the too many claims still unsatisfied for lack of enough
cash?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's reliance on the previous orders of Judges <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Nietes</span> is misplaced not only because the record does not
show that before acting as they did, the said judges considered the actual
total amount and the condition of the various claims against the estate, as
revealed in the answer of respondent, but also because even complainant himself
did not seem to have pressed hard enough to have said judges have their orders
in his favor implemented during their incumbencies, which would have ended his
difficulties whether rightly or wrongly, from the point of view of the proper
procedure to be observed in such circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We also find as entirely
unwarranted complainant's allegations that "respondent judge inefficiently
<span class="SpellE">freezed</span> and held pending the motion - dated March 25,
1969, for more than 90 days and the motion of April 16, 1966 held pending
without any action for more than three years", thus giving the impression
that respondent is responsible for the delay in the resolution of said
motions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no reason to doubt the
accuracy of respondent's statement of the causes why complainant's motion
remained unresolv­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">great part of the period of delay complained
of was before respondent's term yet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically, respondent's answer states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

accusation against your respondent for allegedly being biased and over-partial

point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your respondent does not know
said <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Matute</span>,
personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, your
respondent, sitting as Judge of the Probate Court of Manila, had time and again

too numerous to be cited in here borne out by orders issued by your respondent <span style="">as </span>Presiding
Judge of Branch IV of the Court of First Instance of Manila in his attempt to
do justice not only to each and every heir but also to all those who may have
an interest in the estate, which attest to the impartiality of this Court - the
orders of January 13, 1969, January 25, 1969 and April 1, 1969, copies of which
are hereto attached and marked as Annexes <span style="">8,
</span>9 and 10, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless
to state that your respondent, in his capacity as Judge of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, could not even be said to be liberal to the administrator
or administrators of the <span class="SpellE">Matute</span> estate at any period
of time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, your respondent is accused of
inefficiency and incompe­tence and were it not for these charges, since it is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the rules of propriety and '<span class="SpellE">delicadeza</span>', it would seem to be out of place to incorporate
in here, a production re­cord of your respondent as Presiding Judge of Branch
IV of the Court of <span style="">First Instance of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report of the Clerk of Court
of the said Court for the years 1967-1968 </span>and 1968-1969 (Annexes <span style="">11 </span>and 12 of this Answer) had always
listed your respondent as the top <span style="">Judge,
having </span>disposed of the most number of cases for the periods covered and
this has been consistently the pattern of productivity of your respondent
within the short span of time that he has presided said Branch which covers a
period of a little over two years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Of </span>course, it may be argued that disposing
of the most number of cases is no barometer of one's efficiency and competence
as a CFI Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it becomes
imperatively necessary for your respondent to mention in here, with all
humility, that in his almost five years stay <span style="">as </span>CFI Judge dating as far back in
his assignment in <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
and notwithstanding that a substantial number of his decisions has been brought
up on appeal either by <i>certiorari</i> or ordinary appeal, <span style="">he </span>has been reversed only twice, one
of which reversals is still pending appeal from the judgment of the Court of
Appeals to this Honorable Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But let
it be assumed that an error was committed by your respondent in deciding a case
one way or the other, and more specifically in the instant case brought to
light by the herein complainant, your respondent humbly submits that the remedy
is not administrative in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was incumbent upon him as a member of the Bar and officer of the Court to ventilate
this alleged erroneous or wrong order before our appellate courts just so the
validity of the same may be passed upon and said ruling subjected to appellate
review either by the Court of Appeals or by this Honorable Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, it is, that trial judges may have erred
in their orders and decision for even the Court of Appeals has, on various
occasions, been reversed by this Honorable Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But is that<span style=""> </span>enough to subject said judges and justices to administrative actions?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all we know, even members of this highest
tribunal sometimes disagree on legal issues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly advocates of both side of a legal controversy diametrically
opposed <span style="">to one </span>another <span style="">cannot </span>be
both cor­rect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">How
much more of the lowly judge of the Court of First In<span style="">stance </span>as your respondent?"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards respondent's prayer that complainant be dealt with
administratively, it is <span class="GramE">Our</span> opinion that the same may
be considered should appropriate proceedings be filed for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the administrative complaint
in this case is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of
this resolution be furnished the Secretary of Justice.</p>
