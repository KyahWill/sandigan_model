				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In December, 1947, Ruperto K. Kangleon, then Secretary of National Defense, 
applied to the Rural Progress Administration for the purchase of a home lot in 
the La Faja Del Mar Estate as a result of which that office adjudicated to him 
Lot No. 7, Block No. 4, situated at Baclaran, Para√±aque, Rizal, with an area of 
574 sq. m. On August 13, 1950, Ricardo Gonzales Lloret, then manager of the 
Rural Progress Administration, sent Kangleon a letter informing him of the 
adjudication and enclosing therewith a sales memorandum which contains all the 
pertinent data regarding the lot. Kangleon did not reply to said letter nor pay 
the first installment of the purchase price of the lot allotted to him.
<p>Thinking that Kangleon had abandoned his right to purchase the lot and upon 
receiving report that Venancio Presingular and his companions were residents of 
the Baclaran estate and were applicants of the same Lot No. 7, manager Lloret, 
without any previous notice to Kangleon, sold on December 29, 1950 to 
Presingular and companions the lot for P6,864.00 at the rate of P12.00 per 
square meter. At the time the sale was executed Executive Order No. 376, dated 
November 28, 1950, issued by the President of the Philippines, abolishing the 
Rural Progress Administration and transferring all its powers, duties and 
functions to the Bureau of Lands, was already in force, although the officers of 
the Rural Progress Ad ministration continued to hold office until December 31, 
1950.</p>
<p>On March 26, 1951, Venancio Presingular and his companions sold all their 
rights, title and interest in the lot to spouses Manuel S. Galvez and Ester R. 
Galvez for the sum of P20,000.00, but, probably realizing that the manager of 
the Rural Progress Administration had no longer power to sell the lot as 
aforesaid, Venancio Presingular secured another agreement to sell covering the 
same lot at the same rate of F12.00 per square meter from the Director of Lands 
on October 26, 1951, said agreement stating that it cancels and replaces the 
agreement to sell executed on December 29, 1950.</p>
<p>In 1952, Kangleon came to know that the lot allotted to him was sold to 
Venancio Presingular by the manager of the Rural Progress Administration. He 
filed a protest with the Director of Lands which at that time had already taken 
over the powers, duties and functions of the defunct Rural Progress 
Administration, and on November 4, 1953, the Director of Lands rendered his 
decision on the conflict ruling that the sale made by the manager of the defunct 
Rural Progress Administration on December 29, 1950 to Venancio Presingular was 
void because at the time it was executed the Rural Progress Administration was 
already abolished, but that the sale of October 26, 1951 made by the Director of 
Lands to Presingular was valid. The Director of Lands dismissed the protest of 
Kangleon for lack of merit. Kangleon appealed from this decision to the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources who rendered his decision in the 
form of an order on June 1, 1954.</p>
<p>In his decision the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources held that 
Lot. No 7 was really allotted by the Rural Progress Administration to Kangleon 
but that the latter did not pay the first installment of the purchase price of 
the lot; that with the exception of his letter to the general manager of the 
Rural Progress Administration, Kangleon did not show such degree of interest as 
to convince that office that he was determined to purchase the lot; and that 
because perhaps of that lack of interest which amounted to negligence, the 
manager of the Rural Progress Administration executed an agreement to sell in 
favor of Presingular and his companions covering the same lot on December 29, 
1950.</p>
<p>The decision upheld the legality of the sale made by the manager of the Rural 
Progress Administration to Venancio Presingular on December 29, 1950 on the 
ground that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources has no 
administrative supervision over the Rural Progress Administration, aside from 
the fact that the action taken by said manager was that of a <em>de facto</em> 
officer and as such it is valid. The decision concluded by giving Kangleon the 
option to purchase the lot from Manuel Galvez by paying to him the amount of 
P20,000.00 the latter had paid as purchase price within 90 days on condition 
that if Kangleon should not pay said amount within the stated period the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources will execute a deed of sale in 
favor of Manuel Galvez. Kangleon did not exercise the option given to him by 
this official and instead proceeded to contest his decision in court.</p>
<p>In view of Kangleon's failure to pay the amount of P20,000.00, the Secretary 
of Agriculture and Natural Resources executed on June 23, 1955 a deed of sale in 
favor of Manuel Galvez and his wife based upon the deed of sale of March 26, 
1951 executed by Venancio Presingular and his companions in favor of said 
spouses. Galvez recorded this sale in the office of the register of deeds and a 
transfer certificate of title was issued to him and his wife on June 23, 
1955.</p>
<p>On June 15, 1955, Kangleon commenced the present action before the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal seeking to enforce the contract of sale allegedly 
entered into between him and the defunct Rural Progress Administration, as well 
as the annulment of the sale made of the lot to Venancio Presingular and his 
companions and, later, to spouses Galvez, which action, however, was later 
converted into a petition for certiorari for a judicial review of the 
administrative adjudication made by the Rural Progress Administration, the 
Director of Land and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. 
Kangleon asked for the execution in his favor of a deed of sale of the lot after 
he had paid the purchase price of P12.00 per square meter, or a total amount of 
P6,864.00.</p>
<p>The court <em>a quo</em> in its decision rendered on June 22, 1957 declared 
the adjudication made by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in 
favor of the Galvez spouses illegal, holding that plaintiff Kangleon had a 
preferential right to purchase the lot. Upon payment by Kangleon to the Land 
Tenure Administration within 30 days after the decision has become final of the 
purchase price at the rate of P12.00 per sq. m., or the total sum of P6,864.00, 
the Land Tenure Administration should execute a deed of sale covering said lot 
in favor of plaintiff. The court declared null and void the previous deeds of 
sale executed in connection with said lot while it ordered the register of deeds 
to cancel the transfer certificate of title issued in favor of the Galvez 
spouses.</p>
<p>In due time, defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals. Plaintiff Kangleon 
died on February 27, 1958, or during the pendency of the appeal, and so he was 
substituted by his widow. In a split decision of 3 to 2, the Court of Appeals 
decided to affirm <i>in toto</i> the decision of the lower court. The case was 
taken to this Court on a petition for review. </p>
<p>The only errors which in our opinion need to be discussed in this instance as 
decisive of the different issues raised in petitioners' brief may be boiled down 
to two, to wit: (1) whether a perfected contract of sale was generated between 
the Rural Progress Administration, thru its manager Lloret in favor of Kangleon, 
with respect to the lot in question; and (2) assuming that there was a perfected 
contract to sell in favor of Kangleon, whether the Rural Progress 
Administration, thru its manager Lloret, as well as the Director of Lands and 
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, gravely abused their 
discretion in subsequently selling the same to Presingular and his companions, 
and later on, to the Galvez spouses.</p>
<ol><li>The instant action for specific performance was instituted by the late 
Kangleon on the assumption that a perfected contract of sale executed in his 
favor by the Rural Progress Administration, thru its manager Lloret, relative to 
the lot in controversy. The court<em> a quo</em> sustained his contention, and 
the Court of Appeals affirmed it. This is now assigned as error. </li></ol>
<p>The Court of Appeals, in sustaining the contention of Kangleon, declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under the facts and law, the majority is of the opinion that there was a 
perfected contract of sale between the late Kangleon and the Rural Progress 
Administration regarding the lot in dispute. The award of the lot to Kangleon 
was approved by the Board of Directors of the Rural Progress Administration, 
according to Ramon Fernandez, a member of the Board. Acting upon a resolution of 
the Board, Lloret wrote to Kangleon on October 30, 1950 (Exhibit B), enclosing 
therein a Sales Memorandum containing all the pertinent date regarding the 
lot."</p></blockquote>
<p>With respect to Kangleon's alleged acceptance of the price of the lot which 
was allegedly adjudicated to him, i.e., P13.00 per sq. m., the Court of Appeals 
pointed out that he had gone twice "to see Lloret about his willingness to make 
the initial payment, and this circumstance suffices to show Kangleon's 
conformity with the price of P13.00 per square meter." Hence, it affirmed the 
decision of the trial court holding that there was already a meeting of the 
minds between Kangleon and the Rural Progress Administration with respect to the 
subject matter and the price thereof and ordered the respondent officials to 
execute the corresponding deed of sale covering the land in controversy in favor 
of Kangleon, similar to the one executed in favor of Presingular.</p>
<p>In assailing this particular holding of the Court of Appeals, petitioners 
point out that there was no clear agreement between Kangleon and the Rural 
Progress Administration as to price as evidenced by the circumstancethat the 
alleged payments tendered by the former to the latter on account of the purchase 
price of the lot could not be accepted by the Rural Progress Administration as 
the land was still under water and has yet to be filled up and the cost of 
filling it up will have to be added to the price thereof. Hence, they insist, in 
view of this disagreement as to price, the contract of sale could not have been 
perfected between Kangleon and the Rural Progress Administration.</p>
<p>Petitioners' contention is tenable. The fact that the Rural Progress 
Administration allotted the land in question to Kangleon in a sales memorandum 
containing all the pertinent data regarding the lot which was forwarded to him 
did not create a perfected contract of sale in his favor, in the same manner as 
this Court did not consider the so-called "Deed of Sale" involved in a similar 
case as one generating a perfected contract of sale between the parties but a 
mere application to purchase the land. Thus, in Alvarez, et al. vs. Board of 
Liquidators, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> this Court made 
the following observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * <em>The agreement which the Board denominated 'contract of sale,' is 
not really a deed of actual sale, but should be considered as a mere application 
on the part of Tomas Alvarez. After the approval of such application it was 
still necessary to have Alvarez' qualification investigated as well as whether 
or not he has complied with the provisions of the laws regarding the disposition 
of lands by the Board of Liquidators</em>. The 'contract of sale' so-called was 
not an ordinary deed of sale of properties but, as shown by the above-quoted 
stipulations, was merely an application subject to revocation in case the 
applicant is found not to possess the qualifications necessary. The Board found 
that Alvarez is not qualified because he did not actually occupy the land but 
merely served as a dummy of another who was disqualified to get this lot, having 
already purchased one lot from the Board of Liquidators. The argument, 
therefore, that the Board of Liquidators had no power under the circumstances to 
order the cancellation of the sale is without foundation either in law or in 
fact." (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>If in the Alvarez case, <em>supra</em>, the controverted deed of sale which 
embodied all the essential elements of a contract of sale by installment was 
considered by this Court merely as an application to buy the land, and not a 
perfected contract of sale, there is more cogent reason to conclude that the 
sales memorandum sent to Kangleon in the instant case has not ripened into that 
juridical relation. In fact, not even a contract to sell the lot was executed by 
Kangleon and the Rural Progress Administration. Hence, neither party could 
compel the other to go through with the transaction because the same is not 
binding upon them. Indeed, under this premise, the Rural Progress Administration 
could not have compelled Kangleon to purchase the property through an action for 
specific performance simply because the latter had gone twice to the office of 
the former offering to pay the price of the lot, in the same manner that 
Kangleon could not compel the Rural Progress Administration, as he now seeks in 
the instant case, to sell the lot to him simply because a sales memorandum 
containing the pertinent data relative to the lot in dispute was forwarded to 
him. Evidently, the court <em>a quo</em> as well as the Court of Appeals, erred 
in concluding that under the circumstances a perfected contract of sale had 
already existed between Kangleon and the Rural Progress Administration.</p>
<ol start="2"><li>Assuming that there was a perfected contract to sell in favor of Kangleon 
with respect to the lot in dispute, did the Rural Progress Administration, as 
well as the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources, gravely abuse their discretion<br>in subsequently selling the same 
lot to Presingular and his companions, and, later on, to Galvez spouses? 
</li></ol>
<p>It is not disputed that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources 
found in his decision that the lot in controversy was really allotted by the 
Rural Progress Administration to Kangleon but that the latter did not pay the 
first installment of the purchase price of the lot; that Kangleon did not show 
such degree of interest as to convince the Rural Progress Administration that he 
was determined to purchase said lot; and that because of this lack of interest 
which amounted to negligence, the manager of said office, upon receiving 
information that Presingular and his companions were residents of the Baclaran 
estate and applicants of the same lot, executed an agreement to sell the lot in 
their favor on December 29, 1950. These findings of fact are binding upon the 
courts and may not now be disturbed unless it can be shown that the official 
concerned acted arbitrarily or with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Since it appears that Kangleon failed to 
pay the first installment of the purchase price of the land, or failed to show 
such degree of interest as to convince the Rural Progress Administration that he 
was determined to purchase it, as in fact he evinced lack of interest which 
amounted to negligence, respondent officials were justified in selling the lot 
to Presingular and his companions, and, later on, to Galvez spouses, who 
apparently acted in good faith not knowing that over the same there existed a 
controversy between the government and Kangleon. </p>
<p>Moreover, it should be noted that the lot in dispute is part of the La Faja 
Del Mar Estate which was acquired by the government for purposes of homesite in 
the light of the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 539, and considering their 
underlying policy that in the application for home lots preference should be 
given to occupants over other private individuals, the decision to sell the lot 
to Presingular and companions must have been reached considering that they were 
the ones in possession thereof while Kangleon had other properties of his own he 
being then the Secretary of National Defense. On the other hand, Kangleon cannot 
find comfort nor anchor his claim on Republic Act 65, which gives preference to 
veterans of the last world war to purchase public land or government-owned, it 
appearing that the preference given by said Act merely refers to agricultural 
farms or subdivisions and not to lands for homesite purposes as the La Faja Del 
Mar Estate. There are, therefore, sufficient reasons that justify the sale of 
the lot to Presingular and his companions as was done by the Rural Progress 
Administration.</p>
<p>Having reached the conclusion that there was no perfected contract of sale 
between Kangleon and the Rural Progress Administration and that respondent 
officials did not commit an abuse of discretion in selling the lot to 
Presingular and his companions, and, later on, to Galvez spouses, we do not deem 
it necessary to discuss the other issues raised by petitioners in their 
brief.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. The action for specific 
performance, as well as the amended and supplemental complaint filed by 
respondents' predecessor-in-interest, are hereby dismissed. No costs.</p> <em>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, </em>and
