				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) is a government-owned and 
controlled corporation organized under Republic Act 1345. Respondent Federation 
of United NAMARCO Distributors Inc., hereinafter referred to as the Federation, 
is a private corporation, the members of which are bona fide distributors and 
retailers of NAMARCO goods. Said members have been joined in this case as 
individual respondents.
<p>On August 8, 1959, the Board of Directors of the Federation addressed a 
letter to the President of the Philippines requesting his intervention to have 
NAMARCO set aside $2,001,031.00, out of a special allocation of $10,000,000.00 
granted to it by the Central Bank, with which to import commodities to be in 
turn allocated to the members of the Federation for distribution. The 
commodities sought to be imported were itemized in the letter.</p>
<p>The condtions under which they were to be allocated to the Federation were 
likewise specified, as follows: (a) the Federation would pay on cash basis the 
procurement cost, plus 5% mark-up; (b) all handling and storage charges of the 
goods imported should be for the account of the Federation; and (c) the 
Federation should distribute said goods among its members and retailers in 
accordance with NAMARCO rules and regulations governing such distribution.</p>
<p>The President indorsed the letter favorably and expressed his desire that the 
request be approved by NAMARCO. On November 3, 1954, the NAMARCO Board of 
Directors passed resolution No. 524 authorizing the importation. On November 16, 
1959, upon payment by the Federation to NAMARCO of the sum of P200,000.00 as 
partial advance on the procurement cost, a contract between them was executed 
whereby NAMARCO sold to the Federation the commodities to be thus imported. The 
contract contained a list thereof, with the corresponding prices, and embodied 
the three (3) conditions enumerated in Resolution No. 524.</p>
<p>In view of the stipulation concerning the handling and storage of the goods, 
the Federation entered into an agreement with the owner of the "Pasig River 
Bodegas" for the purpose. The agreement was duly approved by NAMARCO. As the 
commodities arrived in Manila they were taken care of by and stored in the said 
"bodegas" with the express consent of NAMARCO, and the corresponding storage 
charges were paid by the Federation.</p>
<p>After the initial advance of P200,000.00 additional payments were made by the 
Federation, aggregating over P2,000,000.00, in consideration of which NAMARCO 
invoiced to the Federation the items that had been paid for. On the strength of 
the invoices the "Pasig River Bodegas" released the commodities covered thereby 
to the Federation.</p>
<p>The same procedure was followed until about the end of January 1960, when 
NAMARCO was taken over by a new Board of Directors and a new General Manager. 
The new management thereafter refused further release of goods imported under 
the contract and resolved to allocate them to distribution outlets other than 
the members of the Federation. In view of this development the Federation and 
its members filed an action for specific performance in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 42684).</p>
<p>In its answer to the complaint NAMARCO alleged, by way of defenses, that the 
contract of sale sought to be enforced had been executed by its former General 
Manager, Benjamin F. Estrella, without authority of the Board of Directors; that 
the contract had not been approved by the Auditor General; that according to 
Resolution No. 530 is adopted on October 19, 1959 by the old NAMARCO Board, the 
commodities specified in Resolution No. 524 should be distributed and allocated 
only to regular outlets of the NAMARCO in accordance with its regulations and 
practices; and that in any event NAMARCO was no longer obligated to comply with 
the contract for the reason that the Federation had violated its terms and 
conditions.</p>
<p>In its complaint the Federation prayed for a writ of preliminary injunction 
to restrain NAMARCO and all other persons acting under it from allocating the 
commodities subject of the contract of sale sued upon to distributors other than 
those who were members of the Federation and from removing such commodities from 
the bodegas or wherever they were stored. The writ prayed for was issued on a 
bond of P20.000.00.</p>
<p>On March 17, 1960 the Federation filed a "Motion and Consignation" alleging 
that it had deposited P80,689.92 with respondent Court, which amount, together 
with a certified check for P28,489.82 previously delivered to NAMARCO, covered 
the estimated landed costs, plus 5% mark- up, of certain commodities which had 
already arrived. It was prayed in said motion that the release of said goods be 
authorized. NAMARCO opposed the motion, but the Court granted it by order dated 
March 26, 1960. On different dates thereafter the Federation made similar 
deposits in Court for the same purpose, the amounts deposited being P443.179.51, 
P261,308.16; P457.343.87; P196,493.87; P208,269.90, and P231,519.42, 
respectively. In several orders issued by respondent Court it directed the 
release to the Federation of the commodities covered by the amounts 
deposited.</p>
<p>Motions for reconsideration filed by NAMARCO having been denied, it filed the 
instant petition for certiorari, alleging that the writ of preliminary 
injunction as well as the different orders for the release of the commodities to 
the Federation constituted a grave abuse of discretion, principally on the 
ground that they prejudged the issues in the case, and on the further ground 
that the consignations made by the Federation were not in accordance with the 
law. Pursuant to the prayer in the petition we issued a writ of preliminary 
injunction to restrain respondents from carrying out the orders complained 
of.</p>
<p>Respondents, in their answer, stated among other things that NAMARCO had 
asked the Court to increase the bond for the maintenance of the injunction it 
had issued to P400.000.00, which was granted and duly complied with. On November 
7, 1960 respondents filed a supplement to the answer, alleging that on the 
previous October 15, respondent Court decided the main case in favor of the 
Federation and declared the writ of preliminary injunction permanent. Copy of 
the decision was attached to the supplemental answer.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the writ prayed for by petitioner must be 
denied.</p>
<p>On January 31, 1961 respondents filed a second supplement to their answer, 
alleging that on the previous January 25 petitioner filed a complaint in the 
Court of First Instance of Manila against the Federation (Civil Case No. 46124) 
precisely to enforce compliance with the contract of sale, the validity of which 
had been denied by NAMARCCO in the previous action as well as in the instant 
petition. </p>
<p>Contrary to petitioner's contention, the contract of sale issued upon below 
was duly authorized and approved. The authorization is contained in Resolution 
No. 524 of the NAMARCO Board of Directors for "the immediate importation for the 
following items in the quantities herein mentioned," which items were the very 
ones listed in the latter-request of the Federation to the President of the 
Philippines. The resolution was passed pursuant to the of favorable indorsement 
of that request by the President and hence contemplated that the goods to be 
imported were A for allocation to the Federation and its members. The contract 
of sale signed for NAMARCO by its General Manager on November 16, 1959 expressly 
states that it was entered into by virtue of Resolution No. 524. Aside from a 
such authorization, the contract was subsequently approved by the Board in its 
Resolution No. 14, passed on January 12, I960, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"RESOLVED that the Board of Directors approve, as it hereby approves, the 
contract entered into by and between the NAMARCO and the Federation of United 
NAMARCO Distributors, Inc., for the sale of $2,001,031.00 worth of NAMARCO 
commodities, executed on November 16, 1959, which contract is the subject of an 
inquiry of the Auditor in his 1st indorsement dated December 21, 1959, the 
approval hereof to be subject to the terms and conditions laid down by the Board 
in Resolution No. 524 adopted on November 3, 1959 and in Resolution No. 530 
adopted on November 19, 1959."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner contends, however, that Resolution No. 530, referred in Resolution 
No. 14, in effect nullified, or at least modified, the terms of the contract, 
because Reso VOL. 119, MARCH 31, 1964 793 National Marketing Corp. vs. Tan, 
etc., et at. lution No. 530 prohibited "forward sale" of NAMARCO goods, that is, 
sales thereof prior to their arrival, and the said contract provides for such 
kind of sales, since it was executed before the goods subject thereof arrived. I 
t is at least seriously to be doubted if NAMARCO could unilaterally annul or 
modify the contract. Concerning Resolution No, 530 respondent court states in 
its decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Counsel for the defendant has maintained that this resolution (No. 14) did 
not approve the contract of sale because in his understanding, the contract of 
sale is inconsistent with the provisions of the Resolution No. 530 to which, 
that contract, in approving it, is made subject. In the words of counsel for the 
defendant, the inconsistency is that while Resolution No. 530 'prohibits' 
forward sales', the contract of sale in question partakes the nature of a 
'forward sales' for it is a sale of merchandise before arrival thereof; under 
paragraph 3 of Resolution No. 530, it is the NAMARCO that will distribute and 
allocate the merchandise in question to regular NAMARCO outlets, while under 
paragraph 4 of the contract of sale, plaintiff FEDERATION is the one authorized 
to distribute the merchandise among its members and retailers.' (See Memorandum 
for defendant, p. 6.) Counsel for the defendant argued that, according to the 
testimony of Rodolfo E. Tecson, supervisor of defendant's Marketing Department, 
who was a witness for the defendant, 'it is a regular practice of defendant 
corporation that goods imported should be allocated and distributed to all 
regular NAMARCO outlets or authorized distributors who are willing to purchase 
and market the same (Ibid., p. 6). The witness said so. But with respect to the 
importation now under consideration, the fact is that it is an exception to such 
a regular practice, in that it was recommended to the defendant's board of 
directors by the President of the Philippines to be distributed, through the 
FEDERATION, among the defendant's distributors and retailers, who are members of 
the FEDERATION, the defendant's board of directors acquiesced in that 
recommendation as its Resolution No. 524 shows, and it was implemented with the 
execution of the contract of sale so as to defeat the effects of the strike on 
the defendant against the distribution of goods. On the other hand, it is not 
shown that other distributors or retailers of the defendant, who are not members 
of the FEDERATION, also are willing to purchase and market said 
commodities."</p>
<p>"The Resolution No. 530 does not require that the commodities subject matter 
of said contract of sale should be distributed to <u>all</u> regular outlets of 
the defendant; it states that "Die goods shall be distributed and allocated only 
to regular NAMARCO outlets x x x, meaning that, considering the fact that the 
Resolution No. 530 is but amendatory to Resolution No. 524, only the 
FEDELATION'S members who are defendant's regular outlets should participate in 
the distribution of said commodities. The requirement is satisfied by the fact 
that all the FEDERATION'S members are defendant's regular outlets as the 
defendant itself has admitted. At any rate, the contract of sale in question 
having been formally approved by defendant's board of directors and the 
defendant thereby is bound, the provisions of said contract should be followed, 
one of which provides 'that the items and/or merchandise sold by NAMARCO to the 
FEDERATION shall be distributed among its members and retailers in accordance 
with NAMARCO'S existing rules and regulations governing the distribution of 
NAMARCO goods. x x x'.</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner also contends that the contract of sale in question was never 
approved by the Auditor-General. In its decision respondent court ruled on the 
contention as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Passing on the defendant's defense that the contract of sale has not been 
approved by the Auditor General under Administrative Order No. 290 (Exh. 12), 
the evidence for the plaintiffs shows that on December 17, 1959, the then 
General Manager Benjamin F. Estrella of the defendant forwarded said contract to 
the auditor for the defendant for examination and review pursuant to that 
Administrative Order (Exh. N for plaintiffs; Exh. 1 for defendant). The auditor 
did not take action thereon until December 21, 1959 when he had referred said 
contract to defendant's former board of directors, requesting that, if the 
Resolution No, 530 had not nullified the same contract, it 'be first approved by 
the Board before it is forwarded to the Auditor General for examination and 
review' (Exh. NN for plaintiffs; Exh. 2 for defendant). As already stated, said 
contract was formally approved by defendant's former board of directors on 
January 12, 1960, and until March 2, 1960 when the plaintiffs instituted this 
action no objection to said contract from the Auditor General was ever 
expressed."</p></blockquote>
<p>The failure of the Auditor-General to take action was explained by him in his 
indorsement to the NAMARCO auditor dated March 30, 1960, concerning the contract 
of sale. It is there stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appearing that the within contract is the subject-matter of Civil Case 
No. 42684 for Specific Performance with Injunction, filed with the Court of 
First Instance of Manila by the Federation of United NAMARCO Distributors, Inc. 
against the NAMARCO on March 1, 1960, the said contract is herewith returned to 
that Office without action, pending the results of the aforementioned 
case."</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Auditor-General did not disapprove the contract, but 
decided to subordinate his action to whatever the court would decide in the case 
already pending.</p>
<p>Concerning the alleged failure of respondent Federation to comply with its 
obligations under the contract of sale, the Court declared in its decision that 
petitioner "did not even attempt to prove any commission or omission by the 
Federation, constitutive of violation of the terms and conditions of the 
contract of sale."</p>
<p>The decision is not before us for review; indeed the record does not show 
that an appeal from it has been taken. For purposes of the resolution of the 
issue now before us, namely, whether or not a grave abuse of discretion, 
correctable by certiorari, has been committed by respondent Court, its reasons 
and findings in the said decision may properly be taken into consideration. On 
the basis thereof, we conclude that there was no such abuse.</p>
<p>It may be added, as a last observation, that NAMARCO, until the end of 
January 1960, voluntarily complied with the contract and accepted benefits 
thereunder, and on October 15, 1960 filed Civil Case No. 46124 against the 
Federation for the collection of the sum of P611,053.38, representing the cost 
of merchandise allegedly delivered but unpaid. These circumstances show that 
petitioner recognized the validity of such contract; and it should not be heard 
to raise its nullity in the instant proceeding for the purpose of setting aside 
certain interlocutory orders of respondent court.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the writ prayed for is denied, and the injunction issued by this 
Court is dissolved, with costs against petitioner.</p>
