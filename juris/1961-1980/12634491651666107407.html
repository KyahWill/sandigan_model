				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by the Solicitor General from the order of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> granting the
petition of petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span>
Josefina del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>, for a change of name.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1959</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Josefina del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>,
a minor, through her mother and natural guardian, Co­razon Adolfo Calderon,
filed <span style="">a </span>petition in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, praying that her name "<span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Josefina del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>"
be changed to "<span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> Jose­fina
Calderon." It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is an
illegitimate child, born on March 17, 1956, out of a bigamous marriage
contracted by Manuel del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> with Corazon Adolfo;
that the surname "Del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>" which the
petitioner carries is <span style="">a </span>stigma
of illegitimacy, by reason of which she has become the sub­ject of unfair
comments; that the surname which the pe­titioner carries would constitute a
handicap in her life in later years, and would give cause for constant irri­tation
in her social relations with other people; that petitioner is living with her
mother who is now married to Engineer Romeo C. Calderon; and that it is the
desire of the petitioner to have her surname changed from "Del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>" to "Calderon" which is the surname of
her foster father, the husband of her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>publication of
the order for the hearing of the petition was duly made.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July </span><span style="">11, </span><span style="">1960, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
representing the Solicitor General, filed an opposition to the petition upon
the ground that the change of sur­name of the petitioner is unwarranted,
considering that said petitioner was born out of a bigamous marriage and as
such she has the status of an acknowledged natural </span>child by legal
fiction and under the law she should bear the <span style="">surname </span>of her father Manuel del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>;
and that the change of the surname of the petitioner would be preju­dicial to
the rights and interest which she has by vir­tue of the judgment in Civil Case
No. 2272 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
annulling the marriage of her mother, Corazon Adolfo, to Manuel del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>, and would also be prejudicial to her right as
conferred upon her by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for
the petitioner filed a reply to the opposition, the provincial fiscal filed a
supplemental opposition, and counsel for the petitioner filed a reply to the supplemental
opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued an order, <span style="">under date of </span><st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="7"><span style="">July 28, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>granting the petition and ordering
the change of the name of the petitioner from "<span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span>
Josefina del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>" to "<span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span>
Josefina Calderon." The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the order of the court further states:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"This order, however, shall not operate to deprive the petitioner
of her status, rights and obligations as recognized by law."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above-mentioned order the provincial fis­cal,
representing the Solicitor General, appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal the
Solicitor </span>General <span style="">contends</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that the lower court erred in finding as
proper and rea­sonable ground for the change of the surname of the peti­tioner
the reason that petitioner's present surname car­ries the stigma of
illegitimacy, and</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that the lower court erred in declaring
"that although the law is spe­cific that petitioner shall principally use
the surname of the father yet it does not follow that petitioner </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">prohibited from using other surnames when justified."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">issue </span>to be
resolved in the present case <span style="">is </span>whether
the lower court's order granting the petition <span style="">is </span>based upon "proper and reasonable cause" as
required by Section 5 of Rule 103 of the new Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court found that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span>
Josefina del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> was born on March 17, 1956, an
ille­gitimate child of Manuel del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> and Corazon
Adolfo as a result of their bigamous marriage which was an­nulled on July 18,
1957, after a judgment of conviction of said Manuel del <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>
on the complaint for bigamy on December 5, 1956; that subsequently, on December
26, 1957, Corazon Adolfo, mother of the petitioner, got mar­ried to Romeo C.
Calderon; that the petitioner is living with her mother and her foster father;
and that Romeo C. Calderon declared in open court his consent to the
petitioner's adopting his surname, especially so because he is the one
supporting her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court says,
"In the opinion of the Court the reasons adduced by the pe­titioner are
valid and will redound to the best interests of said minor who after all is not
at fault to have come to this world as an illegitimate child."</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition to change the name of an infant,
as in this case, should be granted only where to do so is dearly for the best
in­terest of the child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the mother
of the petitioner filed the instant petition she had in mind what she be­lieved
was for the best interest of her child consider­ing that her husband Romeo C.
Calderon <span style="">is </span>the one sup­porting
the child and that he is agreeable to the child's using his surname.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other had considered the gene­rous
attitude of her husband <span style="">as an </span>opportunity
for her to promote the personality, and enhance the dignity, of her daughter,
by eliminating what constitutes a stigma of illegitimacy which her child would
continue to bear if her surname is that of her illegitimate father.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his brief, avers that the evident
purpose of petitioner in seeking a change of her surname is to conceal her status
as an illegitimate child and that any attempt to conceal illegitimacy cannot be
motivated by good faith and an honest purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Soli­citor General further alleges that to authorize the change of
the name of the petitioner would be to sanction a mis­representation because
the petitioner wants to appear as if she is the daughter of Romeo C.
Calderon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot agree with the view
of the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General seems to support the idea that since the petitioner has the misfortune
of being born illegitimate she must bear that stigma of illegitimacy as long as
she lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That idea should not be
countenanced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice dictates that
every person be allowed to avail of any opportunity to improve his social
standing as long as in so doing he does not cause prejudice or injury to the
interests of the State or of other people.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General also contends that the status of the
petitioner is that of a natural child by legal fic­tion and under Article 367
of the Civil Code she shall principally enjoy the surname of the father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the lower court when it said
that "While it is true that the Code provides that a natural child by
legal fic­tion as the petitioner herein shall principally enjoy the surname of
the father, yet, this does not mean that such child is prohibited by law from
taking another surname with the latter's consent and for justifiable
reasons." If under the law a legitimate child may secure a change of his
name through judicial proceedings, upon a showing of a "proper and
reasonable cause", We do not see any reason why a natural child cannot do
the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pur­pose of the law in
allowing a change of name, as contem­plated by the provisions of Rule 103 of
the Rules of Court, is to give a person an opportunity to improve his
personality and to promote his best interests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are satisfied that the facts and circumstances as borne out by the
record amply justify the change of the surname of the petitioner as ordered by
the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have held that the
matter whether to grant or deny a petition for a change of name is left to the
sound discretion of the court, and in the present case we believe that the <span style="">court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> had exercised its
discretion in a judicious way when it granted the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General expresses an apprehension <span style="">that because the petitioner here </span>is <span style="">of tender </span>age, <span style="">who cannot </span>as yet <span style="">understand
and appreciate the value of the change of her name, may be prejudiced in her
rights under the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This apprehension </span>is
<span style="">dispelled by the pronounce­ment of this
Court, speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Makalin­tal</span>, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> But a </span>change of name as authorized <span style="">under Rule 103 does not by itself define, or
affect a change in, one's existing family re­lations, or in the rights and
duties flowing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; nor does it create new
family rights and duties where none before was exist­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not alter one's legal capacity, civil
status, or citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is alter­ed
is only the name, which </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that word or com­bination of words by which a
person is dis­tinguished from others and which he bears as a label or
appellation for the convenience of </span><span style="">the
</span>world <span style="">at </span>large <span style="">in </span>addressing him, or in speaking of <span style="">or </span>dealing <span style="">with him (38 Am. </span><span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. <span style="">596)." (In Re Petition for the Change of
Name of <span class="SpellE">Joselito</span> Yu, Juan S. </span>Barrera v.
