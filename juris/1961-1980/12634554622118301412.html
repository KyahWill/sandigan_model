				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On August 9, 1966 <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> Mercado filed
with this Court an <span style="">administrative
complaint against </span>Chairman Enrique Medina of the Public Service
Commission, charging him with (1) "non­<span style="">feasance or dereliction of duty;" (2) "misfeasance,
misconduct, and conduct unworthy of a public official;" and (3) </span>"abuse
of discretion and partiality."</p>

<p class="BODY">A chronology of the essential antecedent events is ne­cessary for
a clear <span style="">understanding of the factual
setting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1964 bus operators affiliated with the <span style="">Bus </span>Operators Association of the
Philippines (BOAP) filed an ap<span style="">plication
for increase in passenger fares with the Public Service Commission (hereinafter
referred <span class="GramE">to</span> </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the Commis</span>sion).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending
resolution of this application (which was docketed as case 64-2365), the
Commission, upon motion of the applicants, issued on December <span style="">8, </span><span style="">1965 </span><span style="">an order which provisionally hiked the
transportation rate from 1 1/2 to 2 centavos </span>per kilometer and set the
minimum fare at 15 <span style="">cen­tavos </span>for seven kilometers or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to numerous com­plaints from commuters,
the Commission issued an amendatory order on January <span style="">17, </span>1966, reducing the minimum pro­visional fare to 10 centavos
for five kilometers or less, with the proviso "that in the Greater Manila
area, the <span style="">zo­<span style="">nal </span></span>arrangement provided for in the Order of May 12, 1960, <span style="">Case </span>No. <span style="">97768 </span>(Ruben Beltran, applicant) shall
be applied".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter
residents from <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span style="">complained </span>to <span style="">the </span>Commission that the bus operators, citing as their authority
the "zonal arrangement" proviso, divided <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City into zones and collected fares in <span style="">excess </span>of the provisional rate allowed by the
order of January 17, <span style="">1966.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the protesting commuters was the complainant Mercado who
filed on January <span style="">27, 1966 </span>with
the Complaints, Investigation and Enforcement Division a written <span style="">complaint
denouncing </span>the MM and JD <span style="">bus
companies for overcharging </span>passengers commuting from <span class="SpellE">Pagasa</span>
and Project 6 in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to Manila and back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged amount of the <span style="">overcharge was </span><span style="">5 centavos </span>per ride.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>, chief of the division, conducted three preliminary
hearings on the complaint <span style="">(which <span style="">was </span></span>docketed as case <span style="">66-11-OC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the third hearing, or on March </span><span style="">4, </span><span style="">1966, the complainant filed </span>the same
complaint with the respondent commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
</span><st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1966</st1:date> the
respondent commissioner ordered the <span style="">MM

disciplinary action should not be taken against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="3">March
 17, 1966</st1:date> the respondent conducted <span style="">a </span>formal hearing, at which he
dictated an order which formed the basis of <span style="">his written order </span>of the same
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This latter order states, <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alia</span></u></span><span style="">, “that the alleged </span>overcharging committed by <span style="">the </span><span style="">respondent [the MM Bus Lines, Inc.] was due to <span style="">a confusion created </span></span>by th<span style="">e </span>words ‘<span style="">zonal area or </span>zonal <span style="">arrangements’

system established since </span>many <span style="">years ago, in </span>the <span style="">City </span>of Manila and suburbs, should be
abandoned or conti­nued and to m<span style="">ake </span>the <span style="">necessary </span>report and recommendations to the <span class="SpellE">Conmission</span> not <span style="">later than </span>April <span style="">15, </span>1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This </span>case
will be sat for hearing on the <span style="">merits of the </span>case <span style="">soon </span>after the report <span style="">of the Committee is
filed * </span>* *"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Or
April 14, 1966 </span><span style="">Atty. </span><span style="">Jose Beltran, counsel for the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in
case 64-2365, filed with this Court a </span><span style="">petition </span><span style="">for <u>certiorari</u> with preliminary injunction </span>(G.R. L-25798),
praying that the Commission be enjoined from enforcing its orders of December 8,
1965 and January 17, 1966 and that the said orders be adjudged illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="4">April
 27, 1966</st1:date> the Commission, upon separate motions of the parties, <span style="">indefinitely postponed the </span>hearing on
the merits of case <span style="">64-2365 until final
resolution </span><span style="">of the petition pending be­fore this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
May 10, 1966 Atty. <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>,
Chief Legal Officer of the </span>Commission and <span style="">the third person to be ap­</span>pointed chairman of the committee
created by the March <span style="">17th </span><span style="">order above
adverted to, submitted his recommendations to </span>the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter reserved action on <span style="">the said re­commendations,
and suspended the proceedings in case 66-11-OC, pending the decision of this
Court in G.R. L-25798, believing </span><span style="">that
the </span><span style="">eventual
</span><span style="">resolution of </span><span style="">the latter case
would substantially affect the disposition of the complainant's </span><span style="">charg­</span>es <span style="">against </span><span style="">the MM and JD bus companies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1966</st1:date> the complainant in
writing urged the respondent to <span style="">resolve without delay the case he filed against the
erring bus operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, after about </span><span style="">45 </span>days of inaction on the part of the
respon<span style="">dent, the </span><span style="">complainant
instituted the </span><span style="">present
administra­</span><span style="">tive case, which was thereafter referred by this Court to Mr. Justice </span>Ramon
<span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> of the Court of <span style="">Appeals for in­vestigation, report and
recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August </span>24, <span style="">1967 </span><span style="">Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>,
after an exhaustive investigation, </span><span style="">subm</span>itted his report wherein he recommended
that no disciplinary action <span style="">be taken against the respondent but that </span>he "be en­joined to
proceed with <span style="">the
hearing </span>of Case No. 66-11-OC in order to determine whether or not the <span style="">complaint for
overcharging * * </span>* is meritorious."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">have painstakingly
reviewed </span>the record, and we <span style="">find
</span><span style="">ourselves
in agreement with Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> that the
charges against the respondent commissioner are not substantiated by
sufficient, competent and convincing evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Anent the charge of "non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span>
and dereliction of duty," the complainant alleged that <span style="">the respondent del</span>iberately delayed
the resolution of case 66-11-OC and maliciously prolonged the proceedings
therein in order <span style="">that </span><span style="">in </span>the meantime the erring bus
operators could continue ha<span style="">rassing and
cheating the hapless commuters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed </span>that the creation of the committee was a <span style="">mere dilatory tactic </span><span style="">because its purpose – to study the </span>advantages
and disadvantages <span style="">of the </span>"zonal arrangement" and the "total distance <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>" <span style="">systems – was </span>completely <span style="">alien </span>to the
<span style="">basic </span><span style="">issue </span>of <span style="">overcharging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">respondent </span>countered that he had acted with disp<span style="">atc</span><span style="">h as he </span><span style="">had cited the parties to appear without delay; </span>that <span style="">if </span>there
was delay in the resolution of the complaint, this <span style="">was </span><span style="">not of </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">own design but instead
was warranted </span>by a <span style="">supervening </span><span style="">event–the </span><span style="">filing and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a petition for <u><span style="">certiorari</span></u> in this Court wherein
the legality of the orders of December </span><span style="">8, 1965 </span><span style="">and January 17, </span>1966 <span style="">was
chal­lenged, these orders being the very same orders alleged to have been
violated by the bus companies; and that the crea­tion of the committee was
justified because in the resolu­tion of the issue of overcharging, the question
of what sys­tem should be followed by the bus companies – the "total dis­tance
<span class="SpellE">travelled</span> system" or the "zonal
arrangement" – was in­escapably involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with Mr. Justice
<span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> that the respondent "is guilty of
neither non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span> nor dereliction of duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This offense implies </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">willful or fraudulent omission or neglect of official duty, and not
mere failure to do one particular thing (<span class="SpellE">Hagener</span> v,
Pulitzer Pub. </span><st1:place><span style="">Co.</span></st1:place><span style="">, </span><span style="">158 </span><span style="">S.W. </span>54).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Viewed
in this context, the respondent's actuations manifestly do not amount to
dereliction of duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record </span>shows
that shortly after the respondent received the complaint, he issued a
"show-cause" order against the MM Bus Lines, Inc., and thirteen days
after the filing of the complaint he conducted the first formal hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then believ­ing that the complaint could be
resolved fairly only after a thorough appraisal of the "zonal" and
"total distance <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>" systems, the
respondent created a committee for this purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention of the
complainant that delay was deli­berately resorted to by the respondent to favor
the bus ope­rators, is bereft of evidentiary foundation, We believe, however,
that the respondent commissioner committed an error </span>of judgment in not
proceeding with the hearing of case 66-11-OC, despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
in this Court of the petition for <u>certiorari</u> relative to case
64-2365.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the bus operators are found
guilty of exacting fares beyond the rate provisionally authorized by the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> orders, a subsequent declaration by this Court
that the said orders are valid will not mitigate, much less justify, their
violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
nullity of said orders will not exempt the erring bus companies from liability
for <span style="">in </span>the
very least they could be ordered to make the necessary refund.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, as correctly
pointed out by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" *</span> * * in Case No. 66-11-OC, the
complainant was complaining of having been overcharged by the <span style="">MM </span>Bus Lines, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not, however, question­ing the
increase of rates in connection with the order of the Public <span style="">Service </span>Commission, dated Jan­uary 17,
1966 (Exhibits C and 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
case, neither <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the </span>certiorari <span style="">proceedings </span><span style="">before the Supreme </span><span style="">Court, nor the postponement of </span><span style="">further action, upon </span><span style="">petition of the parties, </span><span style="">in Case No. </span><span style="">64-2365, should have deterred the respondent from continuing with the
proceedings in </span><span style="">Case No. </span><span style="">66-11-OC."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. Regarding the charge of "misfeasance, misconduct and
conduct unworthy of a public official," the complain­ant averred that the
respondent, with manifest intent of favoring the bus operators at the expense
of the riding public, made substantial and prejudicial alterations when his
dictated order was reduced to written form.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the hearing on March 17, <span style="">1966 </span><span style="">the respondent </span>allegedly dictated an order
which contained a finding confirming the overcharging; a directive to <span style="">the bus operators
through </span><span style="">their coun</span>sel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, to refund
the collections made in excess of the authorized rates; a directive creating a
committee <span style="">of </span>three headed by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> with
the respective counsel of the complainant and the respondents as members; and a
directive limiting the function of the committee to <span style="">checking the distance </span><span style="">between <span class="SpellE">Pagasa</span> </span><span style="">District, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the written order was handed down, however, </span>it made no
mention of the finding of overcharging or the directive for refund, named
Angeles Rodriguez commit­tee chairman instead of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
as previously an­nounced, and burdened the committee with the additional <span style="">duty </span>of appraising the advantages and
disadvantages of the <span style="">"zonal </span><span style="">arrangement" </span><span style="">and "total distance <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>"
systems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
respondent vehemently </span><span style="">denied that the changes he </span>introduced <span style="">in the written order altered the </span>essence of the <span style="">dictated order, maintaining that the verbal
order was cor­rected </span>not to favor <span style="">the
bus operators but </span>to make the con­<span style="">tents
thereof </span>conform to <span style="">the facts of
the case </span>and <span style="">his real
intentions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He charged the complainant
with misconstruing the dictated order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A portion of the <span style="">verbal </span><span style="">order,
not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the respondent, states that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of this and considering that the over­charging
committed by the respondent was due to a con<span style="">fusion created by the </span><span style="">word 'zonal </span><span style="">arrangement' appear­ing in </span><span style="">the order of this </span>Commission <span style="">dated May 12, 1960 * * *".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">According to the </span><span style="">respondent, </span><span style="">this statement does not confirm </span><span style="">the accusation of
overcharging.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="">he correctly points
out, it would be superfluous to</span><span style=""> create</span><span style=""> a </span><span style="">committee to make a </span><span style="">"sur­</span><span style="">vey </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the areas <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>" if </span><span style="">there </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">already </span>a <span style="">categorical </span><span style="">finding of
overcharging by the bus operators<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
reproduced dictated order also contains the fol­lowing statements:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(Atty. <span class="SpellE">Regala</span> promises that the
difference in collection will be returned)," and</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"The Commission expects the respondent to voluntarily return
the amounts overcharged * * *".</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Again, we agree with the respondent that these two
statements cannot be construed to constitute an order </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">word
"expects" is not equivalent to </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">command or an
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to that statement
regarding Atty. Regale's pro­mise to make a refund, the respondent testified
that </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">or­dered this portion deleted upon the vigorous
manifestation </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Atty. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Regala</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">that he could not bind or commit his client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony was corroborated by Consuelo
D. <span class="SpellE">Paragas</span>, the stenographer who took down the
dictated order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With
respect to the change of committee chairman, the respondent explained that <span class="GramE">he</span> correction after realizing </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> had already appeared on behalf </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the commuters, and
it would be better if he appointed as chairman one who had not had previous
actuations for or against any of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">When the complainant's counsel protested the
appointment of Angeles Rodriguez on the ground that the latter is a <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">compadre</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>of one of the bus operators, the
respondent unhesitatingly named Atty. <span class="SpellE">Almario</span> to sit
as chairman.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
respondent admitted that the dictated order directed the committee merely to
check the kilometer markings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">However, </span><span style="">he maintained that the
additional function of studying the advantages and disadvantages of the
"zonal arrangement" and "distance <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>"
systems is not unjustified because the "zonal arrangement," as a
method for determining the amount of the fare, was pleaded by the bus operators
in their </span><span style="">deafense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
thus agree with Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the whole, * * * the respondent has satisfactorily
explained the alterations and/or modifications, if any, which he had made in
the final draft of the order which he issued dated <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1966</st1:date> (Exhibit <span style="">J).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In this connection,
it may be stated that the evidence does not clearly establish that, in making
such modifications, the respondent has been actuated by bad faith or any
intention to be partial in favor of the bus operators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the respondent has <span style="">an inherent right, while his order or
judgment is still under his control, to correct errors or mistakes, or
injustices, (Section </span><span style="">5[g], </span><span style="">Rule 135, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court)".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">3. </span>The charge of
"abuse of discretion and partiality" does not <span style="">deserve extended discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
</span>alterations made by the respondent of the dispositions he <span style="">announced in his </span>dictated order were
not motivated by caprice, arbitrariness or partiality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the accusation that the respond<span style="">ent favored the bus operators lacks
evidentiary support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span> aptly observes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“ *</span> * * The charge of partiality against
the respondent has not been satisfactorily established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">While
</span>it may be true that suspicion might have been engen­dered in the mind of
the complainant regarding <span style="">alleged </span>partiality
of the respondent in favor of the bus ope­rators, it may be stated, however,
that mere <span style="">suspicion </span><span style="">or conjecture alone cannot be afforded </span>weight
and cre­<span style="">dence."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Indeed,
no combination of speculation, surmise and suspi­cion, howsoever contrived, can
attain the category of <span class="SpellE">evedentiary</span> proof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">ACCORDINGLY</b><span style="">, the complaint is dismissed, and the
respondent is absolved from all the charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the </span>environmental <span style="">circumstances, however, </span><span style="">it would appear highly advisable that the
respondent proceed with the hearing of case 66-11-OC with reasonable and arrive
at a </span><span style="">decision
with deliberate speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
