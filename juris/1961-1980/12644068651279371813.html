It originated 
from a complaint filed in the Municipal Court of Manila by <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> against Jose R. 
Zamora for the recovery of a sum of money.
<p>It appears that, at the instance of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, 
the Municipal Court ordered the attachment of a motor vehicle belonging to 
defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>. The writ of 
attachment was levied on the vehicle on <st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1960">August 11, 1960</st1:date>. Subsequently, the Municipal Court 
rendered judgment for the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and ordered 
defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> to pay the sum of 
P1<span class="GramE">,740</span>, plus interest at the rate of 12 per cent per 
annum, attorney's fees in the amount of P435 and the costs of the suit. From 
this judgment, the defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> 
appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>
<p>While the case was thus pending appeal, the Allied Finance, Inc. sought and 
was allowed to intervene. According to the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, 
the motor vehicle, which was attached by the sheriff, had previously been 
mortgaged to it by defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> 
to secure the payment of a loan of P3<span class="GramE">,060</span> and that at 
the time of the filing of the complaint in intervention on <st1:date month="12" day="19" year="1960">December 19, 1960</st1:date> there remained a balance of 
P2,451.93 in its favor. <span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> therefore prayed 
that defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> be ordered to 
pay P2<span class="GramE">,451.93</span> as principal, P250 as attorney's fees and 
the cost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on <st1:date month="1" day="12" year="1961">January 12, 
1961</st1:date>, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and defendant 
<st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>, who had earlier been 
declared in default, submitted to the court a compromise agreement wherein 
<st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> admitted being indebted to 
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> in the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,740</span> plus 
P760, representing sheriff, guard and attorney's fees, bond premiums and 
expenses of litigation or in the total sum of P2,500. Since the motor vehicle 
had already been sold on order of the Court for P2<span class="GramE">,500</span> 
to prevent depreciation, defendant 
<st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> agreed to have Plaintiff 
<span class="SpellE">Uy's</span> credit paid out of the proceeds of the sale.</p>
<p>The court found defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> 
to be liable to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,500</span>, and to the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in the 
amount of P2,451.93, plus interest at 12 per cent per annum and attorney's fees 
for P200. But since there was not enough money with which to pay both claims, 
the question was: Which of the two credits is preferred?</p>
<p>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> claims preference on the basis of a 
lien arising from the attachment of the motor vehicle on <st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1960">August 11, 1960</st1:date>. On the other hand, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> bases its claim to preference on a Deed of 
Chattel Mortgage covering the same motor vehicle. This deed was executed on 
<st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1960">January 14, 1960</st1:date> and 
acknowledged before a notary Public on <st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1960">June 20, 1960</st1:date>. As the lower court noted, it is not shown 
whether the mortgage was recorded in the Chattel Mortgage Register and noted in 
the records of the Motor Vehicles Office, although both plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> affirm in 
their briefs that the mortgage was registered on August 24, 1960.</p>
<p>In resolving the issue, the lower court held that <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> claim could not be considered a specially 
preferred credit under Article 2241 (4) of the Civil Code because an 
unregistered chattel mortgage is void. However, the court held that the same 
could be considered a credit appearing in a public instrument under Article 2244 
(14) so that it could be considered preferred over plaintiff's attachment lien 
because of priority of its date.</p>
<p>Plaintiff moved for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> but the same 
was denied. Hence this appeal, plaintiff contending thatâ€”<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><l1>1. The <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> chattel mortgage is void for lack of 
registration, citing Article 2140 of the Civil Code<span class="GramE">;</span><br><l2><br>2. Since it was void, it could not affect 
plaintiff's attachment lien;<o:p></o:p></l2></l1></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><br><l3><br>3. The <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> credit could not be considered a credit 
appearing in a public instrument under Article 2244 (14) because the credit was 
not yet due at the time of the levy of attachment;<o:p></o:p></l3></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><br><l4><br>4. Even if it is 
considered a credit in a public instrument, still plaintiff's lien by attachment 
is superior to the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> credit because 
plaintiff's lien is specially preferred.</l4></p>
<p>Considering the fact that the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Allied 
Finance, Inc. registered its mortgage only on <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1960">August 24, 1960</st1:date>, or subsequent to the date of the writ of 
attachment obtained by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> on <st1:date month="8" day="11" year="1960">August 11, 1960</st1:date>, the credit of the 
<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> cannot prevail over that of the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>The lower court upheld <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">intervenor's</span></span> credit on the ground that, being embodied 
in a public instrument of an earlier date (<st1:date month="6" day="20" year="1960">June 20, 1960</st1:date>), it should take precedence over 
plaintiff's Hen by attachment (August 11, 1960), pursuant to Article 2244 of the 
Civil Code. This is untenable for the reason that, as already stated, the credit 
of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> cannot be considered as preferred 
until the same has been recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office. Thus, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Borlough</u></span><u> vs. Fortune Enterprises, Inc.</u>, 53 
O.G. 4070, it was held that a mortgage of motor vehicles, in order to affect 
third persons, should not only be registered in the Chattel Mortgage Registry, 
but the same should also be Recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office (now the Land 
Transportation Commission), as required in Section 5(e) of the then Revised 
Motor Vehicles Law. There is no doubt that with respect to defendant Zamora and 
the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Allied finance, Inc., plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> is a third person. We therefore hold that plaintiff's 
credit should first be paid.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court is reversed, without 
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
