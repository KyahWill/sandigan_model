grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first case, complainants Rodolfo R. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Corina</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
alleged that the judgment of acquittal rendered by respondent in Criminal Case
No. I-143658 in his court, entitled People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> was marked by bias and ignorance
of the law and was unjust and, furthermore, it was rendered by said respondent
well knowing that it was unjust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
claim that respon<span style="">dent's findings of
facts are not supported by the evidence and that his</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">conclusions
of law conflict with established jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They assert that respondent did not carefully analyze the evidence and
that he "completely disregarded the convincing evidence of the prosecution
and what was discussed in said Decision was only the evidence of the
defense." Respondent was required to comment on the foregoing charges,
which he did on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="7" month="1"><span style="">January 7, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
after careful evaluation of said comment together with its annexes in the light
of the allegations of the complaint and the contents of the annexes thereto,
the Court deems it unnecessary to hold any further proceedings, since on the
basis thereof the matter on hand may already be properly disposed of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

guilty of deceit &amp; fraud in executing the aforesaid agreement with the
complainant to the damage and prejudice of the latter, because as subsequently
discovered by the complainant, respondent <span class="SpellE">Corina</span> <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> is not in fact a lessee to any unit of the <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span> Taxi; neither is she the registered owner of the said

the same by virtue of the order and authority of the owner and operator of the
said taxi company;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

respondent, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, of what happened to the

simply stated that he has 'no more business with the matter because he had
already delivered the vehicle' to the complainant;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing affidavit came about as the basis of <span class="GramE">a</span> <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charge filed by <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span>, which
to the former' disappointment, was dismissed by the Office of the City Fiscal
of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span> went after <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>
claiming that his above-quoted affidavit was perjured in the portions detailed
in the above information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case of
perjury, as already <span style="">stated, fell in the
<span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent judge who after due trial
acquitted <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is this acquittal that complainants, the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span>,
charge was knowingly unjust and was the result of bias and ignorance of the law
of respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his decision in
question, respondent rationalized thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Is it true that <span class="SpellE">Corina</span> <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> is not in fact a lessee to the <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span>
Taxi?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer to this is the
certification made by the Public Service Commission that no lease was ever <span style="">recorded over a taxi of that line in favor of
<span class="SpellE">Corina</span> <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, (Exhibits
'2', '2-B', '3' &amp; '3-A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the
statement that neither is she the registered owner of said motor vehicle subject
of a sale also true?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer to this
is the certificate of the Land Transportation Commission dated July 22, 1969 to
the effect that the car in question (referring to the </span><span style="">car </span><span style="">subject of sale mentioned in Exhibits 'A' and '1') is still registered
in the name of Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is it also true that <span class="SpellE">Corina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> and Rodolfo R. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
employed deceit and fraudulent acts in selling a motor vehicle and subleasing a
franchise over which they have no proprietary nor leasehold rights?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being proven that the vehicle sold,
together with the leasehold rights are still in the name </span>of <span style="">Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span> and
that the alleged special power of attorney in favor of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> is not duly registered with the Public Service
Commission, hence, no legal power </span><span style="">of
attorney had ever been executed and, </span><span style="">therefore, </span><span style="">no legal
leasehold right have been assigned (Exhibits '3' and '3-A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this special power of attorney
executed by Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span> on October 19, 1965 in
favor of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> is only to manage and operate
the five (5) units of <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span> Taxi (Exhibits '7' and
'7-A'), and does not include the power to lease or sell.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Under Article 183 of
the Revised Penal Code, false testimony in other cases and perjury in so­lemn
affirmation states that perjury is committed even by affidavit if the
accused:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) states a falsehood (b) on a
material matter (c) required by law (d) under oath (e) before a competent
officer.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Is there a falsehood in the affidavit in question marked
Exhibit 'N'?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is none because
the claim is supported by legal documents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is therefore clear that the five requisites are <span style="">not complied with and, therefore, there can
be no perjury." (Page 87, Record.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the thrust of the charge of complainants is
that while it is true that the official documents relied upon by respondent
would not show on their faces the ownership of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
of the Ford <span class="SpellE">Cortina</span> car sold to <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>
nor the lease in her favor of the certificate of public convenience to operate
the said car as a taxi, enough authentic documents and testimonies were
presented at the trial before respondent which should have persuaded him to
find that, as the taxi in dispute was being operated under a "<span class="SpellE">kabit</span>" arrangement with <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span>
Taxi or Mrs. Lourdes V. <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>, its owner, in truth
and in fact, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> was the owner of said taxi
and had the authority to operate the same, notwith­standing the absence of any
showing to such effects in the cor<span style="">responding
official documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, it may be stated that the Court takes judicial
notice of the fact that under the commonly known "<span class="SpellE">kabit</span>
system", it is not possible for the true owner of a car which is operated
as a taxi under a certificate of public convenience issued to another person,
for a stipulated remuneration, to maintain the registration of the car in his
name -- it must be registered in the name of the holder of the certificate --,
and, moreover, the common practice <span style="">is
that the lease of the right to operate is not recorded in the Public Service
Commission (now Board of Transportation), for the simple reason that, strictly
speaking, the ''<span class="SpellE">kabit</span>'' arrangement is </span><span style="">illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Bearing this observation in mind, it is indeed possible for a
person to actually own a car and operate it as a taxi without the public
records attesting to such ownership and corresponding authority to
operate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties to a "<span class="SpellE">kabit</span>" arrangement have to protect their respective
interests thru other counter-documents between themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And from what appears in the various
documents and papers attached to the complaint herein, the comment of
respondent and the reply thereto of complainants, this is the important
consideration that respondent is claimed to have overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his decision, respondent allowed himself
to be guided strictly by the public records.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, We are satisfied, having in view, particularly, Annex
2 of complainants' reply, the "Formal Offer of Evidence" and also
Annex 23, the "Memorandum of the Prosecution", that complainants did
present enough evidence at the trial of the perjury case in question from which
a finding of the "<span class="SpellE">kabit</span>" character of the
taxi in question could have been made and, consequently, respondent could have
discerned what were the true facts behind the public records in which the
ownership of the car in question and the authority to operate it as a taxi on
the part of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> did not appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this consideration, it does not
necessarily follow, however, that respondent may be faulted as having knowingly
rendered an unjust decision, <span class="GramE">much</span> less that he was
actuated by actual bias or ignorance of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following portions of respondent's
comment reveal, to <span class="GramE">Our</span> mind, the considerations that
respondent took into account in acting the way he did:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span>
claim that such were <span style="">the facts surrounding
this taxi because the same was operated under the '<span class="SpellE">kabit</span>'
system where an owner of a motor vehicle who wants to operate a taxi but has no
line registers the motor vehicle in the name of the franchise holder to go
around legal requirements and prohibitions concerning the operation of public
utility vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time this was
made, there was already a mis­representation of fact which is that the
franchise holder is the owner of the vehicle when in fact, he is not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The party deceived by this misrepresentation
or who pretends to be deceived is the government, the Public Service Commission
and the Land Trans­portation Commission in particular and the public in
general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this initial
misrepresentation that spawned all these suits involving the parties and which
eventually caught this court in the crossfire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span> and Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>
are the original parties to this misrepresentation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> is not privy
to this because his relationship is with the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span>
and not with Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>, the owner and operator of
the <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span> Taxi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While government records show that the motor vehicle and leasehold
rights to the franchise show that they pertain to Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span> allege, the real fact is that they are
the beneficial owners of the vehicle and leaseholders of a unit of the
franchise thereto and this fact is known to <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the meat of the matter
which is addressed to the discretion of the court as borne out by the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the court the
prosecution has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time the
accused made the alleged <span class="SpellE">perjurious</span> statements, he
was aware of their untruth and that <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> knows this
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he made inquiries
from the Public Service Commission and the Land Transportation Commission
regarding the registra­tion of the lease in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span>
shows that during those times that he made these state­ments, he had doubts
anent this matter, which doubts were confirmed when he discovered that the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span> are not in fact recorded lessees of any unit of
the <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span> Taxi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These doubts were further confirmed when the registered lessee Lourdes
V. <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span> withdrew <span class="SpellE">Oliva's</span>
taxi from operation under the franchise of the <span class="SpellE">Rivar</span>
Taxi, because if this unit of the franchise was really leased to <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>, then <span class="SpellE">Ridad</span> would not
have the authority to withdraw said </span><span style="">taxi </span><span style="">from Operation
under her franchise." (Pages 81-82, Record.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of this explanation of respondent, and considering
that a judge is not to be assumed to be entirely immune to error, it is <span class="GramE">Our</span> considered opinion that what is involved here is more an
error of judgment than a case of actual partiality or deliberate malice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if it were conceded that the weight of
the evidence presented by the prosecution were as complainants maintain it is,
respondent claims, <span style="">he was not convinced
beyond reasonable doubt that <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span> knew of the
falsity of his alleged perjured statements, and We do not Ourselves</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">find
in the record indubitable proof that he did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It results, therefore, that the complaint herein has to be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, <span class="GramE">We</span> note that there have been so many charges and
countercharges between the <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Paulinos</span> that, perhaps, it would be best for them to leave
things as they are insofar as the present one is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent Administrative Matter No. 851-CJ, all that need be said is
that the charge therein should have been taken up by the court together with
the complaint <span style="">in </span>Administrative
Case No. 1222, by the same complainant against the same respondent, since they
both involve exactly the same facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the only difference between the two cases is that Adm. Case No.
1222 was a disbarment proceeding against respondent as a lawyer, whereas now he
is being charged as a judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, in Adm. Case No. 1222, <span class="GramE">We</span> rendered
on February 27, 1976 a resolution exonerating respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see nothing new in the present charge
which would justify a different conclusion, even from the point of view of an
administrative proceeding against a judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We, therefore, adopt the findings and rulings <span class="GramE">We</span>
made in Our former decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the two respective complaints in these two
cases are hereby dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
