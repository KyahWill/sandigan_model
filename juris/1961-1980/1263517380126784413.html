No. 1775 finding appellant <span class="SpellE">Macabato</span> Ali guilty,
beyond reason­able doubt, of murder, and sentencing him to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, with the accessory penalties provided for by law,
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Cabib</span> <span class="SpellE">Di­patuan</span> in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>, <span style="">without </span>subsidiary im­<span style="">prisonment </span>in case of insolvency, and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not disputed that
in the morning of </span><st1:date year="1955" day="23" month="2"><span style="">February 23, 1955</span></st1:date><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Cabib</span> <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span> was killed in <span class="SpellE">Baraas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gave rise to the filing </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">three separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for murder in the
Court of First Instance of said province:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one against herein appellant (Criminal Case No. 1775), another against
Faisal <span class="SpellE">Bo­gabong</span> (Criminal Case No. 1580) and the
third against </span>Omar <span class="SpellE">Alo</span> (Criminal Case No.
1812).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">After </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">joint trial upon </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">plea </span>of not guilty entered by the de­fendants,
Ali and <span class="SpellE">Bogabong</span> were found guilty of mur­der and
sentenced accordingly, while <span class="SpellE">Alo</span> was acquit­ted on
the ground of reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ali <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Bo­gabong</span>
appealed, </span>but the latter, with our approval, withdrew his appeal on <st1:date year="1956" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1956</st1:date> (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18520).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed judgment is based upon the <span style="">testi­mony of <span class="SpellE">Dipumbai</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>
</span>and <span class="SpellE">Kilala</span> <span class="SpellE">Panangila</span>-an
– eye witnesses to the commission of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, appellants main contention
as expounded in his brief is that the trial court erred in giving credit to the
testimony of said witnesses instead of accepting as true that given by the
witnesses for the defense, thus reducing the issue herein to <span style="">a mere </span>question
of credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dipumbai</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>,
single and twenty-five years of age at the time of the trial, testified that in
the morning of February 23, 1955, her now deceased brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Cabib</span> <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span>, left their house
at <span class="SpellE">Baraas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mala­bang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, to take <span style="">a </span>bath in a nearby river, followed by the
other prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Kilala</span> <span class="SpellE">Panangila</span>-an,
a teenager student at the time, and one known as <span class="SpellE">Salim</span>;
that sometime after they had left the house she also followed them to the
river; that upon reaching that place she heard the report <span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">gun and when she looked towards the direction
from </span>which the sound came, she <span style="">saw </span>Ali, <span class="SpellE">Bogabong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Alo</span> on the other side of the river aim­ing and
firing at <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span>; that after the first volley of
shots, <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span> ran away for cover towards the embank­ment
of the river leading towards her house, but successive shots fired by appellant
and his companions hit him and killed him almost instantaneously; that
immediately there­after she informed their relatives of the incident and then
went to make report thereof to the P.C. station where she was able to contact
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span>, and that the <span style="">latter redu</span>ced her declaration into writing three days later
(Exhibit I); that the probable motive that impelled appellant and his companions
to commit the crime was this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>both Ali
end <span class="SpellE">Bogabong</span> were frustrated suitors of her younger <span style="">sister w</span>ho chose to marry the deceased
a short time before he was killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the other <span style="">eye </span>witness, <span class="SpellE">Kilala</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panangila</span>-an, who was practically right behind <span class="SpellE">Cabib</span> <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span> when the latter
was on his way to the nearby river to take <span style="">a </span>bath, is substantially to the same
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that while <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span> was taking a bath in the <span style="">river and while she and <span class="SpellE">Salim</span> were seated on
the nearby embankment, they suddenly heard shots fired from the opposite bank;
that when she looked towards that direction, she saw Ali and <span class="SpellE">Bogabong</span> firing at the deceased <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span>,
and as the latter attempted to run away, he was hit and fell right in front of
her; that the distance between the deceased <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span>,
while he was taking a bath in the river, and appellant and his companions, was
hardly eight or nine meters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">P.C. Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> also took the
witness stand and testified that in the morning of February 23, 1955 pro­secution
witness <span class="SpellE">Dipumbai</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>
reported the killing of <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span> to the headquarters
and, as a result, by orders of his Commanding Officer, he immediately pro­ceeded
to the place of the incident and to the house of the deceased where he saw his
dead body with several gunshot wounds, one at the back passing through the left
nipple, another at the thigh and still another in the forearm; that he then
questioned <span class="SpellE">Dipumbai</span> <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Kilala</span> <span class="SpellE">Panangila</span>-an,
both of whom pointed to appellant and <span class="SpellE">Bogabong</span> as the
ones who had killed <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span>, having thereafter
reduced their respective testimony into writing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence discloses that appellant and his com­panions were
well known to both <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Panangila</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, appellant and <span class="SpellE">Bogabong</span> had been un­successful suitors of <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>' younger sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that, to discredit <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>'
testimony, appellant testified that she had a grudge against him because he had
reported to their elders certain immoral relations between her and the third
accused, Omar <span class="SpellE">Alo</span>, for which, after due
investigation, <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span> was fined P500.00 by <span class="SpellE">Macaorao</span> <span class="SpellE">Balindong</span>, Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Malabang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court, however, found this to be without merit because said Mayor testified
that it was not true that he had imposed such a fine upon <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellant admitted that he <span style="">is </span>a first degree cousin of <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there is no credible evidence showing
prejudice on <span class="SpellE">Bantuas</span>' part, we do not believe that
she would have imputed to appellant the commission of such a grave offense as
that of murder if it was not true that he was really guilty thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent his defense of alibi, appellant claimed that in the morning
in question he <span style="">was </span>in the house
of his father at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Capialo</span>,
five kilometers away, more or less, from <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baraas</span>, the scene of the incident; that between six and
seven o'clock that morning, he was giving lessons on the Koran to a housemate
named <span class="SpellE">Macalangon</span> and it was only about one o'clock
that day that people passing by their house informed him that <span class="SpellE">Cabib</span> had been killed, for which reason, after he had taken
his lunch, he went to <span class="SpellE">Baraas</span> to find out the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">His testimony was corroborated by that of <span class="SpellE">Macalangon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled, however, that alibi is a defense very easily
concocted, and for this reason, to be sustained, it must be supported with
strong and unassailable <span style="">evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Appellant's evidence in this case is
far from being of this nature and can not overcome nor sufficiently weaken that
of the prosecution witnesses mentioned heretofore clearly and positively pointing
to him and to his companions <span style="">as </span>the ones who had killed <span class="SpellE">Dipatuan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding that the appealed judgment <span style="">is in </span>accordance
with law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, with his proportionate
share of the costs taxed against appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the indemnity awarded in the appealed judgment is hereby
increased to P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>
