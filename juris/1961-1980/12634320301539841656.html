<p class="BODY">The private petitioner, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes,
filed in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City a complaint dated June 3, 1976 against her husband, Manuel J. C. Reyes,
for legal separation on the ground that the defendant had attempted to kill the
plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent allegations of
the complaint are:</p>

<blockquote>"6.8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1976</st1:date>, de­fendant went to V.
<span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span> and at­tacked plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pummeled her with fist blows that floored
her, then held her head and, with intent to kill, bumped it several times
against the cement floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she ran upstairs
to her father for protection, he pushed her at the stairway of 13 flights and
she fell sliding to the ground floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Determined to finish her off, he again gave her a strong swing at her
abdomen which floored her half unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were it not for plaintiff's father, he would have succeeded killing her;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1976</st1:date>, al­though on May 11
previous she ceased holding office with de­fendant at <span class="SpellE">Bel</span>-Air
Apartments elsewhere adverted to, she went thereto to get her overnight
bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing her, defendant yelled
at her to get out of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she did not mind him, he suddenly doused her with a glass of grape juice,
kicked her several times that landed at her back and nape, and was going to hit
her with a steel tray as her driver, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Mancera</span>,
came due to her screams for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
fear of further injury and for her life, she rushed to Precinct 5 at <st1:address><st1:street>United
  Nation Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>
Metropoli­tan Police, for assistance and protection;"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff asked for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> for her and her three children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant, petitioner herein, opposed the
application for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> on the ground that his wife had committed
adultery with her physician.</p>

<p class="BODY">The application for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> was set for hearing and submitted for
resolution on the basis of the pleadings and the documents attached thereto by
the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge issued an order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1977</st1:date> granting plaintiff's prayer for
alimony <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
in the amount of P5,000.00 a month commencing from June 1976.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration reiterating
that his wife is not entitled to support during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the case, and, alleging that even if she is entitled, the amount awarded was
ex­cessive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Judge reduced
the amount from P5,000.00 to P4,000.00 a month in an order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1977</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Manuel J. C. Reyes filed a petition for certiorari in the Court
of Appeals dated July 25, 1977 asking that the order granting support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> to
private res­pondent, Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, be annulled
on the ground that the respondent Judge, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Ines-Luciano</span>, had com­mitted a grave abuse of discretion or
that said order be modified inasmuch as the amount awarded as support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> is
excessive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition be­cause:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the plight of the wife during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case for legal separation and that the
husband appears to be financially capable of giving the support, We believe
that the peti­tioner has not presented a clear case of grave abuse of
discretion on the part of the respondent in issuing the questioned orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no compelling reason to give it due
course."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals committed the
following error:</p>

<blockquote>"THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN A MANNER
AMOUNTING TO AN ERROR OF LAW AND A DEPARTURE FROM THE ACCEPTED NORMS LAID DOWN
BY THIS HON. COURT IN THE CASES WE SHALL LATER ON DISCUSS, IN REFUSING TO GIVE

<p class="BODY">It is true that the adultery of the wife is a defense in an
action for support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the alleged
adultery of the wife must be established by competent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere allegation that the wife has com­mitted
adultery will not bar her from the right to re­ceive support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adultery is a good defense and if properly
proved and sustained will defeat the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, at the hearing of the appli­cation for
support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
before the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court presided by the respondent
Judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Ines-Luciano</span>,
the petitioner did not present any evidence to prove the allegation that his
wife, private respondent Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes, had com­mitted
adultery with any person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has still the opportunity to adduce evidence on
the alleged adultery of his wife when the action for legal separation is heard
on the merits before the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
to be noted, however, that as pointed out by the respondents in their comment,
the "private respondent was not asking support to be taken from
petitioner's per­sonal funds or wherewithal, but from the conjugal pro­perty -
which, was her documentary evidence x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, therefore, doubtful whether adultery will affect her right to alimony <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Quintana vs. <span class="SpellE">Lerma</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the action for support was based on the obli­gation of the husband to support
his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioner that the order of the respondent
Judge granting the private respondent sup­port <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> in the amount of P4,000.00 a month is not
supported by the allegations of the complaint for legal separation and by
competent evidence has no merit. </p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint for legal separation contains allegations showing
that on at least two occasions the de­fendant, petitioner herein, had made
attempts to kill the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus it is alleged that on March 10, 1976, the defendant attacked
plaintiff, pummeled her with fist blows that floored her, held her head and
with intent to kill, bumped it several times against the cement floor and when
she ran upstairs to her father for pro­tection, the petitioner pushed her at
the stairway of thirteen (13) flights and she fell sliding to the ground floor
and defendant gave her a strong swing at her abdo­men which floored her half
unconscious and were it not for plaintiff's father, defendant would have
succeeded in killing her.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also alleged that on May 26, 1976, the defendant doused Celia <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>-Reyes with a glass of grape juice, kicked her
several times at her back and nape and was going to hit her with a steel tray
if it were not for her driver who came due to her screams for help.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fixing the amount of monthly support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> of P4,000.00, the respondent Judge did
not act capriciously and whimsically.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she originally fixed the amount of P5,000.00 a month, the
respondent Judge considered the following:</p>

<blockquote>"On record for plaintiff's cause are the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that she and de­fendant were married on
January 18, 1958; that she is presently unemployed and without funds, thus, she
is being supported by her father with whom she resides; that defendant had been
mal­treating her and tried to kill her; that all their conjugal properties are
in the possession of defendant who is also president, Manager and Treasurer of
their corporations, namely:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Standard Mineral Products, Inc. which was
incorporated on Feb­ruary 9, 1959; presently with paid-in capital of
P295,670.00; assets and liabilities of P757,108.52; Re­tained Earnings of
P85,654.61; and majority stockholder is defendant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Development and Technology Consultants, Inc. which
was incor­porated on <st1:date year="1971" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1971</st1:date>,
with paid-in capital of P200,000.00; Assets and liabilities of P831,669.34; de­fendant
owns 99% of the stocks; and last Retained Earnings is P98,879.84.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Contra-Prop Marine Phi­lippines, Inc.
which was incorporated on October 3, 1975, with paid-in ca­pital of P100,000.00
and defendant owns 99% of the stocks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To secure some of the obli­gation of said corporations, an
Agreement of Counter-Guaranty Mortgage with Real Estate, and Real Estate
Mortgage were under­taken by plaintiff and her parents of their properties
outside of other accommodations; and that she needs of P5,000.00 a month for
her support in accordance with their station in life."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The amount of support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> was reduced to P4,000.00 inasmuch as the
children are in the custody of the petitioner and are being supported by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus seen that the respondent Judge acted with due
deliberation before fixing the amount of support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> in the amount of P4,000.00 a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">In determining the amount to be awarded as support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, it
is not necessary to go fully into the merits of the case, it being sufficient
that the court ascertain the kind and amount of evidence which it may deem
sufficient to enable it to justly resolve the appli­cation, one way or the
other, in view of the merely pro­visional character of the resolution to be
entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere affidavits may satisfy the
court to pass upon the appli­cation for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It is enough that the facts be established by affidavits or other documentary
evidence appearing in the record.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent has submitted documents show­ing that the
corporations controlled by the petitioner have entered into multi-million
contracts in projects of the Ministry of Public Highways.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the high cost of living due to inflation and the
financial ability of the petitioner as shown by the documents of record, We
find that the amount of P4,000.00 a month granted by the respondent Judge as
ali­mony <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>
to the private respondent is not ex­cessive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing that the respondent Judge has committed a grave
abuse of discretion in granting said support.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated July 31, 1978, this Court issued a
temporary restraining order effective immediately against the enforcement of
the lower court's order giving support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> to private respondent in the sum of
P4,000.00 monthly commencing June 1976 and in lieu thereof to allow such
support only to the extent of P1,000.00 a month.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later the petitioner was required to pay the support at the rate
of P1,000.00 a month which had accumulated since June 1976 within ten (10) days
from notice of the resolution.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent acknowledged on November 20, 1978 having
received from the petitioner, through his counsel, a check in the amount of
P30,000.00 as payment of support for the period from June 1976 to November 1978
or thirty (30) months at P1,000.00 a month in compliance with the resolution of
this Court dated October 9, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the support of P4,000.00 should be made
to commence on <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for certiorari is hereby denied
and the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed is affirmed with
the modification that the support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> at the rate of Four Thousand Pesos (P4,000.00)
