for robbery in band with homicide before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and docketed
therein as Criminal Case No. 1830.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
trial, the court acquitted the last three-named accused on the ground of
reasonable doubt, but convicted the first two-named for the said crime,
imposing the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal by the remaining two accused,

<p class="BODY">Now, as to who committed the crime, the evidence for the prosecution
and the accused part in opposite directions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for the prosecution rests on the extrajudicial con­fession
of Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B)
and the testimony of six witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
gist of their respective testimonies (apart from what had pre­viously been
narrated as admitted or not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>) is as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Ricardo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Diacosa</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That at about sunset on 16 April 1961, while
he was pasturing his horse near a river, he saw Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>,

on 17 April 1961, Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>, while passing by the
house of <span class="SpellE">Diacosa</span>, told him to keep quiet so that he
would not be involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">T.s</span> .n<span class="GramE">. ,</span> pp. 94 ,102 -<span class="SpellE">Salamia</span>).</p>

at around eight o'clock in the moonless but starry evening of 16 April 1961 (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., p. 73-Salamia), when he passed by the unlighted
house of the late <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span>,
he saw <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, with bolos
tucked around their waists, climbing the window, while Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>

he saw them thus, he hurried away, and when he had gone about fifty meters , he
heard an explosion in the direction of the house of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.

execution by Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> of his confession to
participation in the commission of the crime, Exhibit "B", which was
read and translated to him in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> and sworn to by
the Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> in his office:
that the confession was prepared by Patrol­man Guillermo Joaquin in his
presence on 27 April 1961; and that he was the one who guided the hand of Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>, with his consent, so that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
would be impressed on Exhibit "B", (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Jesus</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>Lerasan</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>That because in the confession of Juan
<span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>, the confessant had deposed that he was given
a share of ten pesos which he placed in the wall of his kitchen, field sergeant
of police <span class="SpellE">Lerasan</span>, on orders of his chief,
accompanied <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> to his house on 28 April 1961;
that Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> did retrieve a ten-peso bill from
the kitchen wall; that when <span class="SpellE">Lerasan</span> confronted <span class="SpellE">Entrina's</span> wife about the money, she admitted non-ownership
but asserted that the money was the proceeds of her father's corn and further
remarked to her husband: "<span class="SpellE">Anto</span>, you are a
traitor to my parents." (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp. 124-­137-Salamia);
that Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> escaped from the municipal jail at
dawn on 28 April 1961, but was recaptured by his guard in the morning in <span class="SpellE">Parasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Molave</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,

detailed as guard of the town jail on 3 May 1961; that between nine <span style="">add ten o'clock in the evening, he overheard
detainee Federico <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> say to Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>, who was in another compartment of the cell:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Anto</span>, why did
you squeal or tell the authorities about the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a certain agreement not to reveal the

</span>Had we known that you will squeal we should have killed you at that time
when the offense was committed"; that <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>
replied: "You only gave money, only a small amount;" that he did not
see them talking because it was dark, but recognized their voices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.,

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">Guillermo</span></u><span style=""> <u>Joaquin</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prepared the sketch of the scene of the
crime, Exhibit "D", and identified the items indicated therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, discredited the testimony of pro­secution
witnesses Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Diacosa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dacua</span> and, in so doing, correctly made the following
pertinent remarks:</p>

<blockquote>"Granting that it is true that Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Diacusa</span>
saw these accused gathered along the corn field of Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>,
the fact remains that said witness did not hear them planning and conspiring to
rob and kill <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span>
that night of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this fact of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Diacusa</span> having seen the accused herein as testified to by
him in Court is not found in his affidavit, Exhibit 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacua</span>, the truth of his having seen and positively
identified the herein accused as the very persons seen by him at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the night of <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1961</st1:date>, in the vicinity of
the house of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span>
is open to serious doubts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night was
dark without moon, and as may bee seen from the sketch, Exhibit D, the house of
Bias Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span> is 15 meters from the nearest
trail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the condition then
obtaining, and at a distance of 15 meters, the Court can not believe that <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacua</span> could have
positively identified the persons he allegedly saw that night beyond any
possibility of mistake, much more describe their weapons and the apparel they
wore as he would want to impress upon this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacua</span> is unreliable,
considering that he is the son-in-law of one, Juan Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span>,
and he used to live in <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> in the bodega belong­ing
to <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, who as
the evidence shows, is the son-in-law of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, defense witness <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquin</span>, a 50-year old farmer of <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>,
who lives near the land of <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, testified that <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacua</span> <span style="">was </span>no
longer living in <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> in April, 1961, because he
had long transferred his residence to <span class="SpellE">Dampalan</span> in
1955; that the bodega of <span class="SpellE">Anselmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
which <span style="">was </span>used by <span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacua</span> as his residence in
<span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>, was demolished in March, 1961 and therefore,
<span class="SpellE">Candido</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacua</span> could not
have lived in <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> in the follow­ing month of
April.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galicano</span>
Sequin further testified that in going to <span class="SpellE">Dampalan</span>
from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Ma­hayag</span>,
one has to pass the barrios of San Vicente and <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it <span style="">is
</span>true as testified to by prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dacua</span>, that he was in <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span>-an
in the afternoon of April 16, 1961, and he went home late in the evening of
that day, and since he was already residing in <span class="SpellE">Dampalan</span>,
it results that from <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span>-an to his house in <span class="SpellE">Dampalan</span>, he could not have passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span> in San Vicente, and
therefore, his testimony that he saw persons in the vicinity of the house of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span> is false."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For lack of evidence, the
trial Court acquitted three of the five original accused, <span class="SpellE">Ireneo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The result
</span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that the case against appellant Federico <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> rests solely on the assertions of witness <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bogas</span>, who (as
previously related) claimed having overheard said appellant blaming Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> for revealing his participation in the latter's
confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B), as well as <span class="SpellE">Entrina's</span>
reply that he did so because he was only given a small amount out of the loot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bogas</span>, and no other witness, testified
on this point; but his testimony is uncorroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On questioning by the court, he stated that
he was four (4) meters from where <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> and
Federico <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> were conversing, through a small
hole in the wall of split lumber dividing the compartmented detention cell, but
could not see them talking because it was very dark; <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>
was alone in one com­partment, while the four other accused were in the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked what special quality
in the voice of Federico <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> that made him think
that the voice he heard was that of Federico, <span class="SpellE">Bogas</span>
evaded the question by an <span class="SpellE">uncategorical</span> and
non-responsive "Because of his voice." Yet, there is no evidence that
<span class="SpellE">Bogas</span> had gained suf­ficient familiarity with the
voice of Federico.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is unusual
that he should be able to testify that <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> and
Federico talked through a small hole when he could not even see the persons
talk­ing through that hole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp. 153-154 - <span class="SpellE">Salamia</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Uncertainty thus exists as to the veracity of the testimony of this
witness as well as to the owners of the voices that <span class="SpellE">Bogas</span>
allegedly <span class="GramE">heard,</span> which could be that of the other
persons in the prison cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The strong pro­bability of a mistaken identification cautions that
the doubt be resolved in favor of the accused Federico <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus left with the appellant Juan <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>
as sole culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even in his case,
the evidence leaves room for considerable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> lived about 200 yards from the
house of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span>;
he was the favorite son-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> and had access
to his house; <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> also operated the decedent's
corn mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said appellant,
in the morning of <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="4">17 April 1961</st1:date>,
somebody wanted to mill corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As one of
the cans was missing at the mill, he went to his father-in-law's house and
called for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He peeped thru the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw him lying, motionless; and, as his
face was upon some chicken waste, he concluded that he was dead. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He then went to inform the barrio lieutenant
and sent <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span> <span class="SpellE">Molijon</span> to
bring the news to one of the daughters of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc</span> in <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Molijon</span> was
in <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>, he met the widow, <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>
Robles, and accordingly informed her of the tragedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the 26th of<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> <span style="">was </span>fetched by a policeman to the municipal building where he
was investigated by PC Sgt. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Maderazo</span> in the
office of the mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>
claims that he was told to confess to the crime but, as he refused, he was
boxed by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maderazo</span></span><span style=""> and the chief of police; they held his hair
and inserted the barrel of a pistol into his mouth and inserted a chicken
feather into his penis, which pained and weakened him, until he fainted and
spat blood; that he did not know the contents of Exhibit "B" nor was
it read to him; that his thumb was held and guided to make a print on a piece
of paper, after which, he was brought before the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was brought to the provincial jail at
<span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>, he went to the Justice of the Peace of that
municipality and there he subscribed to an affidavit, Exhibit </span><span style="">"3"<span class="GramE">,disowning</span> </span><span style="">the
facts stated in Exhibit "B" and relating the maltreatment received by
him in <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that the ten-peso bill which Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lerasan</span>
described was not taken from the kitchen, but from his </span><span style="">own </span><span style="">pocket and was the payment for tuba.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also disclaimed any conversation with his co-accused while they were
confined in the <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> jail, contrary to what
prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bogas</span>
had testified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to note at this point, that <span class="GramE">all the</span>
original accused claimed to have likewise been maltreated, although <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> alone confessed to participating in the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not impressed by his failure to
disavow the confession to the Justice of the Peace <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> when he acknowledged the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being then under custody, it
was natural that he should fear retaliatory violence were he to denounce the
maltreatment to which he had been subjected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, assuming that <span class="SpellE">Entrina's</span> confession
was voluntary, still it fails to establish satisfactorily this appellant's
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For not only does the confession
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) <span class="GramE">reveal</span> that <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> himself re­mained downstairs of <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
Dago-<span class="SpellE">oc's</span> house, without taking a hand in the actual
killing, <span style="">but
</span>there is on record no evidence to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the acquittal of his alleged
co-conspirators leaves the truthfulness of this confession in an extremely
sorry state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, unless the
confession is believed, no evidence remains to link appellant <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> to the heinous deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already shown, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bogas</span> about overhearing
Federico <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> upbraiding <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span>
about the crime is not believable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the prosecution is not measurably helped by the
finding <span style="">by </span>police
sergeant <span class="SpellE">Lerasan</span> of a ten-peso bill (claimed to have
been <span class="SpellE">Entrina's</span> only share in the loot of P3,000.00, <span style="">a </span>circums­tance
in itself difficult to accept) in the wall of the appellant's kitchen, as
stated in the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That fact was
denied both by <span class="SpellE">Entrina</span> and his wife, who claimed that
the P10.00 had been taken from appellant's pocket and not from the wall.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Be that as it may, we are
