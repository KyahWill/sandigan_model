a term of not less than thirty years immediately preceding the date of his
petition, and at the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Larena</span>, Oriental
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
makes petitioner's <span style="">application </span>fatally
defective, it having been consistently held by this Court that petitioner's
failure to state in his petition all his residences affects the authority of
the Court to act upon his case (Yap vs. Republic, G.R. L-19832, August 23,
1966; <span class="SpellE">Nerio</span> Tan vs. Republic, G.R. L-22207, May 30, <span style="">1946; </span><span class="SpellE">Agueda</span>

<p class="BODY">Anent the fourth assignment of error, the evidence shows that
petitioner's income at the time when he filed his petition for naturalization
was only two hundred pesos per month - an amount which, according to the standard
set in previous decisions of this Court, cannot be considered lucrative.</p>
