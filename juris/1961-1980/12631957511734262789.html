				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review
on certiorari the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations in CAR
Case No. 333-TP-61, denying petitioner's motion to reopen the case and
for new trial.

  <p>On October 11, 1961, respondent Gabriel La Guardia, as
tenant, filed with the Court of Agrarian Relations a petition against
petitioner Cristina Chingay, as landholder, asking, among others, for a
reliquidation of their past harvests. To this petition, petitioner on
October 18, 1961 filed an answer admitting respondent La Guardia's
allegations as to his statue as tenant, the harvests from the land, and
the parties' contributions to the production. As defense, she alleged
that she is the owner of only one-half of the land in question.</p>
  <p>
Issues having been joined, the case was set for hearing for December
13, 1961 and January 17, 1962. On both dates, petitioner and her
counsel failed to appear in spite of due notice, so that the trial
court, upon motion and through an order dated January 17, 1962, allowed
respondent La Guardia to present his evidence, after which the case was
considered submitted for decision. Petitioner thereupon moved for
reconsideration and the trial court, in the interest of justice,
reopened the case. After several postponements, the case was again set
for hearing for June 8, 1962. Again, petitioner failed to appear and
the trial court, after allowing respondent La Guardia to present his
evidence ex-parte, for the second time considered the case submitted
for decision. On September 7, 1962, the court rendered the decision now
subject of the present petition for review. On October 18, 1962,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration asking for another
reopening of the case, alleging that she received the notice of hearing
of June 8 only on June 14, 1962, and, hence, could not be present
thereat. Her motion for reopening of the case was unaccompanied by the
required affidavit of merit. Respondent Judge, therefore, denied her
motion. Hence, this petition for review.</p>
  <p> Petitioner claims
that respondent Judge erred in refusing to reopen the case despite the
fact that her failure to attend the hearing of June 8, 1962 was caused
by lack of timely notice to her. The claim is unmeritorious. The
hearing of June 8, 1962 was not the first that petitioner failed to
attend. On two previous occasions, December 13, 1961 and January 17,
1962, she and her counsel did not appear for reasons not shown in the
record. In fact, the trial court, on the latter date, considered the
case submitted for decision. However, upon her representation, and to
give her an opportunity to be heard, the respondent Judge reopened and
reset the case for trial.After several postponements, the case was
finally re-scheduled on June 8, 1962. As already stated, she again
failed to appear. Even granting that she received notice of this last
assignment of the hearing on June 14, 1962 or 6 days after the date set
for the hearing, still she took no steps to inquire what happened on
that date and waited until the decision was rendered on September 7,
1962. This is negligence that is not excusable, considering the
antecedents of the case.</p>
  <p>Additionally, petitioner's failure
to attend on the date of hearing due to lack of appropriate notice,
supposing it to be true, would not suffice to justify the relief
provided in Section 1, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, as Section 2
thereof requires that an affidavit or affidavits of merit must be
attached to the motion as a condition <i>sine qua non</i>. Petitioner failed to comply with such requirement of Section 2, and this is fatal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The trial court, therefore, correctly refused to reopen the case.</p>
  <p>Petitioner
also asserts that respondent Judge erred in not considering her special
defense of ownership of only one-half of the land in question. Again,
the assertion is devoid of merit. In her answer, petitioner alleged
that she is the owner of only one-half of the area in dispute. This
allegation, however, was not substantiated by evidence. On the
contrary, the evidence on record clearly established the tenancy
relationship between respondent and petitioner, and no one else. It was
duly proven that it was the petitioner who took respondent as tenant to
work the land in question. From the inception of their relationship up
to the filing of this case in the court below, petitioner alone had
been sharing the produce with respondent La Guardla.</p>
  <p>For all the foregoing, the writ applied for is hereby denied, with costs against the petitioner. </p>
  <p><b>SO ORDERED</b>. </p>
