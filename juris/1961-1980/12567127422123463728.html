				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals (in its C.T.A. Case 141) 
holding petitioner Maria B. Castro liable under the War Profits Tax Law, 
Republic Act No. 55, and ordering her to pay a deficiency war profits tax 
(including surcharges and interest) in the amount of P1,360,514.68, and 
costs.
<p>The background of this case is set forth in great detail in the decision 
appealed from. We quote:</p>
<p>"Petitioner Maria B. Castro, who is authorized to manage her own property, is 
a duly licensed merchant. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 4(<i>b</i>) and 
(<i>c</i>) of Republic Act No. 55, she filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
on February 28, 1947, her war profits tax returns which showed a net worth on 
February 26, 1945 in the amount of P431,884.00 and a net worth on December 8, 
1941 in the sum of P409,581.57. Although there is indicated an increase in net 
worth in the amount of P22,302.43, she is totally exempted from paying any war 
profits tax, therefor as the deduction of six per centum (6%) per annum of the 
net worth on December 8, 1941 therefrom would show only a taxable increase in 
net worth in the amount of P5,574.61 which is not taxable under the said 
law.</p>
<p>On November 22, 1947, however, Criminal Case No. 4976 was filed against her 
in the Court of First Instance of Manila for violation of Section 4, in 
connection with Section 8, of the War Profits Tax Law, for allegedly defrauding 
the Republic of the Philippines in the total amount of P1,048,687.77. The 
criminal action was filed at the instance of respondent and simultaneous with 
the filing of said action, the petitioner receiver for the first time the notice 
of assessment dated November 19, 1947 by registered mail from the Collector of 
Internal Revenue. The said letter of demand was based on the report of 
Supervising Examiner Felipe Aquino of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, who 
recommended that the petitioner be assessed and made to pay the sum of 
P1,048,687.76 as war profits tax and surcharge, computed as follows:</p>

<p>Petitioner through counsel filed a motion to quash the criminal action 
against her and during the pendency of the same, she amended on December 20, 
1947, her original war profits tax returns making it to appear that her true net 
worth on February 26, 1945 was P315,438.32 while her net worth on December 8, 
1941 was left unchanged at P409,581.57. According to the amended return, there 
was therefore a decrease in net worth in the amount of P94,143.25 instead of an 
increase of P22,302.43 as originally reported.</p>
<p>On February 9, 1948, the motion of petitioner to quash the information was 
denied by the Court of First Instance of Manila. At the scheduled hearing of the 
case on the merits on March 7, 1949, the City Fiscal of Manila manifested in 
open court that after a re-investigation of the case "the amount of the tax due 
and for which the accused stands charged for evading payment is only about 
P700,000.00, instead of P1,048,687.76 as stated in the information." However, at 
the continuation of the hearing of the case on February 22, 1950, Supervising 
Examiner Felipe Aquino of the Bureau of Internal Eevenue who testified for the 
prosecution, declared in answer to questions propounded by the City Fiscal "that 
as a result of a detailed re-investigation conducted by his office, it was found 
out that no war profits tax was due from the accused in connection with the 
present case." Whereupon, City Fiscal Angeles moved for the dismissal of the 
case. Finding the petition for dismissal to be well-taken, the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, in an Order dated Febraury 22, 1950, dismissed Criminal Case 
No. 4976 against petitioner.</p>
<p>After the dimissai of the criminal case, another report was submitted by the 
same Supervising Examiner Felipe Aquino to his superiors wherein he changed his 
previous stand taken before the Court of First Instance of Manila, on the basis 
of which report another letter of demand for P2,008,293.53 as war profits tax 
was issued against petitioner on January 24, 1950. Barely one month thereafter, 
another report was again submitted by the same Supervising Examiner Felipe 
Aquino to his superiors, on the basis of which another letter of demand for war 
profits tax was issued by respondent against petitioner for the sum of 
P2,229,976.94 or an increase of P221,683.31 over that assessment of January 24, 
1950. The case was again referred to the City Fiscal's Office for another 
prosecution based on the earlier demand but the same was again dropped.</p>
<p>Following insistent requests of petitioner for investigation of her case, the 
then Secretary of Finance Pio Pedrosa created a committee on April 11, 1950 to 
review or re-examine the assessment for war profits tax issued against the 
petitioner. This committee, otherwise known as the Pedrosa Committee, was 
chairmanned by Atty. Artemio M. Lobrin of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, with 
Mssrs. Melecio R. Domingo and Roman M. Umali of the same office, Vivencio L. de 
Peralta of the General Auditing Office and Jose P. Alejandro of the Office of 
the Solicitor General, as members. After a through investigation of the case, 
the Pedrosa Committee on September 12, 1960, submitted its report recommending 
the collection of the amount of P3,593,950.78 as war profits tax due from 
petitioner inclusive of surcharge and interests, broken down as follows:</p>

<p>In order to enforce collection of this last mentioned assessment of 
P3,593,950.78, the respondent caused to be advertised on October 18, 1950, the 
sale at public auction on November 22, and 27, 1950, of various real properties 
of petitioner to, satisfy the war profits tax assessed against her. The 
petitioner, in order to stop the scheduled sale at public auction, filed on 
October 18, 1950, before the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for 
preliminary injunction (Civil Case No. 12356) against the Collector of Internal 
Revenue, praying, among others, than an order be issued enjoining said official 
from proceeding with the collection by summary methods of the war profits tax 
demanded. Over the objection of respondent that the Court of First Instance had 
no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint nor to issue a writ of injunction, 
the said Court entered on Order dated November 8, 1950 declaring that it had 
authority to proceed with the case but denied the petition for preliminary 
injunction. Inasmuch as no preliminary injunction was issued by the Court, 
respondent proceeded with the distraint and levy and sale at public auction of 
the properties of petitioner. These properties, which are situated in the Cities 
of Manila, Pasay, and Tagaytay and in the Municipalities of Caloocan and Makati, 
Rizal, and Moncada, Tarlac, and described more particularly in Exhibits C. C-1, 
C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-5 of the petition for injunction filed with this Court, were 
offered for sale on November 22, and 27, 1950 as scheduled, to answer for the 
war profits tax liability of petitioner to the Republic of the Philippines in 
the assessed sum of P3,593,950.78, inclusive of surcharges and interest from 
April 1, 1947 to September 30, 1950.</p>
<p>For lack of bidders on the scheduled dates of sale, the following properties 
(except those in Tagaytay) with their corresponding assessed value, were 
forfeited to the Government under Section 328 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code:</p>

<p>In another sale at public auction on April 23t 1954, the property of 
petitioner situated in Caloocan, Rizal, with an assessed value of P4,990.00 was 
also offered for sale to answer for her war profit tax liability. There being no 
bidders in this sale as in the previous sale, this last mentioned real property 
of petitioner was also forfeited to the Government.</p>
<p>The petitioner has not exercised her right of legal redemption with respect 
to ail .these real properties with a total assessed value of P858.440.00 which 
were sold at public auction by the respondent and forfeited in favor of the 
Government for lack of bidders.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, it may be stated that the hearing of Civil Case No. 12356 
before the Court of First Instance of Manila for Preliminary Injunction was not 
continued to its final determination by said Court as the Supreme Court in a 
decision promulgated on October 31, 1951 declared the lower court without 
jurisdiction to proceed with the trial. (Saturnino David vs. The Honorable 
Simeon Ramos and Maria B. Castro, G. R. No. L-4300).</p>
<p>In the course of the summary methods employed by the respondent to enforce 
the collection of the war profits tax liability of petitioner, the respondent 
also distrained and advertised for sale the properties of the Marvel Building 
Corporation in which the petitioner had a substantial interest. To counteract 
the move, the said corporation through counsel filed on November 30, 1950, Civil 
Case No. 12555 in the Court of First Instance of Manila wherein it sought to 
enjoin the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue from selling at public 
auction its various properties described in the complaint. While the corporation 
was able to secure the injunction from the lower court, the same was dissolved 
by the Supreme Court in its decision in G.R. No. L-5081, Marvel Building 
Corporation vs. Saturnino David, promulgated on February 24, 1954. Petitioner 
Maria B. Castro was declared therein as the sole and exclusive owner of all the 
shares of stock of the Marvel Building Corporation and all the other partners 
are her dummies.</p>
<p>In the meantime, petitioner filed on December 10, 1951, Civil Case No. 15316 
with the Court of First Instance of Manila against the respondent Collector of 
Internal Revenue for the recovery of the properties advertised for sale on 
November 22, and 27, 1950 which for lack of bidders were forfeited to the 
Government. However, before the case could be tried on the merits before said 
Court the Court of Tax Appeals was created by Republic Act No. 1125 and pursuant 
to Section 22 thereof, the record of the case was remanded for final disposition 
to this Court. This last mentioned case is now pending hearing before this 
Court.</p>
<p>At this juncture, it should be stated that again on December 22, 1951 an 
additional war profits tax was assessed against the petitioner in the sum of 
P20,425.00 based allegedly on certain amounts receivable which petitioner 
received from the Magdalena Estate, Inc. Consequently, the total war profits tax 
liability of petitioner, exclusive of surcharge and interest, as found by the 
Pedrosa Committee was increased to P1,546,518.76, itemized as follows:</p>

<p>To satisfy fully the amount of the war profits tax assessed against 
petitioner, the respondent on September 29, 1954, caused to be advertised for 
sale at public auction for November 2, 1954, other real properties of petitioner 
situated in Manila. These properties are described in detail in Appendix B of 
the petition for review filed with this Court. According to the "Amended Notice 
of Sale" (Appendix B, Petition for Review), the properties were seized, 
distrained and levied upon from petitioner "in satisfaction of internal revenue 
tax and penalties amounting to P4,539,556.26, computed as of April 30, 1954" due 
from her in favor of the Republic of the Philippines. For lack of bidders at the 
time of the scheduled! sale on November 2, 1954, the properties in question were 
forfeited to the Government under Section 328 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code for the total amount of P3,547,892.41 which was allegedly the balance of 
petitioner's tax liability as of that date.</p>
<p>For the expiration of the one-year period provided for in Section 328 of the 
National Internal Revenue Code within which petitioner may redeem the real 
properties forfeited in favor of the Governv ment in the sale at public auction 
held on November 2, 1954, the petitioner filed with this Court on September 30, 
1955, a petition for the annulment of said sale and forfeiture on the ground 
that her properties were advertised for sale on a tax claim of the Government 
far in excess of the alleged war profits tax, surcharges and penalties by 
respondent. Respondent filed his opposition to the petition and after due 
hearing where evidence was adduced in support of the petition as well as 
opposition thereto, this Court, in a resolution dated October 31, 1955, declared 
the auction sale of November 2, 1954 as well as the resulting forfeiture, null 
and void and of no legal force and effect because of the admitted discrepancy in 
the amount of tax stated to the notice of sale for which the properties were 
auctioned and the actual amount of tax assessed and demanded.</p>
<p>The said resolution being without prejudice to such action and proceedings a 
respondent may take in accordance with law, respondent demanded from the 
petitioner the amount of P3,594,881.51 not later than November 10, 1955 or he 
would again proceed with the resale of her properties on December 12, 1955. To 
stop the sale, petitioner filed a petition for injunction with this Court on 
November 22, 1955 requesting that respondent be enjoined from proceeding with 
the resale of her properties scheduled on December 12, 1955; that the said 
properties be released to her; and that she be declared not liable for the war 
profits tax assessed and demanded of her. After due hearing of this petition and 
the opposition thereto, this Court in a resolution dated December 10, 1955, 
denied the injunction and held in abeyance the determination. of the other 
questions until after the case shall have been heard on the merits. The 
properties were therefore advertised for sale on December 12, 1055 to answer for 
a war profits tax liability of petitioner to the Republic of the Philippines for 
the alleged amount of P3,594,307.51 computed as of that date. For lack of 
bidders, the same were forfeited to the Government. Those properties and the 
amounts for which they were forfeited are as follows:</p>

<p>From this decision, Maria Castro appealed to this Court. The nineteen alleged 
errors committed by the Court of Tax Appeals and discussed by appellant in her 
printed brief actually revolve abound four main defenses: (a) that the War 
Profits Tax Law (R.A. No. 55) is unconstitutional and void; (b) that said law 
was improperly applied to the case of the appellant; (c) that even if appellant 
were subject to the tax liability declared by the court below, such liability 
was totally extinguished by the levy and forfeiture of certain properties of 
hers; and (d) that appellant's acquittal in the criminal case instituted against 
her for violation of the War Profits Tax Law is a bar to the collection of the 
taxes assessed, and specially of the 50% surcharge.</p>
<p>(a) Petitioner's attack on the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 55, 
commonly known as the War Profits Tax Law, on account of its retrospective 
operation (Error XVIII), is now foreclosed by our decision in Republic vs. Oasan 
Vda. de Fernandez, G.R. No. L-9141, September 25, 1956, wherein this Court 
upheld the validity of the statute; and no reasons are alleged that would 
justify a departure from the ruling made in that case.</p>
<p>(b) Petitioner Castro complains (Errors I and VI) that the Tax Court had 
declared subject to the war profits tax her cash transactions from June, 1945 to 
December 31, 1946, when Republic Act No. 55 levies that tax only on the value of 
the taxpayer's assets (including real and personal property and/or cash in 
banks) as of February 26, 1945, minus his liabilities,</p>
<p>This argument misconceives the process whereby the Tax Court (and the Pedrosa 
Committee) arrived at the petitioner's net worth as of February 26, 1945. 
Because of the difficulty in determining the taxpayer's cash on hand on said 
date (since her books and records did not show her invested capital in 1945), 
said tax authorities adopted the method of starting from her reported cash on 
hand on December 31, 1946, and working backwards to February, 1945, by adding to 
the reported cash the disbursements made by Castro during 1945 and 1946, and 
then deducting her receipts from the same period. We see nothing fundamentally 
erroneous in this method, for, as pointed out in the appealed decision,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"if cash on hand at the beginning of the period, plus receipts during the 
period minus disbursements during the period, equals cash on hand at the end of 
the period, the converse must necessarily be true."</p></blockquote>
<p>Such method is in effect but an application (in reverse) of the inventory or 
net worth system that, contrary to appellant's contention (Error XIII), has been 
approved by this Court in Perez vs. Collector of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 
L-10507, May 30, 1958; Collector vs. A. P. Reyes, L-11534, November 25,, 1958; 
and Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Avelino, 113 Phil., 48.</p>
<p>The analysis of petitioner's transaction for 1945 and 1946 merely laid the 
basis for determining the undisclosed cash funds in her possession as of 
February 26, 1945 (amounting to Pl,807,444.61), and it is this cash that was 
found subject to the war profits tax.</p>
<p>It is urged, however, that even if this finding were correct, still, under 
Republic Act No. 55, only "cash in banks" is expressly mentioned as taxable, and 
appellant infers that cash on hand not so deposited was not intended to be 
subject to war profits tax. This thesis appears unmeritorious: cash held by the 
taxpayer on February 26, 1945 clearly falls under the description of "assets, 
including real and personal property" that section 2 of the Act expressly orders 
included in determining the taxable net worth. If "cash in banks" is expressly 
mentioned by the Act, it is not because cash on hand was intended to be 
excluded, but because "cash in banks" is not, strictly speaking, part of the 
assets of the taxpayer, but assets of the banks where the cash is deposited. It 
is well established that a so-called "bank deposit" is in reality a loan to the 
bank, the latter acquiring title to the amount "deposited", subject to its 
withdrawal (or recall of the loan) on the dates specified. Taxpayer's "assets", 
therefore, would not <i>per se</i> include cash deposited in banks by the 
taxpayer; and its inclusion had to be expressly prescribed by the statute in 
order to remove all doubt as to its taxability.</p>
<p>Petitioner endeavoured to show (Errors VII to XI) that part of the amount of 
cash thus arrived at actually originated in receipts from transactions made by 
her after February 26, 1945 but which were not disclosed in her books and 
accounts. Aside from the fact that this claim in her behalf contradicted her 
admission to the Pedrosa Committee that all her 1946 receipts were recorded in 
her books (v. Respondent's Exhibit 6-A), it lay within the exclusive discretion 
of the Tax Court to believe or not to believe her evidence and statements, and 
those of her witnesses regarding the source of the cash in question; and the 
rule is well settled that in cases of this kind, only errors of law, and not 
rulings on the weight of evidence, are reviewable by this Court. The same 
principle precludes us from interfering with the Tax Court's refusal to credit 
the other deductions claimed by petitioner as amountg obtained from loans from 
various individuals. The Court of Tax Appeals found those items unproved, except 
the P76,000.00 payable to Lao Kang Suy, which it accepted, although it had been 
rejected by the Pedrosa Committee.</p>
<p>Similarly, the finding that the petitioner had disbursed in 1946 
P1,025,000.00 on account of her subscription to the stock of the Marvel Building 
Corporation (Error XII) may not be disturbed by us.</p>
<p>(c) The third main ground of appeal is predicated on the acquittal of 
petitioner in case No. 4976 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, wherein 
she was criminally prosecuted for failure to render a true and accurate return 
of the war profits tax due from her, with intent to evade payment of the tax. 
She contends (Assignments of Error II to IV) that the acquittal should operate 
as a bar to the imposition of the tax and specially the 50% surcharge provided 
by section 6 of the War Profits law (R.A. No. 55), invoking the ruling in Coffey 
vs. U.S., 29 L.Ed. 436.</p>
<p>With regard to the tax proper, the state correctly points out in its brief 
that the acquittal in the criminal case could not operate to discharge 
petitioner from the duty to pay the tax, since that duty is imposed by statue 
prior to and independently of any attempts on the part of the taxpayer to evade 
payment. The obligation to pay the tax is not a mere consequence of the 
felonious acts charged in the information, nor is it a mere civil liability 
derived from crime that would be wiped out by the judicial declaration that the 
criminal acts charged did not exist.</p>
<p>As to the 50% surcharge, the very United Supreme Court that rendered the 
Coffey decision has subsequently pointed out that additions of this kind to the 
main tax are not penalties but civil administrative sanctions, provided 
primarily as a safeguard for the protection of the state revenue and to 
reimburse the government for the heavy expense of investigation and the loss 
resulting from the taxpayer's fraud (Helvering vs. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 390, 82 
L.Ed. 917; Spies vs. U.S. 317 (U.S. 492). This is made plain by the fact that 
such surcharges are enforceable, like the primary tax itself, by distraint or 
civil suit, and that they are provided in a section of R.A. No. 55 (section 5) 
that is separate and distinct from that providing for criminal prosecution 
(section 7). We conclude that the defense of jeopardy and estoppel by reason of 
the petitioner's acquittal is untenable and without merit. Whether or not there 
was fraud' committed by the taxpayer justifying the imposition of the surcharge 
is an issue of fact to be inferred from the evidence and surrounding 
circumstances; and the finding of its existence by the Tax Court is conclusive 
upon us (Gutierrez vs. Collector, G.R. No. L-9771, May 31, 1957; Perez vs. 
Collector, supra).</p>
<p>(d) The fourth main ground adduced on behalf of the petitioner (Errors II and 
XIV) is that the sale and forfeiture to the government (due to lack of bidders) 
of the properties of petitioner in Manila, Balintawak, Pasay, Makati, Tarlac, 
Tagaytay and Caloocan, which had been levied upon by the respondent Collector of 
Internal Revenue and advertised for sale in 1950 and 1954, constitutes a full 
discharge of petitioner's tax liabilities. In so arguing, she relies on the 
provisions of paragraph 1 of Section 328 of the Internal Revenue Code, reading 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 328. Forfeiture to Government for want of bidder.—In case there is no 
bidder for real property exposed for sale as herein above provided or if the 
highest bid is for an amount insufficient to pay the taxes, penalties, and 
costs, the provincial or city treasurer shall declare the property forfeited to 
the Government in satisfaction of the claim in question and within two days 
thereafter shall make a return of his proceedings and the forfeiture, which 
shall be spread upon the records of his office.",</p></blockquote>
<p>and appellant contends that in the provision to the effect that in the 
absence of bidders, the property is to be "forfeited to the Government in 
satisfaction of the claim in question", the term "satisfaction" signifies 
nothing but full discharge of the taxes, penalties, and costs claimed by the 
state. Carried to its logical conclusion, this theory would permit a clever 
taxpayer, who is able to conceal most or the more valuable part of his property 
from the revenue officers, to escape payment of his tax liability by sacrificing 
an insignificant portion of his holdings; and we can not agree that in providing 
that the forfeiture of the taxpayer's distrained or levied property, for lack of 
adequate bids, should operate in satisfaction of the total tax claims even 
beyond the value of the property forfeited. That the satisfaction prescribed in 
section 328 of the Revenue Code was intended to mean only a discharge <i>pro 
tanto</i> is confirmed by the provisions of section 330 of the Revenue Code to 
the effect that "remedy by distraint of personal property and levy on realty may 
be repeated if necessary <i>until the full amount due</i>, including all 
expenses, is collected". This section makes no distinction between forfeitures 
to the Government and sales to third persons, and we are satisfied that no 
distinction was intended and that none is warranted.</p>
<p>Nor do we see that the petitioner has any ground for complaining that the 
properties forfeited were undervalued (Error XV). The relation between assessed 
value and market price being variable, it is not a matter of judicial notice. 
However, the Court of Tax Appeals appraised and forfeited properties at double 
their assessed valuation, and thereby credited her with a part payment of 
account of her tax liability in the amount of P1,716,880.00. There is no 
adequate evidence that they were worth more, petitioner's own estimates of value 
being obviously unreliable, due to her direct interest in the matter under 
investigation. Since the burden of proof lay evidently on the taxpayer, she is 
not in a position to complain in this regard.</p>
<p>It may be noted in this connection that the validity of the levy and sale of 
her properties in November of 1950 and April 1954 is assailed by appellant in 
her fifth assignment of error; but as this point was not raised in the Court 
below, the same can not be entertained for the first time on appeal.</p>
<p>(e) As pointed out by the counsel for the Government, appellant's stand that 
the undeclared cash should be averaged or spread out for the years 1945, 1946 
and 1947 (Error XVI) assumes that what was being subjected to tax was her 
undeclared income during said years, which is not correct, as previously 
declared in this opinion. If her expenditures during 1945 and 1946 was 
scrutinized and analyzed, it was merely to determine the actual value of her 
taxable net worth as of February 26, 1945, that was subject to the war profits 
tax, as representing accumulated profits earned during the occupation years.</p>
<p>Finally, no argument is needed to show that unless taxes are to be left at 
the discretion of the taxpayer, she can not be allowed to seek refuge or relief 
by pleading (Error XVII) the alleged inefficient and erratic manner in which her 
books to the requirements of the revenue laws; and that it is incredible that a 
trader like the appellant should be able to do business running into millions of 
pesos without knowing exactly her financial condition.</p>
<p>Appellant's alleged Error XIX, being merely <i>pro forma</i>, requires no 
discussion.</p>
<p>Finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, we hereby affirm 
the same, with costs against appellant.</p>

<p><b>Reyes, J. B. L., J.:</b></p>
<p>Petitioner-appellant Maria B. Castro asks for partial reconsideration of the 
decision of this Court dated April 26, 1962, contending that the one per cent 
(1%) monthly interest on the war profits tax due from her should be limited to a 
total of thirty-six per centum (36%).</p>
<p>This contention is made to rest on the provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code on Income Tax, Section 51 (e), as amended by Republic Act No. 2343 
(approved on June 29, 1959), to the effect that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 51 (e). <i>Additions to the tax in case of nonpayment</i>.—(1) <i>Tax 
shown on the return</i>.—Where the amount determined by the taxpayer as the tax 
imposed by this Title or any installment thereof, or any part of such amount or 
installment, is not paid on or before the date prescribed for its payment, there 
shall be collected as a part of the tax, interest upon such unpaid amount at the 
rate of one <i>per centum</i> a month from the date prescribed for its payment 
until it is paid: <i>Provided,</i> That the maximum amount that may be collected 
as interest on deficiency shall in no case exceed the amount corresponding to a 
period of three years, the present provisions regarding prescription to the 
contrary notwithstanding."</p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming, without deciding, that this particular section is applicable to war 
profits taxes, we agree with the Solicitor General that there is no legal ground 
for applying retroactively to the delinquencies of the petitioner under the War 
Profits Tax Law (and which accrued since September 23, 1950, when the 
corresponding tax assessment was issued) the terms of a law (R.A. 2343) enacted 
almost nine (9) years later. It is elementary that laws are presumed to operate 
only prospectively, and have no retroactive effect in the absence of clear 
provisions to the purpose. As it stood in 1950, Section 51 (e) of the Revenue 
Code provided for monthly interest without limitation of the number of 
months:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 51 (e) <i>Surcharge and interest in case of delinquency</i>.—To any sum 
or sums due and unpaid after the dates prescribed in subsections (b), (c) and 
(d) for the payment of the same, there shall be added the sum of five <i>per 
centum</i> on the amount of tax unpaid and interest at the rate of one <i>per 
centum</i> a month upon said tax from the time the same became due, except from 
the estates of insane, deceased, or insolvent person."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner contends that the imposition of interest amounts to a penalty, and 
that laws imposing lighter penalties are given retrospective effect. We disagree 
with the basic assumption, and hold that the imposition of 1% monthly interest 
is but a just compensation to the state for the delay in paying the tax, and for 
the concomitant use by the taxpayer of funds that rightfully should be in the 
government's hands (U.S. vs. Goldstein, 189 F(2d) 752; Ross vs. U.S. 148 Fed. 
Supp. 330; U.S. vs. Joffray, 97 Fed. (2d) 488). The fact that the interest 
charged is made proportionate to the period of delay constitutes the best 
evidence that such interest is not penal but compensatory.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the petition for reconsideration must be, and hereby is 
denied.</p>
