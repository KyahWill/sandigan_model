				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an, appeal under section 13 of Republic Act No. 1267, as amended by 
section 8 of Republic Act No. 1409 to review a judgment rendered on 20 September 
1960 by the Court of Agrarian Relations, Eighth Regional District, Iloilo City, 
in CAR Case No. 959. </p>
<p>It appears that on 17 March 1960, respondent Democrito Deleonio, then 
petitioner, filed a petition (Annex A) in the Court of Agrarian Relations, 
Eighth Regional District, Iloilo City, alleging that; he is the owner of a 
parcel of agricultural land, containing an area of three (3) hectares, a part of 
Lot 6329 of Dumangas Cadastre, situated in barrio Solangan, municipality of 
Dumangas, province of Iloilo, worked by his tenant, then respondent Cipriano 
Defensor, now petitioner; that: he (Deleonio), a farmer by occupation, had 
notified then respondent Defensor, by means of a letter written in Visayan 
dialect dated 17 June 1958, received by the latter on 8 July 1958, and on 16 
March 1959 had filed notice with the Court of Agrarian Relations of his 
intention to cultivate the landholding personally; that as landholder, he had 
also sent by registered mail a copy of the notice to eject him (Defensor) but 
the latter refused to receive the copy of the notice so it was returned to 
petitioner Deleonio on 18 March 1959, and praying that his tenant, then 
respondent (Defensor), be ejected from the landholding so that he (petitioner 
Deleonio) could personally cultivate it and for other just and equitable 
remedies and reliefs. </p>
<p>In his answer dated 23 March 1960 (Annex B), the herein petitioner, then 
respondent, denied the <em>bona fide</em> intention of the landholder to 
cultivate the land himself personally, because aside from his other extensive 
landholdings under cultivation with hired workers, he is engaged in the purchase 
and sale of rice; and as special defenses he averred that then petitioner 
Deleonio was not the absolute owner of the landholding but merely a mortgagee 
whose right over it was to expire on the following year (1961); and that on 27 
April 1957, with the sanction or approval of the respondent Court, the same 
parties, in an amicable settlement entered into by them on 22 April 1951, agreed 
to have the land cultivated by the herein petitioner, then petitioner-tenant, 
and prayed that the petition be dismissed and that then petitioner, respondent 
herein, be ordered to pay him P100.00 as attorney's fees, and for other just and 
equitable reliefs. (CAR Case No, 939-Iloilo). </p>
<p>After hearing, the Court of Agrarian. Relations rendered judgment, the 
dispositive part of which is as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering the ejectment of the respondent 
Cipriano Defensor from the landholding in question subject to the provisions of 
Section 22(3 &amp; 4), R. A. 1199, as amended, in relation to Section 1, Rule 
13, Rules of the Court of Agrarian Relations, (p. 9, Annex C). </p></blockquote>
<p>In his motion for reconsideration of the judgment just rendered (Annex D), 
the then respondent Defensor argued that under Rep. Act No, 1199 an owner, a 
lessee, usufructuary, or a legal possessor of a landholding can eject a tenant 
if in good faith he intends to cultivate the land himself personally, but after 
the passage of Rep. Act No. 2263, the amendatory law which took effect on 19 
June 1959, a landholder who is a mere lessee, usufructuary, legal possessor, or 
a vendee <em>a retro</em> cannot eject the tenant because of such <em>bona 
fide</em> intention to cultivate the land himself personally. On 24 October 
1960, then petitioner Deleonio, now respondent, filed an opposition (Annex E) to 
the then respondent's motion for reconsideration contending that the use of the 
word "landholder-owner" in Republic Act No, 2263 should not be construed in a 
limited sense but should be given its general and full meaning so as to include 
all and every kind of ownership including that of a vendee <em>a retro</em>. On 
21 November 1960, the trial court denied the then respondent's motion for 
reconsideration (Annex F). </p>
<p>The respondent Court made the following findings and pronouncements: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a careful study of the evidence of both parties, it is our candid 
opinion that the petitioner has complied with all the mandatory provisions of 
the law regarding ejectment on the ground of personal cultivation. The law 
presumes the <em>bona fide</em> intention until the landholder-owner has failed 
to cultivate the landholding personally for at least three (3) years. It follows 
that before this eventuality comes, the presumption of <em>bona fide</em> 
intention is inherent in the filing of the petition. Much more so, because the 
petitioner has been personally working on rice lands since the age of 15 and now 
that he is 44 years old he is still physically capable to undertake the labor 
required of a tenant in the cultivation of rice field. The evidence has shown, 
that he owns three (3) hectares of land, 2 hectares of which are worked on by 
his son-in-law while the remaining one (1) hectare is personally tenanted by 
him. With the area of the landholding which is three (3) hectares, in case the 
respondent tenant is ejected, the petitioner-landholder can properly and 
efficiently work on and cultivate the landholding. The weans of livelihood of 
the petitioner is not sufficient to make both ends meet, because he has 11 
children, 4 of whom are already married, but 7 are still with him, under his 
support. As a matter of fact, his son, 18 years old could not continue his 
studies in the Maritime School due to lack of means. True it is that he is 
partly engaged in selling rice in Negros Occidental, but his income therefrom, 
together with that which he has been deriving from his 1 hectare land, is not 
sufficient for the support and education of his children. x x x </p>
<p>The decision rendered in Case No, 353 between the same parties which was 
based on an amicable settlement to the effect that respondent Defensor shall 
continue as tenant of the landholding, is not a legal impediment to the filing 
of the present petition nor the agreement had with respect to the seedlings 
which took place in the second week of March, 1960. </p>
<p>The only issue to be decided in this case is purely legal, whether a 
<em>vendee-a-retro</em> can eject a tenant on the ground of personal 
cultivation. It appears on record that the landholding was sold by Ignacia 
Depakakibo to the petitioner on April 27, 1956, for a period of ten (10) years 
and with the right to repurchase within the last four (4) years. Before Republic 
Act No, 2263 took effect on June 19, 1959, a landholder may be an. owner, 
lessee, usufructuary and legal possessor, but the mandatory law R. A. 2263, says 
of "landholder-owner" as the competent person to dispossess tenant on the ground 
of personal cultivation. </p>
<p>It is admitted by evidence of both partiesthat the landholding was sold to 
the petitioner with the right, to repurchase. If this is so, the petitioner is 
the landholder of the respondent. The law does not sake any distinction on the 
ownership of the owner. It may be absolute or relative or conditional as in the 
case of the <em>pacto de retro</em>. The law simply Mentions the word owner and 
no more. As a consequence therefore, where the law does not make any 
distinction, it should be applied as it is and not interpreted as it should have 
been. In a sale with the right to repurchase, all the elements of ownership are 
transferred to the vendee, such as the petitioner in this instance, subject only 
to the right of repurchase. </p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>We greatly sympathize with the plight of the respondent because he has been 
the tenant of the landholding for decades and "this land has witnessed the birth 
of his children, the death of his family, the joys and pains of his life as a 
farmer", but the interpretation of the law is raised squarely and it is indeed 
painful that this court has reached the opinion that a vendee-a-retro as 
landholder-owner can eject a tenant on the ground of personal cultivation before 
the repurchase actually takes place." </p></blockquote>
<p>In his appeal entitled "petition for certiorari" filed 8 December 1960 ( G. 
&amp;. No. L-17812) , the herein petitioner contends that respondent Decmocrito 
Deleonio, who is a vendee a retro of the landholding, has no right to eject the 
petitioner Cipriano Defensor from it on the ground of personal cultivation, 
because only an absolute owner thereof has such right. Otherwise, the petitioner 
adds, the security of tenure of the tenant would be rendered nugatory and 
ineffectual. </p>
<p>The petitioner does not dispute the findings of the respondent Court 
regarding the notice requirements as provided for in Sec, 50 (a) o£ Republic Act 
No, 1199, as amended by Rep. Act No. 2263, and the bona fide intention or "good 
faith of respondent-landholder Deleonio to personally cultivate the landholding 
involved in CAR Case No. 959-Iloilo, entitled "Democrito Deleonio vs. Cipriano 
Defensor." </p>
<p>The only point to determine is whether the respondent Democrito Deleonio, the 
vendee a retro of the landholding, subject of the controversy, has the right to 
eject his tenant Cipriano Defensor, the herein petitioner, from said landholding 
on the ground of personal cultivation. </p>
<p>The petitioner's contention that Section 50 of Republic Act No. 1199, as 
amended by R, A, 2263, applies only to the absolute owners of agricultural lands 
and not to conditional owners like a vendee <em>a retro</em>, is without merit, 
for said section 50, which partly provides that-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 50. causes for the Dispossession of Tenant. - Any of the following, and 
no other, shall be sufficient cause for the dispossession of a tenant from his 
holdings: </p>
<p>(a) The <em>bona fide</em> intention of the landholder-owner or his relative 
within the first degree by consanguinity to cultivate the Land himself 
personally or through the employment of farm machinery and implements: Provided, 
however. That should the landholder-owner or the aforesaid relative not 
cultivate the land himself for at least three years or the landholder-owner and 
his successor in interest should fail to employ mechanical farm implements for a 
period of at least five years after dispossession of the tenant, it shall be 
presumed that he acted in bad faith and the tenant shall have the right to 
demand possession of the land and damages for any loss incurred by him because 
of said dispossession: Provided, further, That the landholder-owner or the 
aforesaid relative shall, at least one year but not more than two years prior to 
the date of his petition to dispossess the tenant under this subsection, file 
notice with the court and shall inform the tenant in writing in a language or 
dialect known to the latter of his intention to cultivate the land himself, 
either personally or through the employment of Mechanical implements: x x x. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>is clear and needs no interpretation. The law does not require that absolute 
ownership of the landholding be vested in the "landholder-owner" to give him the 
right to eject his tenant on the ground of personal cultivation or through the 
employment of farm machinery and implements. A vendee <em>a retro</em> of a 
landholding is certainly an owner thereof, subject only to a resolutory 
condition or the right of the vendor <em>a retro</em> to repurchase it if duly 
availed of by him. When Section 50(a) quoted above was amended, the vendee a 
retro was not included among those excluded, to wit: the lessee, usufructuary 
and legal possessor. </p>
<p>The argument of the petitioner that to include vendee <em>a retro</em> in the 
term "landholder-owner" found in Section 50 (a) of "R.A. 2263 is "premature and 
run counter to Article 1607 of the New Civil Code" (P. 73, Record), is without 
merit, for the provisions of said article (1607) do not deprive the vendee a 
retro of his ownership and title to the landholding, but merely requires a 
judicial order, after the vendor a retro had bean duly heard, before a 
consolidation, of ownership in the vendee a retro, upon failure of the vendor a 
retro to repurchase the landholding or to comply with the provisions of Article 
1616, may be recorded in the corresponding Registry of Property. Should the 
vendor a retro repurchase the landholding, the petitions would be entitled to be 
reinstated as tenant in the landholding. </p>
<p>The judgment under review is affirmed, without special pronouncement as to 
costs. </p>
