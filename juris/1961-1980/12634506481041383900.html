				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA Case No.
1106 (Victorias Milling Co. <span style="">vs. </span>Commissioner
of Internal Revenue), declaring that sugar bags and materials imported by the
Victorias Milling Co. from September 7, 1959 to August 26, 1960, and
subsequently used and disposed of by it <span style="">as </span>containers for the sugar sold, were not
subject to advance sales tax and ordering the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
to refund the sum of P158,269.61, without interest, both parties have appealed
to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues tendered are
identical to those posed in Case G. R. No. L-21171, Victorias Milling Co. <span style="">vs. </span>Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
decided on January 31, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal of the Revenue Commissioner (G. R. No. 24779) assails
the decision of the Tax Court in rejecting his contention that the sugar bags
and containers were imported for sale and, as such, were subject to the payment
of advance sales tax under sections 183 (b) and 190 of the Internal Revenue
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention <span style="">was already over ruled by </span>this Court
in the aforementioned case (G. R. No. L-21171) where <span style="">we held </span>that, since section 188 (d) of the Revenue Code <span style="">exempts expressly </span>from sales <span style="">tax those </span>"articles subject to
tax under section 189 <span style="">of this </span>Code",
the payment by the milling company of the 2% tax imposed by section 189, <span style="">on the <u>gross value in mone</u></span><u>y</u><span style=""> </span>of all sugar manufactured or milled
by it, <u>based on the market <span style="">value </span>or
actual selling price</u> of the article at the time it <span style="">leaves </span>the factory <span style="">or mill
warehouse, </span>necessarily results in the exclusion from sales tax of the
value of <span style="">the bags in </span>which the
sugar is contained, there being no evidence that the price of the bags <span style="">was </span>not included, or that it is
charged or sold separately from that of the sugar contained therein at the time
of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we reasoned out that, <span style="">alternatively, </span>if the price or market
value of the sugar upon which the <span style="">tax
was paid </span>by the sugar company did not include that of the bags, then the
bags were not sold by it and, therefore, there was no sale of bags to be taxed,
since no evidence exists on record that the sugar company received a separate
consideration for such bags.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of the Commissioner that the exemption of the price
of sugar under section 189 of the Revenue Code can not include that of the bags
or con­tainers, because said section mentions only the former, but not the
latter, does not take into account that there is no proof that the sugar
company deducted the value of the bags or containers in reporting the market
value or price of the sugar it sold, for purposes of the tax under section 189.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the Milling Company appealed from the Tax
Court's decision in Case G. R. No. L-24769, contending that the refund of the
protested sales tax collected by the revenue authorities should have been
ordered with payment of interest thereon, for the reason that in ruling that
the bags and materials imported by said company the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue was guilty of arbitrariness, since he had previously ruled that such
importations were exempt from sales tax.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we have concluded in the preceding case G. R. No. L-21171, the mere
fact of the reversal of a ruling previously rendered is not <u>per</u> <u>se</u>
<span style="">evidence of arbitrariness; neither is
the fact that the administrative </span><span style="">ruling
</span>is found by the courts not in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arbitrariness pre­supposes <span style="">inexcusable or obstinate </span>disregard of
legal provisions, which, in this case, <span style="">we
</span>do not think <span style="">exists, </span>the
Commissioner's holding being to some <span style="">extent,
plausible on the strict letter </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, in
its CTA Case No, 1106, is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>
