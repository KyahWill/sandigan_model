in one search warrant, to search premises "No. 292-294 (DACAY ENTERPRISES)
in <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> St. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City", and seize
fraudulently imported goods, merchandise, articles, and docu­ments pertinent to

"journals, ledgers, sales and purchase invoices, order slips, delivery
receipts, books of accounts and other papers and documents, entries of which
are at variance with each other, in violation of Sec. 336 in relation to Sec.
355, as amended, of the NIRC."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day that the search warrants were issued, NBI agents
searched the premises described in the respective warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as the NBI agents later on were to
testify, they failed to see and seize any of the goods or articles specifically
mentioned in the search warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carted

court with a motion to strike down the two warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel argued that "the oaths
supporting the application for the issuance of the search warrants or the affi­davits
for the issuance of the search warrants are so general in that they do not describe
the quantity, quality and other particulars of the goods and the nature of the
books to be seized so that the said Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> is
at a loss to determine what are to be seized.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Promptly on the same day, January 15, 1966 - while Agent Chan was serving the
search warrant - the court issued what it termed a "<span class="SpellE">Clarificatory</span>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In other

bolts, or rolls of suiting materials, motorcycles, fish­ing hooks, bandanas
(ladies scarf), ladies nylon stockings, which have been fraudulently imported
and should not seize other articles not mentioned or those which have been
legally imported, considering that according to the evidence presented, this
defendant is a licensed general merchandise importer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So also, with respect to the term 'other
documents' the same must necessarily refer to the words or to the documents
enumerated immediately preceding pertinent to the goods fraudulently
imported."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A fifth search warrant simultaneously issued, this time by the
Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
directed NBI Agent Ricardo P. Robles, Jr. to search <span class="SpellE">Dacay's</span>
bodegas located in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agent
Robles carted away several bales of cloth, allegedly remnants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After examination by the customs authorities
and payment of the corresponding customs duties, they were released to <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
reexamination of these goods by customs officials was conducted at Pier 2 of
the Port of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These bales were eventually brought to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> PC
Head­quarters for storage and safekeeping.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said goods were later ordered returned to <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>
under bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>
was directed to leave with the Deputy Clerk of Court representative samples of
the contents of each bale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Came Civil Case R-9288 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> ("Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>,
Petitioner, versus Alejandro E. Mendoza, etc., et al., Respondents"), for
mandamus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case came about because <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> sought the return of the goods seized by Agent
Robles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim was that the search
warrant was null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been
rebuffed by the <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span> municipal judge, he
instituted the mandamus proceedings just adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment was, on May 28, 1969, rendered by
Judge Alfredo C. <span class="SpellE">Laya</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Court of First Instance declaring that the search warrant in question did not
des­cribe with particularity the things to be seized, and ruling that said
warrant was null and void. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><u>That</u> <u>decision</u>
<u>has</u> <u>become</u> <u>final</u>, no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
having been taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Back to the four searches made at <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seized goods, books and
documents were examined and evaluated by agents of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue and the Bureau of Customs who recommended prosecution of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> for a number of offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <u>only</u> complaint which reached
the court was that initiated by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for violation of
Section 336 in rela­tion to Section 355 of the National Internal Revenue Code
(Criminal Case V-10839, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
entitled "People of the Philippines, Plaintiff, versus Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>, Accused").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In essence, the information, filed on January 27, 1966, averred that <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> willfully and feloniously kept records and subsidiary
books of accounts pertaining to his business written in Chinese characters
without attaching thereto a true and complete trans­lation into either English,
Spanish or a native dialect, and also made entries pertaining to said business
in his books written in Chinese characters which are in material variance with
corres­ponding entries in his other books or records written in English,
Spanish or native dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case
V-10839 was, on August 15, 1969, decided by <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
court of first instance Judge Santiago O. <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verdict was one of <u>acquittal </u>for
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> took steps to nullify
the four search warrants issued by the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> court of
first instance and to get back the seized goods, books and documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this effect was his motion of January 26,
1966 in an <u>unnumbered</u> <u>criminal</u> <u>case</u> of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on March 18, 1966, he amended this motion to stop the NBI, the
State Prosecutor, the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and the
Commissioners of Internal Revenue and Customs from using as evidence any of the
goods, books and documents seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> there contended that said goods, books and documents
were different from those described in the search warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the issues joined by the People's
opposition, a hearing was had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court, on July 25, 1966, issued an order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the amended motion to declare the search and
seizure illegal, and to return the goods and documents seized is in the main
denied, except in those cases where the articles seized belonged to third
parties or were not the ones described in the warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore ordered and decreed that the searching
officers concerned, or their assistants and successors, return immediately to
their respective owners the arti­cles described in Items Nos. 1 to 9, of
Exhibit 'A', same as Exhibit '6-A' (page 87 of Record), Items 1, 4, 6 to 75 of
Exhibit 'T-5' (page 103 of Record), and Items II-A to II-EE of Exhibit 'T-2'
(page 99 of Record)."</blockquote>

the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in its order of
July 25, 1966 were not followed by NBI agents Salvador de Leon with respect to
the documents listed in the inventories designated as Annexes B, B-1 and C, and
<span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> K. Chan, Jr. in reference to those in Exhibits
P-1, P-2, T-4 and 4-A to 4-H.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed
for the nullification of the searches and the return of the documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, ruling on <span class="SpellE">Dacay's</span>
motion, issued the order of September 22, 1966 thus -</p>

granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Set this case for further

finished, and for this pur­pose the custodians of the documents listed in the
inventories of NBI Agents de Leon and Chan, Jr. are required to bring to Court
such documents as will be sufficient for examination at that particular
time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Failing in its move to reconsider, the People went direct to this
Court on <u>certiorari</u> and <u>prohibition</u> with prayer for a writ of

<p class="BODY">The <u>appeal</u> taken by the People of the Philippines from the
order of July 25, 1966 heretofore transcribed was, on Sep­tember 7, 1968,
resolved by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
respondent judge's order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied,
the People brought the case up to this Court on petition for review by

Respondents" - the other case now under consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both G.R. L-26828 and L-29567 are ripe for
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 19, 1969, respondent Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>
moved to dismiss the two cases just cited, upon the ground that the issues
raised therein have become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are now called upon to decide the cases and to rule on the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dacay's</span> motion to dismiss is founded mainly
on his acquittal in Criminal Case V-10839 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, and on the judgment, also final, of the same court in
Civil Case R-9288 nullifying the search warrant issued by the municipal judge
of <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is also the fact that the goods seized by NBI agents by virtue of
the search warrants heretofore mentioned were destroyed by the fire which
gutted the Constabulary bodega in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. To be recalled is that G.R. L-29567 is an appeal taken by the
People from the judgment of the Court of Appeals which affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the order of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> directing that the "searching officers concerned,

<p class="BODY">Exhibit A or 6-A is an inventory of the things seized by NBI

Enterprises at <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Listed therein are one bale of
clothing materials, several cases of handkerchiefs, four cases of men's socks.</p>

<p class="BODY">If only for one reason, the case as to the properties seized by
NBI Agent Aragon should be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is because these goods have been destroyed by fire which razed the PC bodega in
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since said goods (see Exhibit A or 6-A) no longer exist, then nothing
there is to discuss in L-29567.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
no more articles to return.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. L-29567, as to the goods seized by NBI Agent Aragon, has
become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the merits, the People's petition for review in L-29567 is
as vulnerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the judgment of the
Court of Appeals subject of review, the appellate court found that -</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
there is not even a single iota of evidence disclosing that the articles
actually seized by the raiding team of Aragon were in fact imported; much less
was it proven that they have been fraudulently brought into this country
through its backdoor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may sound trite
but in this jurisdiction the presumption of law is always in favor of
innocence; who­ever alleges otherwise assumes the burden of proof -- something
which the State miserably failed to accomplish in this instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This becomes more so in view of the fact that
the goods consisting of clothing materials, hand­kerchief, men's socks and
packing lists, seized by Aragon are not illegal articles <u>per</u> <u>se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that in this country we also have
a good number of textile mills which are legi­timately engaged in the
manufacture of clothing materials, handkerchiefs, and men's socks, the
possibility that those confiscated goods were locally produced is not too
remote at all so as to be lightly discounted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, since there is no positive evidence showing even <u>prima
facie</u> that the merchandise taken and seized by Aragon from the bodega of
the <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> Enterprises were illegally imported goods,
their seizure and confiscation have no basis both in fact and in law."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are bound by the foregoing finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have held in <u>Moreno</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Ago</u>
<u>Chi,</u> 12 Phil. 439, 442, that "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]f the
property was in no way connected with the commission of the offense, at the
termination of the trial it is the duty of the court to order the officer in
possession of the same to return it to the defendant."</p>

<p class="BODY">The result is the same.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>In said new trial, what <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> seeks is the

Exhibits P-1, P-2 and T-4 and also those in Exhibits 4-A to 4-H.</p>

documents seized by Chan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And amongst
these are Items 2, 3 and 5 of Exhibit T-5 - three books of accounts written in
Chinese lan­guage - which were not ordered returned by the trial court to <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The State argues that these documents would show that there was
no translation of the Chinese books of accounts into English, Span­ish or local
dialect, and that, therefore, <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> would be open for
prosecution for violation of Section 336 in connection with Section 355 of the
National Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The flaw in this argument is that <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>
was actually pro­secuted for violation of Section 355, in connection with
Section 336 of the National Internal Revenue Code, precisely in reference to
Items 2, 3 and 5 (Chinese books of accounts) in Exhibit T-5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And</u> <u>he</u> <u>was</u> <u>acquitted.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">There was no necessity then to retain the documents men­tioned in
Exhibits P-1, P-2 and T-4, and those other documents appearing in Exhibit T-2
and the rest of those in Exhibit T-5.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Exhibits P-1, P-2 and T-4, it bears remembering that in
the prosecution against <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> in Criminal Case
V-10839, solely the three books of accounts in Chinese (Nos. 2, 3 and 5,
Exhibit T-5) were presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
documents and papers covered by Exhibits P-1, P-2 and T-4 were intended to be
utilized in said case to prove the averment in the information that there was
no translation at all of those books into English, Spanish or any local
dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But said documents and papers
were never offered in evidence therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No need therefore there is to retain the items covered by Exhibits P-1,
P-2 and T-4.</p>

<p class="BODY">Five years have elapsed since the searches and seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No criminal prosecution was ever presented by
the State against <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span> except that involved in Criminal
Case V-10839 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
for failure to have his Chinese books translated into English, Spanish or local
dialect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in that case, he was
acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, no attempt has
ever been made by the State to further prosecute <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>
in relation to the books, papers and documents taken by the government men.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the duty of the State either to institute such action as it may deem
proper or to return the properties to their owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An unreasonable length of time has passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing has been done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because no further action has been taken
against <span class="SpellE">Dacay</span>, the properties so seized should be
returned to their owners.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that there exists no further cause or reason why
the two cases now before us should not be dismissed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>L-29567 on the merits and because the
questions therein involved have become moot and academic; and L-26828, it
appearing that the petition for certiorari and prohibition is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the reasons given, these two cases (G.R. L-29567 and G.R.
L-26828) are hereby dismissed, and in consequence the temporary restraining
order issued in L-26828 is dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without costs.</p>
