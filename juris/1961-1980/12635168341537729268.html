<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1963</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span> filed
with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, in the

interest".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the motion, <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>, as plaintiff
in the case, al­leged that according to the decision of the Supreme Court, the

<p class="BODY">After the parties had been given opportunity to file their
memoranda in support of their respective con­tentions, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, on <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11">Novem­ber 14, 1963</st1:date>, issued an order denying the motion of
<span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span> which
prayed for a writ of execution against the properties of defendant <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its
order of denial, the lower court stated that the statement in the decision of
this Court which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Said
respondent, however, may still recover what he has paid under the equitable
principle that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of
another" is not a part of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision but cons­titutes a part of the opinion or conclusion of
the Court, and that statement merely recognizes the existence of a right of the
plaintiff to recover what he had paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its order the lower court suggests that the proper action for the
recovery of the sum paid by the plaintiff be taken, conformable to the
recognition made by the Supreme Court of the right of the plaintiff to recover
said sum.</p>

<p class="BODY">His motion for reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="11">Novem­ber 14, 1963</st1:date> having been
denied, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>
brought the present appeal to this Court from the said order, on a question of
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question to be resolved in the present ap­peal is
whether that statement in the decision of this Court, before the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part thereof, which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Said respondent (referring to appellant
<span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>),
however, may still recover what he has paid under the equitable principle that
no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another"
may serve as a basis for the lower court to issue a writ of execution against
the properties of defendant <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>, so said
appellant may thereby recover what he had paid to said defendant. In other
words, may that state­ment be considered a judgment against defendant <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>?</p>

<p class="BODY">Let it be noted that the action brought by <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>, as plaintiff in Civil Case No. 340 in the
Court of First Instate of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, was for the recovery
of title and possession of a parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The recovery of the amount paid by <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city> was never an issue in
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was litigated in the case
was the validity of: (1) the donation of the land by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> to their daughter <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> --
because this donation was questioned by the other children of the spouses who
intervened in the case; (2) the donation of the land made by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> to her daughter <span class="SpellE">Marita</span>
Antonia <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>; and (3) the sale of the same land by
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> to <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
ruled that the two donations were valid and the sale by <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city> to <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
was null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this Court did
not order <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to pay or return to <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> the purchase price of the
land, with interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision of this Court simply
says:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, the decision complained of is reversed and the
sale of the proper­ty in controversy in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span> declared null and void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the contention of counsel for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> -- and as upheld by the lower court -- that the
portion of the decision of this Court that is relied upon by appellant <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span> in his motion for
execution is simply an opinion of the Court and does not constitute the
judgment itself.</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of a trial court a judg­ment must be
distinguished from an opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter is the informal expression of the views of the court and cannot prevail
against its final order or decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the two may be combined in one instrument, the opinion forms part
of the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So.... there is a
distinction between the findings and conclusions of a court and its judgment.
While they may constitute its decision and amount to a rendition of a judgment
they are not the judgment itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
amount to nothing more than an order for judgment, which, of course, must be
distinguished from the judgment." (Freeman on Judgments, Vol. I, 5th
Edition, page 6).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Settled is the rule in this jurisdiction that what can be the subject
of execution is that which is ordained or decreed in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of
Rosario <span class="SpellE">Neri</span> Edwards, et al., vs. Jose <span class="SpellE">Arce</span>, et al., 98 Phil. 688, 692, this Court said;</p>

<blockquote>"... In fact, the only portion of the decision that became the
subject of execution is what is ordained or decreed in such <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever may be found in the body
of the decision can only be considered as part of the reasons or conclusions of
the court and while they may serve as guide or enlightenment to determine the <u>ratio</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span>, what is controlling is what appears
in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision ...."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part
of the de­cision in question does not ordain or decree that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> should pay appellant <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span>
N. <span class="SpellE">Casilan</span> the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
with legal interest, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> committed no error when it
denied said appellant's motion for a wit of execution against the proper­ties
