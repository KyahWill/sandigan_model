Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal
convicting appellants Paterno Cruz and Benito Cruz of "rebellion with
robbery with homicide", and appellant Fermin Tolentino of "rebellion
with arson, with murder and robbery". The case is before us, the
penalty imposed upon appellants being life imprisonment.<br>
  </p>
  <p>On
or about November 23, 1953, the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal filed with
the Court of First Instance of said province an information accusing
said appellants, together with Elpidio Gantan (<em>alias </em>Marco Polo<em>, alias </em>Acosta<em>, alias </em>Maralva), Domingo, de la Torre (<em>alias  </em>Meding<em>, alias</em> Espiritu), Espiridion Salcedo  (<em>alias </em>Lafredo),  and Amado Sanchez Cruz (<em>alias</em>
Enriquez) of the "complex crime of rebellion, with multiple murder,
robberies and arsons", allegedly committed as follows: </p><blockquote>

P80,000.00 consisting of different denomination including 50-, 100-,

Party of the Philippines and those of the 'Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng
Bayan' have committed similar acts of murders, arsons and kidnappings."
</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It appears that in the evening of March 20,
1951, the Hardie Farm in the municipality of Antipolo, province of
RiIzal, was raided by Huks or members of the "Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng
Bayan" (HMB), the armed force of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, one of the aims of which is to overthrow by force of arms
the Government of the Philippines. After ransacking the place and
taking therefrom a typewriter and a radio set, as well as stationary,
clothings, foodstuffs and various other articles, the raiders tied the
hands of John D. Hardie and his foreman Donald Capuano and shot them to
death, together with Mrs. Hardie. Late the month, a combat patrolled by
Capt. Conrado M. Cabagui of the 14th BCT, with the assistance of one
Tomas Timbresa, as guide, located a Huk camp in the Sierra Madre
Mountains. The agents of the law attacked and captured the camp, in
which they found, among other objects, the radio set and the
typewriter, Exhibits A and B, taken by the dissidents from the Hardies.
</p>
  <p>Moreover, on July 26, 1951, appellants Paterno Cruz and
Benito Cruz, who are brothers, were apprehended in the barrio of San
Rafael, Montalban, Rizal, together with several other persons, by a
group of soldiers, under the command of Capt. Jose Carandang, 19th BCT.
Upon investigation, said appellants made the affidavits Exhibits V, X,
AA and Y in which they admitted being Huks. Benito Cruz further
admitted having risen to the rank of Huk Commander and being known as
Commander Saling, with 12 men under him, which was confirmed by Paterno
Cruz in his statement Exhibit Y. Moreover, Benito Cruz and some of his
men indicated the place in the mountains whereas they allegedly
defected from the HMB—they hid their arms, which were, accordingly,
recovered by the authorities. Again, Nicolas Lipunan and Tomas Timbresa
testified that they were formerly members of the HMB; that, as such,
they were detailed as "cargadores" to transport the goods and effects
looted from the Hardie Farm, when it was raided by the Huks on March
20, 1951; that Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz participated in said raid
as members of the HMB; and that (according to Lipunan) Benito Cruz was
one of the three (3) Huks who shot Mr. and Mrs. Hardie, and their
manager Donald Capuano. </p>
  <p>Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz
claimed, however, to have made and signed their aforementioned
affidavits (Exhibits X and Y) under duress. Furthermore, Paterno Cruz
denied having participated in the raid of the Hardie Farm or having any
knowledge about the Huks. Said appellants, likewise, introduced the
testimony of several residents of Montalban, who vouch safed for them
as peaceful and law abiding citizens. </p>
  <p>His Honor, the Trial
Judge, found this evidence insufficient to offset the "overwhelming
evidence for the prosecution including the confession" of said
appellants. Indeed, the latter did not identify the soldiers who
allegedly maltreated them and they showed no visible signs of
maltreatment, apart from the fact that their aforementioned affidavits
contain some exculpatory statements which are inconsistent with the
allegation of duress. Besides, nothing in the records before us
indicate a possible motive for any of the witnesses for the prosecution
to falsely inculpate appellants Benito Cruz and Paterno Cruz. In short,
we find no justification whatsoever for disturbing the conclusion
reached by the lower court with respect to the participation of Benito
Cruz and Paterno Cruz in the aforementioned raid of the Hardie Farm. </p>
  <p>Upon
the other hand, appellant Fermin Tolentino admitted being a Huk,
although he denied having held any rank or responsible position in the
organization or having adopted the name "Commander Caviteño".
Furthermore, Onofre de Jesus—a member of the HMB from 1943 to 1953 when
he surrendered, who had held responsible positions in the organization
until he became commanding officer of FC-23-testified that Tolentino
had been Commanding Officer (Co) of the Flying Squad of FC-18 in 1948,
CO of the Security Force under Linda Bie in 1949, CO of FC-25 in 1950,
G-3 of FC-25 in 1951 and again CO of FC-25 in 1052; that during the
raid of Orani, Bataan, on January 5, 1949, by the Huks, Tolentino was
one of the officers who ordered the burning of houses therein; and that
said appellant took part, also, in the Huk attack at Camp Makabulos,
Tarlac, in August 1950. </p>
  <p>Similarly, Pablo Guinto, another
former Huk, whose wife is Tolentino's aunt, testified that he (Guinto)
formed part of the band of Huks led by Tolentino that attacked Culis,
Hermosa, Bataan, on January 11, 1951; that a store was looted on that
occasion; that a Chinese was then shot and killed by Tolentino; that he
(Guinto) was likewise with the group of Huks, under the command of
Tolentino, that raided Orani sometime in 1948 or 1949, Morong, Rizal,
on April 21, 1951, and Hermosa, Bataan on December 2, 1951; and that
Tolentino was the person responsible for the killing of one Valeriano
and his son in the raid of Hermosa. </p>
  <p>Again, Capt. Julio
Dimagiba, commander of the detachment stationed at Dinalupihan, Bataan,
in August, 1949, related how he recovered the dead bodies of Baldomero
Simbulan, Antonio Cruz and an unidentified hunchback, who were victims
of the Huk attack in said municipality on August 23, 1949, and found
each corpse with a tag reading "Ako ang pumatay, Commander Caviteño",
the <em>alias</em> of appellant Tolentino, who was apprehended at an
army check point in Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal, on May 27, 1953. He
then had a gunshot wound on the breast, and tried, at first, to hide
his identity by giving a name different from his. Upon investigation,
he later confessed to having been a Huk and made the statements
Exhibits <strong>BB, CC, HH, II</strong> an <strong>JJ</strong>, in
which he admitted having been the Commanding Officer of FC-25 and being
known as Commander Caviteño. While under. detention, in connection with
this case, he escaped, but was recaptured somewhere in Pampanga.</p>
  <p><br>
During the trial, he testified that members of the army had maltreated
him and then forced him to sign several statements. Besides, he denied
the inscription found in the tags aforementioned, as well as having
assumed the "<em>alias</em>
Commander Caviteño" or having been with any raiding party of the HMB.
Lauro David and Remigio Soliman were, also, placed on the witness stand
by appellant Tolentino, to corroborate the latter part of his testimony.<br>
    <br>
    Commenting thereon, the lower court had the following to say:
  </p><blockquote>"The
denial and explanation proffered by the accused and his witnesses
cannot prevail over the clear and positive testimony of the State
witnesses regarding his role in the several raids staged by the HUKs in
the province of Bataan, but more particularly in the Makabulo massacre.
On top of all these, the record is replete with at least eight
confessions made by the accused Fermin Tolentino on separate occasions.
In Exhibit 'BB' taken by <em>Sgt. Rejualos</em> on May  27, 1953 and interpreted by <em>Sgt. Quiambao</em>,
the accused declared that he joined the HMB as a private, then promoted
to squad leader and later to staff officer, G-3 until he became
commander FC No. 25, Reco 2 from October, 1952 to December of the same
year; that he was armed with a revolver, caliber 38; that his men were
armed with thirty Garands and automatic carbines. Three days later, he
gave another statement Exhibit 'OO' before <em>Atty. Jose de  la Fuente</em>
wherein he explained how his unit operated in ambushing the enemy; that
during his membership, FC No. 25 had an encounter at Moron, Bataan in
1950 and at Pajo between Zambales and Bataan in 1951; that FC No. 25
had 100 man or 12 squads with Bataan as the area of operation. On June
3, 1953 the accused gave another statement, Exhibit 'PP', wherein he
admitted having joined the HMB as member in 1946 at Lubao, Pampanga;
that his reason for joining: was his disgust at his father's refusal to
allow him to go to places like Manila; that he began his career under
Commander Alexander of FC No. 18 (converted into FC No. 25). On July
14, 1963, he gave another statement, Exhibit 'HH', before <em>Lt. Estoque</em> and interpreted by  <em>Roque Lapuz</em>
wherein he re- counted offices held, the encounters mentioned in
Exhibits 'BB' and 'OO' and added that in 1950, he studied two months in
Reco 2 under Linda Bie as instructor; that he was G-8 of FC No. 25 from
July, 1951 to August, 1952. He reiterated his previous statements in an
other confession on August 18, 1953, Exhibit 'II'."</blockquote>  
  
  <p>We
are fully in accord with this view. Needless to say, apart from his
bare testimony, appellant Tolentino has not introduced any evidence on
this alleged maltreatment by agents of the law, aside from the fact
that the same is refuted by the exculpatory details contained in his
afore- mentioned statements.<br>
    <br>
  As stated  in the brief for the Government, appellants herein are guilty  of simple rebellion (People <em>vs</em>. Nava, L-9483, January 30, 1960; People <em>vs</em>.
Hernandez, 52 Off. Gaz., 4612), inasmuch as the information alleges,
and the records show that the acts imputed to them were performed as a
means to commit the crime of rebellion and in furtherance thereof,
although as Huk Commanders, appellants Benito Cruz and Fermin Tolentino
fall under the first paragraph of Article 135 of the Revised Penal
Code, which prescribes the penalty of <em>prision mayor</em> and a
fine not exceeding P20,000, whereas appellant Paterno Cruz comes under
the second paragraph of said article, which prescribes the penalty of <em>prision mayor</em> in its minimum period.  Accordingly, the penalty noted out to appellants Benito Cruz and <span class="style2">Fermin Tolentino  should be reduced to ten (10) years of <em>prision mayor,</em>
with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to pay each a fine
of P10,000, and appellant Paterno Cruz should be sentenced to six (6)
years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor,</em> with the accessory penalties prescribed by law.</span></p>
  <p>Thus
modified as to the designation of the crime committed and the penalties
the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed in all other respects,
with the proportionate part of the costs against said appellants. It is
so ordered. </p><p><em>Bengzon,  C. J., Bautista Angela,  Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes,</em> and <em>De Leon, JJ.</em>, concur.
