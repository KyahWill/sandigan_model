				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is the Motion for Reconsideration and Correction of Spelling of Petitioner's Surname filed by petitioner's counsels Attys. Amado A. Caballero and Adriano P. Montes, praying that the Court's decision of January 31, 1977 which reinstated the referee's original award granting, <em>inter alia</em>, P6,000. - disability benefits and P300. - attorney's fee be amended by correcting the misspelling of petitioner's surname from Legason to Ligason (which latter surname is the one used by petitioner in her petition and all other documents of record) and that attorney's fees representing 10% of the P6,000. - recovery be awarded as provided by section 31 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended. <p>The Court finds the motion for reconsideration to be meritorious. Insofar as the correction of the misspelling of petitioner's surname is concerned, the Clerk of Court is hereby authorized to make the necessary correction in the Court's decision of January 31, 1977 so as to correctly spell therein the surname of petitioner as Ligason (instead of Legason). </p><p>The dispositive portion of the Court's decision of January 31, 1977 is hereby amended to read as follows: </p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>"<strong>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</strong>, the decision of the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission is hereby reversed and set aside and the former award made by the Acting Labor Referee in favor of petitioner is revived and reinstated, <em>with the modification that the amount awarded as attorney's fees is increased from P300.00 to P600.00.</em> </p>&nbsp; <p>"<strong>SO ORDERED</strong>." </p> </blockquote> <p><em>Makasiar, Mu√±oz Palma, Fernandez</em>, and <em>Guerrero, JJ.</em>, concur. </p> </div>
