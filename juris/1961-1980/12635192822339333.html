				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission
in its ROI-WC No. 1830 wherein, upon review of the decision of its Acting
Referee awarding physical disability benefits to petitioners upon a claim filed
by them for death benefits, the Commission reversed said decision and
completely absolved respondent company, hereinafter to be referred to as <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, from any liability under the Workmen's Compensation
Act, notwithstanding it is undisputed that the deceased, upon whom, it is unquestioned,
petitioners were dependent, died of<span style="">
tuberculosis contracted during and in the course of employment, the Commission
holding that since the deceased died more than two years after contracting the
disease, petitioners are not entitled to any death benefits and that the claim
they had filed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> could not be converted into a
claim for physical disability benefits, since none was filed by the deceased,
as to whom it was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">exclusively personal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The background facts
stated in the Commission's decision, as gathered and adopted by it from the decision
of the Acting Referee, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> worked with the respondent
company, first as an underground miner and then as a head miner from <st1:date year="1948" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1948</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="12">December <span style="">17, 1959</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The works of </span>a <span style="">miner were to timber, drill holes, put the track rails, shovel area and
blast dynamites; while the duties of a head miner were to direct the work of
the miners, mucking machine opera­tors, <span class="SpellE">muckers</span> and <span class="SpellE">timbermen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The head
miner also helped his men when they raised the timber and cap, dug the
foundation of the track rails and drilled holes.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="12">December 18,
 1959</st1:date>, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span>
blood for the first time during his employment and so he was brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Acoje</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Mines</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On said date, an x-ray examination of his
lungs was taken by Dr. Mario A. <span class="SpellE">Bataclang</span>, Jr., which
showed a finding that the patient was suffering from advance pulmonary tuber<span style="">culosis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The patient was treated in the hospital until </span><st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="3"><span style="">March
 17, 1960</span></st1:date><span style=""> because
after that date he left the hospital, although there was still a need for
further treatment of his advance pulmonary tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> asked for vacation leave but the
company denied it because he was always asking for vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the company let him sign(<span class="GramE">ed</span>) his resignation paper so that he resigned voluntarily on
</span><st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="4"><span style="">April 11, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">
and went to his home at <span class="SpellE">Bayto</span>, Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Evidence further disclosed that <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>
died on <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1962</st1:date> of
pulmonary hemorrhage due to PTB (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘<span class="GramE">A</span>’<span style="">).”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Significantly omitted
here, however, is the very relevant specific finding of the Acting Referee,
which does not appear to be denied by <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, that
when <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> left the company hospital on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="17" month="3"><span style="">March
 17, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bataclang</span>, Jr., the company physician did not issue a
release paper allowing the patient to work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As already stated, upon
these facts, the Acting Referee denied petitioners' claim for death benefits
but granted them physical disability benefits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Acoje's</span> motion for reconsideration having been
denied, the case was elevated to the Commission where Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Perez rendered the decision absolving <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> and reversing that of the Acting Referee upon the fol­lowing
rationale:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the basis of the foregoing facts, we agree with the Acting
Re­feree that the claimant and her four minor children, who are the dependents
of <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>, may no longer recover death benefits
because his death had occurred more than two years from the date his pulmonary
tuberculosis became compensable on <st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision of
law in point is Sec. 8 of the Workmen's Compensation <span style="">Act, pertinent portion of which, for conve­nience, is hereunder quoted:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'Sec. <span style="">8.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">Death Benefits.</span> - If the disease contracted or injury
received by the employee as provided in section 2 hereof causes his <span style="">death within two years from the date of such
injury or sickness, the employer shall pay the compensation to the persons
entitled thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the above-quoted provision, it can easily be gleaned
that reco­very of death benefits can only be had if two indispensable
requisites concur, and they are:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style=""> </span>That the injury or illness must satisfy the
requisite conditions prescribed in Section 2 of the Act; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style=""> </span>That death should occur within two years from
the date the injury or illness was received or contracted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While <span class="SpellE">Calado's</span> pulmonary tubercu­losis
which resulted in his death might have been aggravated by, or the result of the
nature of his employment with the respondent company, the stubborn fact
remained that he died after two years from the time his pulmonary tuberculosis
became compensable on <st1:date year="1959" day="18" month="12">December 18,
 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his depend­ents
could no longer recover any bene­fits under said Section <span style="">8 </span>of the Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, although the present claimant was denied the
benefits un­der the afore-quoted provision of law, the Acting Referee awarded
her compensation under Section 14 of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe this is error on the part of the Acting Referee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to the benefits emanating from the
dif­ferent sections of the Workmen's Compensation Act relating to physical
disability for labor, whether tempo­rary or otherwise, <u>except death benefits
under said Section 8</u>, is a right that personally belongs to the injur­ed or
sick worker and the same is not transferred to his dependent upon his
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, said right, if
not enforced by the worker concerned during his lifetime, is extinguished upon
his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following autho<span style="">rity on this particular point is very
enlightening:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Claimant contends that if she is not entitled to death benefits
she should, however, be entitled to the total disability benefits that the late
Elias <span class="SpellE">Moraña</span>, her deceased husband, should have
received before his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this
argument to be without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right
to the bene­fits emanating from the dif­ferent sections of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended, relating to the phy­sical disability for labor,
whether temporary or other­wise, except death benefits under Section <span style="">8 </span>of the said Act, is purely personal
to the injured worker and the same is not transferred to his dependents upon
his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should easily be gleaned
from the context of our Decision in <span style="">the
following case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q"><span class="GramE">“’x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisive issue involved appears to be
whether death benefits may still be recovered by the dependents of a deceased

contracted in the course of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>unajudicated</u></span><u> claim filed by his widow, claimant
in this case, seeking compensation un­der Section 14 of the Act, has become
unenforceable upon his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right
of the widow </u><u><span style="">or </span>other
dependents to </u><u><span style="">claim</span></u><u><span style=""> compensation under the Act is governed by

COMPANY."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not </span>hesitate
to reverse the Commission's de­cision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear to <span class="GramE">Us</span> that the Acting Referee's de­<span style="">cision which the Commission refused to affirm
is more </span>in consonance with the humane spirit of the Workmen's
Compensation Act as a measure of social justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, <span style="">to recognize petitioners' claim as covered by </span>the<span style=""> law, one does not have to resort to generous
liberality in construing its provisions; all that needs be done is to apply
them fairly and reasonably so that the clearly discernible noble objective of
their enactment may not be defeated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no controversy that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> was
employed with <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, that he contracted tuberculo­sis
that arose out of and in the course of such em­ployment and that he eventually
died of said illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there
any question that </span><span style="">petitioners </span><span style="">were his dependents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That tuberculosis is </span><span style="">a compensable sick­</span><span style="">ness is expressly recognized in Section 2 of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>
does not and cannot dispute the fact that from the first time <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> <span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> blood and
exhibited other symptoms of the disease, he repaired to the Company hospital
and was treated thereat; he was not cured; when he left the hospital, the
company physician refused to issue to him any release paper allowing him to
work; he asked for a sick leave, <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> denied;
instead, he was made to sign resignation papers; scarcely over two years
thereafter, he died of the same malady.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Outside of hos­pital and medical services, the record does not show that
<span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> ever paid either <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>,
in his lifetime, or </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">dependents, herein petitioners, after his
death, any compensation in any form.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> denies it is liable for any
compensation under the Workmen's Compen­sation Act; its only defense:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>prescription, because <span class="SpellE">alledgedly</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calado</span> did not file any claim during his life­time,
while, on the other hand, the fact that he died more than two years </span><span style="">after he </span><span style="">contracted tuberculosis has deprived petitioners of any right to claim
any death benefit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot countenance
such a narrow view of the Compensation Act which shuts off the human value
consi­derations animating its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It just does not appear legally sound, much less morally justifiable,
that the case of petitioners be considered as not fal­ling within the ambit of
the Act's protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fun­damental
purpose of the Act is to prescribe and estab­lish a system for the payment by
employers of compensa­tion to their employees or the dependents of the lat­</span><span style="">ter for any injury or death suffered </span><span style="">by them arising out of and in the course of
their employment, which, if availed of, it must be emphasized, excludes all
other </span><span style="">rights </span><span style="">and remedies </span><span style="">accruing to the employees or work­</span><span style="">ers, their personal representatives, dependents or near­est of kin
against the </span><span style="">employer </span><span style="">under the Civil Code and other laws.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The elaborate procedure outlined in its
provisions for effectuating such basic objective has been designed to
facilitate as much as possible</span><span style="">
the granting of the contemplated relief, surely, not to obstruct or impede the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said prescribed procedure imposes
upon both parties, the employee or his dependents, on the one hand, and the
employer, on the other, the taking of certain steps by which they can preserve
and protect their respective rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The scheme of the Act is
such that the steps required to be taken by the claimants correspond with those
to be taken by the employer and <u>vice</u> <u>versa</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injured party or his dependents are
obligated to notify the employer of the injury as soon as possible</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and to file the corresponding claim within
specified periods.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On the other hand, under Section 37 of the
Act, the employer is under duty to "keep a record of all injuries, whether
fatal or not, received by his employees in the course of their employment, when
the same come to his knowledge or attention," and "As soon as
possible after the occurrence of an injury resulting in absence from work a day
or more, the em­ployer shall give written notice thereof to the Work­men's
Compensation Commissioner on blank forms spe­cially prepared by said
Commissioner for which the em­ployer shall make requisition in due time, or in
case of necessity or emergency, or for lack of forms, on any other paper,
containing the information hereinafter prescribed." According to the
second paragraph of this same provision, the employer shall set forth in such
notice whether the liability for compensation is admitted or <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In connection with these
required notices, how­ever, the Act itself dispenses with the requirements of
notice and claim by or from the injured party under certain circumstances, such
that "in case medical, surgical, and hospital services and supplies have
been furnished voluntarily by the employer, notice of the injury or sickness
within the time limit (specified) shall not be necessary and if the employer
has voluntarily made the compensation payments, the claim for compensation to
be made within the time limits (specified) shall no longer be necessary."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is easily understandable, indeed, why the
law so provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sole and only
purpose in requiring early notice of injury and filing of a claim within the
brief periods fixed in the Act, is to afford the employer the ear­liest
opportunity to investigate the facts relating </span><span style="">to the injury and to duly controvert or oppose the claim in connection
therewith,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> thereby making it as hard as </span><span style="">it is possible to </span><span style="">do so for any false fabricated or ex­cessive
claim to be made and paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
where such opportunity appears to have been opened or afforded to the employer,
it does not matter that the statutorily required notice has not been given by
the injured party or the ones supposed to act for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by express </span><span style="">provision of the Act, "failure to (give)
or delay in giving notice shall not be a bar to </span><span style="">the proceeding .... </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">if</span></span><span style=""> it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">shown that the </span><span style="">employer,
his agent or represent­ative had knowledge of the accident or that the employer
did not suffer by such delay or failure."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In Hernandez vs. W.C.C. </span><u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">this Court held that
the </span><span style="">filing of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">request for retirement …. predicated on sickness </span><span style="">causing (the </span><span style="">worker's) disability from working substantially fulfills the
requirement of a claim ..." (p. 24) Indeed, earlier, in Manila Railroad
Co. vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission, 10 SCRA 41, this Court considered
the silence of the employer after hav­ing notice of an injury or death of any
of its workers or employees and his </span><span style="">failure to give the Commission the </span><span style="">report required </span><span style="">by
Section 37 </span><span style="">as a waiver of the
defense that the claim has been filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 44)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a matter of </span><span style="">fact, </span><span style="">failure on the part of the employer to give </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">notice to the Compensation Commis­sion required by the Act </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">an offense </span><span style="">punishable by
</span><span style="">fine</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and according </span><span style="">to Section 45, such "failure .... <span class="GramE">shall</span>
constitute a renunciation of his right to contro­vert the claim ....,"
which means that he cannot put up any defense at all, except perhaps that of
absence of employer-employee relationship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is easy to see that the reason for this is that in the same manner </span><span style="">that the employer </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">given the </span><span style="">opportunity to
prepare his defenses by requiring timely </span><span style="">notice and claim by </span><span style="">the
injured party, the latter should also be given </span><span style="">early notice of </span><span style="">the
negative stand of the employer, so that he may opportunely take the necessary
care in pre­</span><span style="">paring </span><span style="">and preserving his evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Relative to </span><span style="">these considerations, it is always important
to bear in mind that </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">obligation </span><span style="">of em­ployers to pay the </span><span style="">compensation
provided in the Act is </span><span style="">mandatory
and </span><span style="">that as a matter of public
policy ex­pressed in the Act itself, said compensation cannot be renounced or
waived by a laborer or beneficiary,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> so much so that, as this Court has already
ruled, even if the same has in fact been formally waived already by the
claimant, such waiver "cannot ….. <span class="GramE">exempt</span> (the
employer) from liability ..... <span class="GramE">in</span> view of the provi­sions
of Section 7 of Act 3428, (the Compensation Act) as amended, which considers as
null and void any con­tract or device of any sort intended to exempt the em­ployer
from all or part of the liability created by said Act."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span><span style="">true that in Luzon Stevedoring Co. v. Hon. De
Leon, 106 Phil. 562, this Court considered compliance by the claimant with
Section 24 of the Act, which re­quires the giving of notice of the injury or
death to the employer "as soon as possible" and the filing of a claim
"not later than two months after the date of injury or sickness, or in
case of death, not later than three months after death", as the
"condition prece­dent to maintenance of any compensation proceeding un­der
the Act" and that "non-compliance with that re­quirement bars
recovery for compensation." (p. 565) <span class="GramE">And</span> in the
resolution of the motion for reconsideration of the decision in <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> </span><span style="">vs.
W.</span><span style="">C.C., G.R. No. L-16490, June
29, 1963 </span><span style="">(8 </span><span style="">SCRA 352) this Court went as far as to
clarify that notwithstanding actual notice or knowledge of the injury by the
employer, such notice or knowledge does not by itself constitute </span><span style="">a claim and </span><span style="">that unless a separate claim is filed by the claimants within the
period provided <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in the Act, "an award
(would) not (be) warranted in law." <span class="GramE">(10 SCRA 14, 19.)</span>
In other words, it may be said that what the Workmen's Compensation Commission
has done in the case at bar in denying petitioners claim, is seeming­ly in line
with the above decision, it appearing that neither <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>
in his lifetime, nor said petitioners have filed the formal claim prescribed by
the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Commission has failed
to perceive, however, is that the said decisions are predicated on the fact
that the em­ployer has on his part and notwithstanding the non­compliance by
the claimants, complied with the statu­tory requirement to report the accident
causing the injury in the manner and within the period provided for in the
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, this Court warts
to make it clear now, that in line with the spirit and purpose of the
Compensation Act and consistent with the public policy therein voiced that
claims for compensable in­juries or death are not <span class="SpellE">waivable</span>,
any employer who, having actual notice or knowledge, directly or </span><span style="">indi</span><span style="">rectly, of any compensable injury or death suffered by any of his
employees or workers, violates Section 37 of the Act by failing to report the
same and to controvert its liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> within
the period stated in said section is under an inescapable obligation to pay the
corresponding compensation in full whenever and howso­ever a demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is made by the party entitled thereto, the failure
of such party to give the notice or to file the claim required by Section 24 of
the Act not­withstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that
unless this view is adopted, the public policy declaring claims for
compensation non-<span class="SpellE">waivable</span> would be open to facile
circumvention and might just as well be cast aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present case, We
have a situation wherein, as already indicated at the outset of this decision,
it is not disputed that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>, an employee of <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, "contract(ed) tuberculosis caused by such
employment" and, as a matter of fact, died <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
barely two years from the time the said sickness was diagnosed by the company
physician at the company hospital, and <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the
fact that nothing in the record shows nor is it even alleged that <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> ever reported the same, much less <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
its liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> as required by Section 37 of
the Compensation Act, and merely because <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> did
not file any claim for compensation within the period specified in Section 24
of the Act, coupled with the fact that he died more than two years from the
time the sickness was discovered, the Workmen's Compensation Commission, the
very instrumentality instituted by the Act to implement its provisions and
effectuate its hu­mane spirit and objective, held that <span class="SpellE">Calado's</span>
heirs, here­in petitioners, are not entitled to compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say the least, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot conceive how such a conclusion can be said to be within the
contemplation of the Com­pensation Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surely, this Court cannot go along with the Commission's reasoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <span class="GramE">We</span> are
surprised that the Commission has taken such a position, for as against the
precedents it has cited, namely, its own de­cisions in <span class="SpellE">Morana</span>
et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, W.C. Case No. 1617-ROI, </span><st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="1"><span style="">January
 11, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, and Maria <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Castro v. <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, Case No. 101, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="10" month="2"><span style="">February 10, 1960</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commission had it­self ruled in another
case, Plaza v. Madrigal Shipping Co., Workmen's Compensation Commission Case
No. 9578, that a failure to present a claim for compensation with­in the
statutory period is a defense which must be seasonably pleaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>,
Vol. II, 1967 ed. <span style="">p. </span>138.)</span>
We feel that to deny compensation to petitioners on the technical grounds
invoked by <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> and the Commis­sion in the appealed
decision would be intolerable and shocking to the social conscience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As <span class="GramE">We</span>
have also indicated earlier above, the Compensation Act imposes upon both the
employer and the employee or those acting for the latter the obligation to take
certain steps within respectively specified periods, when­ever an injury or
death is suffered by the employee which by its nature is compensable under the
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, accord­</span><span style="">ing to the Act, the failure of the claimant
for compensa­</span><span style="">tion, either the
employee himself or those who may act for him, to take the steps so required of
them would bar </span><span style="">recovery,
whereas, on the other hand, the failure also of </span><span style="">the employer to take the steps </span><span style="">also required of him would constitute a </span><span style="">waiver of any defenses he might otherwise </span><span style="">have against a claim </span><span style="">for compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question </span><span style="">that is posed before Us in the case at bar is plainly this, </span><span style="">inasmuch </span>as <span style="">both the employee or claimant and the employ­</span><span style="">er have failed to comply with the steps
required of them </span><span style="">by the Act,
should compensation </span><span style="">be allowed,
considering, i</span><span style="">t should be
emphasized, </span><span style="">that it is not disputed
that, by its own nature, the sickness, tuberculosis, which <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>
contracted </span><span style="">because </span><span style="">of his employment and from which </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">died is statutorily compensable?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold that it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">ob­vious that an affirmative answer to this
question </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">in­evitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Alak</span> etc. vs. Hamilton
Distillery Co., 35 SCRA 8871, We already pointed out that in deciding labor
cases, We should always be guided by the constitutional provision which ordains
that "the State shall afford protection to labor" and declares as a
principle that "the promotion of social justice to insure the well-being
and economic security of all the people should be the concern of the
State" as well as Article 24 of the Civil Code which provides that
"in all contractual, property or other relations, when one of the parties
is at a disadvantage on account of his moral de­pendence, ignorance, indigence,
mental weakness, tender age or other handicap, the courts must be vigilant for
his protection."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Such, naturally, must be
our perspective in re­solving the issues now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As between the employ­ee and the employer, no
choice is left as to who should bear the consequences prescribed by the law,
when both of them fail to comply with the mutual obligations im­posed upon them
by the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, it is the employ­er
who must assume liability, if only because it </span><span style="">is al</span><span style="">ways the employer
who can better afford it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When an
employee suffers injury, sickness or death caused by his employment, no one
should expect that in such predica­ment and faced with the possible loss of all
means of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">subsistence and support, such employee or his
dependents, not infrequently ignorant of the intricacies of the mat­ter, would
be able to give needed attention to the tech­nical requirements of the law, so
that they may be com­pensated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, an employer has all the resources and facilities by which he can
readily comply with all the technicalities of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, when a compensable injury or death
takes place, and having knowledge or notice thereof, the employer does not
report it to the Commission, it </span><span style="">does
</span><span style="">not lie in the lips of such </span><span style="">employer to allege that no claim has been
filed by the employee or his dependents because his own failure to report may </span><span style="">be considered as an attempt to escape from
the legal consequences of such injury or death and his statutory obligations <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, hence it would be moral­ly untenable to allow him
to escape liability in such circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apart from giving the claimants an oppor­tunity to adequately prepare
and preserve the evidence in support </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">their claim, the more
important purpose of the Compensation Act in requiring employers to make the
report referred to in Section 37 is to enable the Com­mission to undertake the
mission imposed upon it by the public policy contained in the Act to see to </span><span style="">it that due </span><span style="">compensation is totally paid in all instances of compen­sable injury or
death, any formal or implied waiver of the persons entitled thereto
notwithstanding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, in such a
situation where the employer has violated the Act, it is not unreasonable and
We hold it to be plainly within the spirit of the Act, to cons­true its Section
25 which provides that the notice may include the claim", in the sense
that in the cases of implied claims or excusably delayed notices, as those al­ready
ruled upon by this Court as well as in similar instances, such implied or
excusably delayed notices should be considered to be in legal contemplation, at
the same time the claims required by the Act, with the result </span><span style="">that in such situations, </span><span style="">the employer may no longer be </span><span style="">heard to invoke the defense that no claim has
been filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, <span class="GramE">We</span> have already held in many cases that there is no required
form for notices and claims for compensa­</span><span style="">tion in all instances where </span><span style="">the employer has actual know­ledge of the injury or death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See cases </span><span style="">cited under com</span><span style="">ments on
Sections 25-27 in <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, Labor, Agrarian </span><span style="">Social Legislation, 1967 ed., pp. 109-111.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before </span><span style="">closing this discussion, We wish to </span><span style="">make it very clear that although We did hold
in the cases of Lu­</span><span style="">zon
Stevedoring and <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>, referred to above, that an
</span><span style="">employer is not bound to pay
compensation if no claim </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">therefor</span></span><span style=""> has been
filed within </span><span style="">the period
specified in </span><span style="">Section 24, this
was because timely report and <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> were made
by the employers in said cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could
not have meant otherwise, since on the very day the <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We shall now turn to the
other aspect of respond­ent's position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to respondents, because <span class="SpellE">Ca­lado</span> died
more than two years after his tuberculosis </span><span style="">was first discovered or diagnosed, it would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
</span><span style="">of Section 8 of the Act which
provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 8.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Death Benefit.</span> - If
the disease contracted or injury re­ceived by the employee as provided <span style="">in Section two hereof causes his death within

pay to <span style="">the </span>per­sons entitled
thereto, or, in case there shall be none, to the person representing the
deceased employee <span style="">the burial expenses
in the amount of two hundred pesos, and shall </span>also pay to or for the
following persons, in the order of priority and during the periods hereinafter <span style="">set forth, compensation equivalent </span>to
the following percentages of the average weekly wages of the employee as
determined in Section nineteen of this Act:<span style="">&nbsp;

their corollary conclusion that Acting Referee Pedro A. de Leon erred in <span style="">holding that although petitioners may not be
entitled </span>to death compensation benefits, they may, however, <span style="">receive disability benefits corresponding to </span>the
period from the day he fell sick up to the time of <span style="">his death under </span>Section 14 of the Act <span style="">which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 14.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Total disability.</span> -
In case the injury or sickness causes temporary <span style="">total disability for la­</span>bor, the employer shall, during <span style="">such disability, pay to the injured employee
a weekly compensation </span><span style="">equivalent
to sixty <u>per</u> <u>centum</u> of his average weekly wage but not less </span><span style="">than fourteen pesos per week, except in the
case provided for in the next following paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No compensa­tion shall be allowed for the

case six thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no award of
</span><span style="">permanent disability shall take
effect until after two weeks have elapsed from the date of injury."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
reason given by the Commission for denying the claim </span><span style="">of petitioners is that "the right to the
benefits emanat­ing from the different sections of the Workmen's Compen­</span><span style="">sation Act relating to physical disability
for labor, </span><span style="">whether temporary or </span><span style="">otherwise, except death </span><span style="">benefits un­der said Section </span><span style="">8, is </span><span style="">a right that </span><span style="">personally
belongs </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the injured or sick worker and the same is
not </span><span style="">trans­ferred to his
dependents upon his death." <span class="GramE">(p. 3, Decision of the
Workmen's Compensation Commission, Annex A of the <span style="">Answer).</span></span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, in turn
argues, rather stoically, that </span><span style="">"Where,
therefore, an </span><span style="">injured or sick
employee fails to </span><span style="">file a claim
for disability benefits during his lifetime, such failure should not be laid at
the door of the </span><span style="">em­ployer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the employee slept on his rights and </span><span style="">failed to exercise them when he </span><span style="">could, the fault is his." (pp. 5-6, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Acoje's</span></span><span style=""> brief.) In other words, respondents posit
that petitioners are not </span><span style="">entitled
to any </span><span style="">compensation </span><span style="">whatsoever because whereas petitioners </span><span style="">cannot invoke </span><span style="">Section </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">since <span class="SpellE">Calado's</span>
death took place beyond the two-year period therein fixed, neither can </span><span style="">they rely on Section 14, considering that <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> did not personally or thru an authorized person file
any claim for dis­ability compensation during his lifetime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As <span class="GramE">We</span>
have already indicated earlier above, re­spondents' purely legalistic posture
can never win the sympathy of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents' approach is mani­festly inconsistent with the evident
intent of the Com­pensation Act to make employers liable for compensation for
any work-connected injury or death of any of their employees or workers which
the employers do not report </span><span style="">to
the Workmen's Compensation Commission or do not dis­claim liability for by
means of a formal <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> as required by the
Act within the period therein provi­</span><span style="">ded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, </span><span style="">had the respondent Commission only properly
analyzed all the relevant circumstances </span><span style="">of this case in </span><span style="">the
light of the considerations We have discussed in this opinion, it would have
undoubtedly realized that in law and in equity, and precisely because <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> fail­ed to comply with the mandatory requirement of
the Act for it to report <span class="SpellE">Calado<span style="">'s</span></span></span><span style=""> illness
</span><span style="">and controvert its re­sulting
liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, an omission for whose conse­quences
it should naturally suffer, <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> should be </span><span style="">deemed as having effectively filed the
required claim </span><span style="">for disability
compensation, within the meaning of </span><span style="">Section 25 of the Act, the moment he reported to the company hospital
and physician and was actually diagnosed and treated </span><span style="">thereat for tuberculosis, a statutory
compensable di</span><span style="">sease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, even assuming without deciding that, as </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Acoje</span></span><span style=""> contends and the respondent Commission has
held, </span><span style="">the right to file a claim
for disability compensation is </span><span style="">"purely
personal to the injured worker and the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">is not </span><span style="">transferred to his dependents upon his
death", We hold </span><span style="">that
petitioners may not be prejudiced by said ruling of </span><span style="">the respondent Commission, for the simple </span><span style="">reason that, as </span><span style="">a matter of law, <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>
must be considered as having act</span><span style="">ually
filed the required claim, and, in consequence, his right to compensation for
disability corresponding to the </span><span style="">period
up to his demise, had already accrued before his death and, accordingly, the
same constitutes an asset of </span><span style="">his
estate transmissible to his heirs, herein petitioners, free, on account of its
special nature, from any liens or obligations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resort to the American authorities cited by petitioner on this </span><span style="">point is </span><span style="">unnecessary because, after all, the decisions referred to would make
the transmissi­bility of the right in question dependent upon respect­ive
statutory provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We prefer to </span><span style="">lay down Our ow</span><span style="">n</span><span style=""> construction of the </span><span style="">Compensation Act of Our own country in the
sense expressed in this opinion even if there should be any contrary opinion in
other jurisdictions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is to Us indisputable
that it is the clear intention of our Workmen's Compensation Act to make it the
inescapable duty of employers to pay dis­ability compensation to any employee
and worker who suffers a work-connected injury for as long as he is so
disabled, and in the event that should such employee or worker should die later
as a result of the same injury, to pay death <span class="SpellE">behefits</span>
to his dependent heirs, in addition to the disability benefits that might have
already </span>been paid, provided <span style="">that
such death takes place within two years from the date of the injury, such that
disability bene­fits are supposed to be distinct, separate and apart from death
benefits and, consequently, the loss of the right to claim the latter because
of the expira­tion of the two-year period, should all the more pre­clude the
possibility of denial of the former, as otherwise, the public policy of the Act
of making the payment of compensation for all work-connected injuries mandatory
and non-<span class="SpellE">waivable</span> would be rend­ered nugatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, likewise, clear to Us that under the
Act, the most decisive factor in determi­ning the liability of an employer in
compensation cases </span>is <span style="">his strict
compliance with the duty to file with the Workmen's Compensation Commission,
with­in the period fixed in the Act, a corresponding no­tice of the injury or
death, whether work-connected or not, suffered by any of his employees or
workers, and to formally controvert its liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
if it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not work-connected or is otherwise totally
defective, within the time also fixed in the Act, which duty naturally begins
to attach from the mo­ment the injury comes to his knowledge in one way or
another and, particularly, when the employee avails of the medical or hospital
services which the employer </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">required by the Act to provide (Sec­tion 13)
and, consequently, the filing of a formal claim by the party entitled </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">only of secondary importance, considering that a <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
</span>may <span style="">even be filed before any
claim is made, and may, at least, be invoked only when a <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>
is duly filed by the employer, considering that the Act ex­pressly provides
that the absence of such <span class="SpellE">contro­version</span> "shall
constitute a renunciation of his right to controvert." (Sec. 45)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this juncture, <span class="GramE">We</span> note that, significantly, respondent <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>

not have relieved <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> from liability on the ground

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Lastly, <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, without making any specific assign­ment of error on
