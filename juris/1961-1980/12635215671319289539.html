Jr., against a judgment by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
in its Criminal Case No.</span> V-8955, convicting him of illegal pos­session

<blockquote>"The undersigned Assistant Provincial Fiscal and designated as
Special Prosecutor by Adminis­trative Order No. 113 of the Department of
Justice, Manila, in accordance with the provision of Section 1686 of the
Revised Administrative Code, as amended, accuses Enrique <span class="SpellE">Sollano</span>,
Jr., <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span> Laude, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Piniong</span> Laude, alias <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> Tito and <span class="SpellE">Ating</span> <span class="SpellE">Laum</span>, Jr., of the crime of Illegal Manufacture of Firearms
and Spare Parts, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about 30 March 1962, and sometime before the said
date, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring,
confederating together and helping one another, with deliberate intent of gain,
<span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously did then and
there make and manufacture firearms of different calibers and sizes or their
spare parts, and owned, possessed under their control and operate tools,
implements and machineries used in the manufacture of firearms or spare parts,
and after having finished the firearms, did then and there sell and dispose
same to un­authorized persons for gain and profit without pre­viously securing
the necessary permit from the proper authorities to manufacture, make or deal
in firearms for the purpose as provided by existing laws and re­gulations on
the matter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Appellant's co-accused <span class="GramE">were</span>
all acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts upon which appellant Enrique <span class="SpellE">Sollano</span>,
Jr., was convicted for illegal possession of firearms may be briefly stated, as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Criminal Investigation Service of the Philippine Constabulary
had received reports that firearms were being illegally manufactured in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Danao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, an agent of the Service, one <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Baring, was sent there by his chief, Major Jose <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, to verify the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Major <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> gave
Baring money with which to purchase firearms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After mingling with the inhabitants of the place for sometime, Baring
earned the confidence of appellant Enrique <span class="SpellE">Sollano</span>,
Jr. On <st1:date year="1962" day="15" month="3">15 March 1962</st1:date>, he
bought from appellant three (3) revolvers and had allegedly observed the shop
where the weapons were manufactured.</p>

<p class="BODY">Baring returned to his unit with the information he had gathered
and the three (3) revolvers he had purchased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, Major <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> decided to raid the
shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before carrying out his plan, he
sent Baring ahead to pretend to buy two (2) more revolvers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Major <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
and his men, in a civilian truck <span class="SpellE">labelled</span>
"Excursionists" arrived at the vicinity of the shop, on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="3">30 March 1962</st1:date>, all the accused
scampered away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, Baring was
testing the two (2) revolvers; Major <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
pretended to arrest him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The raiding
party confiscated some paraphernalia allegedly used in the manufacture of
firearms.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five (5) revolvers were exhibited in court as Exhibits
"A" to "E", and the trial court, finding them to be the
ones sold by appellant <span class="SpellE">Sollano</span>, Jr., to agent Baring,
convicted said appellant, not for manufacturing the said firearms but for
illegal possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues in this case are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) whether or not an accused can be convicted of illegal possession of
firearms under <span class="GramE">an information</span> for unlawful manufacture
of firearms; and (b) whether or not evidence offered to prove unlawful
manufacture of firearms can be the basis of conviction for illegal possession
of firearms.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The aforesaid two issues may be merged into the single issue as to whether or
not illegal possession is an ingredient or forms a part constituting unlawful
manu­facture of firearms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if there
is variance between the offense charged in the information and that which is
proved, the accused may be convicted of that which is proved, if it is included
in the offense charged,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span> and an offense proved is included in the offense charged
if its essential elements or ingredients constitute the offense proved.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor-General that "illegal possession
of firearms does not necessarily include illegal manufacture of firearms, yet
illegal manufacture of firearms necessarily includes illegal pos­session of
firearms"; "that one who is found liable for illegal manu­facture of
firearms cannot at the same time be held liable for illegal possession of
firearms, since the possession is inherent in manu­facturing, yet nothing
prevents an accused from being found guilty of illegal possession of firearms
but not of illegally manufacturing the same". (Brief, page 5)</p>

<p class="BODY">But appellant tenders another angle in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that in another case he has been
separately charged for illegal possession of firearms in the same Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, in its Criminal Case No.
V-8961, involving the same firearms, marked as Exhibits "A" to
"E" in Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">V-8955 (the instant case
on appeal).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no record in
the present case of the other alleged proceeding but assuming the existence
thereof, its institution and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> is no bar to
appellant's conviction in the case at bar for illegal possession of firearms;
and whether or not his present conviction would be a block to the continuance
of the other case is a question that may be ventilated there.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that an appeal in a criminal case opens the whole case
for review is invoked by the People<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> as justification for its prayer
that the Supreme Court <span class="GramE">review</span> the findings of fact of
the trial court, allegedly for the reason that the original charge of illegal
manufacture of firearms is sustained by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cannot be done because this is a direct
appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance and the Supreme Court
has no appellate jurisdiction to review findings of fact in criminal cases,
except in cases of automatic review where the penalty imposed is death or life
imprisonment.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>
The cited rule has to yield to the lack of this Court's appellate jurisdiction
to review findings of fact in direct appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS</b>, the appealed Judgment is hereby
affirmed, with costs against appellant Enrique <span class="SpellE">Sollano</span>,
Jr.</p>

conviction, be punished by imprisonment for a period of not less than one year
and one day nor more than five years, or both such imprisonment and a fine of
not less than one thousand pesos nor more than five thousand pesos, in the
discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the article
