<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MAKALINTAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Miguel <span class="SpellE">Asiain</span> was an employee of the <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> Construction Company from 1956 until his death on <st1:date year="1959" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1959</st1:date>, with a monthly
salary of P300.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his death his
widow, Judith <span class="SpellE">Asiain</span>, for herself and her minor
children, filed a petition before the Social Security Commission against the
company and its manager, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> (Case No.
78), to recover the following sums:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
P3,600.00 equivalent to one year's salary of the de­ceased; (2) P600.00
representing his unpaid salary for two months; (3) P288.00 "representing
the cash received by respondents from their laborers as contribution to the
family of the deceased;" and (4) P2,000.00 by way of attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents below moved to dismiss the petition on the
grounds that the Social Security Commission had no jurisdiction over the
subject-matter and that the petitioner Judith <span class="SpellE">Asiain</span>
had no capacity to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">Commission </span>denied the motion to
dismiss in its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="25" month="2">February 25,
 1960</st1:date> and ordered the respondents to file their answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When no answer was forthcoming, the
respondents were declared in default in an order dated <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1960</st1:date>, and the petitioners were allowed to
present their evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution of <st1:date year="1960" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1960</st1:date> the <span style="">Commission </span>declared
itself without jurisdiction to entertain the claims in the petition except the
one for the sum of P3,600, which it awarded on the basis of the evidence
adduced at the hearing and pursuant to Sec­tion 24 of Republic Act No. 1161, <span style="">as </span>amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sub­sequent motion for reconsideration
filed by the respond­ents was denied, and they elevated the case for review by
the Court of Appeals, which upon proper application issued a writ of
preliminary injunction to stop all further proceedings below, including
execution of the award.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was afterwards certified to this Court for the reason
that when the respondents below were declared in default they lost their
standing before the Commission, and not having regained the same by <span style="">a </span>motion to set aside or petition for
relief, they had no right to appeal from the default judgment; and that in any
event no questions of fact are involved and hence, if at all <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, the appeal should be directly to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The procedural issues, we believe, need not concern us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main point raised here by the <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> Construction Company, which it raised also in its
motion to dismiss before the Commission, <span style="">is
</span>that the said body had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim of P3,600,
which should have been presented before the ordinary courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim was filed under Section 24 of the
Social Security Act (R.A. 1161, <span style="">as </span>amended),
which pro­vides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Employment
records and reports</u>.? <span style="">(a) </span>Each employer shall report immediately
to the System the names, ages, civil status, occupations, salaries and
dependents of all his employees who are in his employ and who are or may later
be subject to compulsory coverage:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That if an employee sub­ject to compulsory coverage should die
or <span style="">become sick or disabled without the
System having previously received </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">report about him from his
employer, the said employer shall pay to the employee or his legal heirs
damages equivalent to the benefits to which said employee would have been
entitled had his name been reported on time by the employer to the
System."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that although the deceased Miguel <span class="SpellE">Asiain</span>
had been employed in the <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> Construction Company
since 1956 and had accomplished <span style="">SSS </span>Form E-1 (Employees' Date Record) and
transmitted the same to the said company's Manila Office, it was never filed
with the Social Security System for the reason, according to the company, that
he refused to have his share of the corresponding monthly contributions
deducted from his salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these
facts the company maintains that the deceased was not a member of the System
when he died and hence the adjudica­tion of the claim for damages under Section
24, supra, does not pertain to the Commission but to the courts of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the argument untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no ques­tion that the deceased Miguel <span class="SpellE">Asiain</span>
was subject to com­pulsory coverage in the Social Security System.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was the duty of the employer to "report immediately to the System"
his name, age, civil status, occupation, salary and dependents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compliance with this duty did not depend upon
the employee's willingness to give his share of the contribution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 24 is mandatory, to such an extent
that if the employee should die or become sick or dis­abled without the report
having been made by the employer, the latter is liable for an amount equivalent
to the benefits to which the employee would have been entitled had such report
been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the provision
uses the word "damages" in referring to the amount that may be
claimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this fact alone does not
mean that the Social Security Commission lacks jurisdiction to award the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5(a) of the Social
Security Act provides that "the filing, determination and settlement of
claims shall be governed <span style="">by </span>the
rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission;" and the rules and
regulations thus promulgated state that "the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of membership in the System, as well as the final determination and settle­ment
of claims, shall be vested in the Commission." The term "claims"
is broad enough to include a claim for "damages" under Section
24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise an employer could nullify
the jurisdiction of the Commission by the simple expedient of not making a
report as required by said Sec­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
collection of the employee's share is a duty imposed by law, and his
unwillingness to have it deducted from his salary does not excuse the
employer's failure to make the report aforesaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is precisely in this situation that the
employer is liable, and there is no question as to the amount of such liability
in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Social Security Commission is affirmed, and
the writ of preliminary injunction is dis­solved, with costs against herein
petitioner.</p>
