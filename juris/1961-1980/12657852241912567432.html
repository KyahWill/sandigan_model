<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">This is an action to compel 
defendants to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to plaintiffs a parcel of land 
situated in <span class="SpellE">Pulilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> 
which, according to plaintiffs, was merely mortgaged by <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayao</span>, their 
predecessor-in-interest, to <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span> on </span><st1:date year="1926" day="8" month="12"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">December 8, 
1926</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> in 
accordance with a public document entered into between <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span>. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendants, in their answer, 
claim that the document relied upon by the plaintiffs is not a mortgage but a 
<span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de retro</i> sale which, because of 
<span class="SpellE">Tayao's</span> failure to repurchase the property within the 
period agreed upon, ripened into an absolute sale thereby vesting the ownership 
and title of the property in <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span>. The latter claims that she had sold the property to 
her co-defendants <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> who, on their 
part, claim to have purchased it in good faith and for value. Defendants finally 
claim that since the execution of the document on December 8, 1926 the land had 
been in the possession respectively of <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span> and of spouses <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> 
Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> 
continuously, openly, peacefully, adversely and in the concept of owner, having 
declared the same in their names for taxation purposes and having paid 
religiously the taxes due thereon. They pray that the complaint be dismissed. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After hearing, the court <i>a 
quo</i> dismissed the complaint with both parties bearing their own costs and 
expenses of litigation. The case is now before us on appeal taken by the 
plaintiffs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Apolonio</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <span class="SpellE">Tayao</span>, 
during his lifetime, executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">Pascuala</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Dulay</span> a deed of sate with option to repurchase 
covering a parcel of land for a consideration of P138.79. It was expressly 
agreed upon that the land object of the sale cannot be repurchased during the 
first ten years following the execution of the sale although there is nothing 
therein which limits the period within which the repurchase may take place. In 
view of this failure to stipulate the time within which the repurchase may be 
made, plaintiffs now contend that the said clause should be considered as 
non-existent being contrary to law with the result that the contract has now 
become a mere evidence of indebtedness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Defendants apparently do not 
agree with this theory if they aver that the contract entered into between 
original parties is one which embodies a real sale option to repurchase with the 
only particularity that was there agreed upon that such repurchase could not 
effected until after the period of ten years from its execution. The fact that 
this stipulation is contrary to law does not in itself convert the contract into 
a mere evidence of indebtedness and much less one of mortgage for it would at 
most be considered as one where the repurchase is to be made within a period not 
exceeding ten years in accordance with Articles 1508 of the Civil Code of Spain 
which provides: "Should there be an agreement, the period should not exceed ten 
years." <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The case in point is that of 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <i>vs.</i> Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, 41 Phil., 342, the facts of which are on all 
fours with the present. In that case, one Jose <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> sold a parcel of land to spouses <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> Santos and <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> 
Bautista with option to repurchase for the sum of P211.00 with the express 
stipulation that the seller should not repurchase the land "until after ten 
years of its enjoyment.‚Äù In ruling that this stipulation is illicit for being 
contrary to the spirit of the law, this Court declared that it did not have the 
effect of changing the character of the transaction for the most that can be 
said is that the law should control the veiled intent of the parties in the 
sense that the period for the exercise of the right of repurchase in case there 
is an agreement should not exceed ten years from the date of contract, as may be 
gleaned from the following <i>rationale</i> of this Court: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"We think, however, that the 
document is what it purports to be; and its character is not changed by the fact 
that, as will presently he seen, the stipulation as to the time when repurchase 
may be effected contravenes the provisions of article 1508 of the Civil Code. 
When the stipulation in question is examined, it will be discovered that the 
intention of the parties was to suppress the exercise of the right of repurchase 
for the full period of ten years from the date of the contract and, 
inferentially, to allow the exercise of that right after the expiration of ten 
years. In the second paragraph of article 1508 of the Civil Code it is in effect 
provided that if there should be an agreement with respect to the time of 
repurchase, the period shall not exceed ten years. The stipulation under 
consideration offends against this provision in two particulars, namely, (1) in 
providing that the right to repurchase may be exercised after ten years shall 
have elapsed, and (2) in prohibiting the exercise of the same right during the 
whole period when, according to the statute, it might be lawfully 
exercised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The stipulation is, therefore, 
illicit; and the result is that the right of repurchase could in fact under the 
second paragraph of article 1508 of the Civil Code, have been exercised in this 
case at any time after the making of the contract and prior to the expiration of 
ten years. The law must here control over the revealed intention of the 
parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"In what has boon said we do not 
mean to declare that the parties to a contract of sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de retro</i> can not under any conditions 
lawfully suspend the exercise of the right of repurchase. Doubtless they may do 
so, provided there remains an appreciable space of time for the exercise of the 
right within the limitation allowed by law. For instance, if it were provided 
that repurchase should not be effected before five <span class="GramE">nor</span> 
after ten years from the date of contract, we see no reason for supposing the 
stipulation to be unlawful. It is different where the parties attempt totally to 
suppress the right during the whole period when it might lawfully be exercised. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"It follows from what has been 
said that under the contract before us the right of repurchase expired and the 
property consolidated in the purchaser, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> T. 
Santos and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span> Bautista or the 
successors of the latter, on </span><st1:date year="1914" day="4" month="3"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">March 4, 
1914</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It appearing that neither 
plaintiffs nor their predecessor-in-interest have exercised their right of 
redemption within the period of ten years allowed by Article 1506 of the Spanish 
Civil Code, it follows that their claim over the property has already been 
forfeited, while the title of the defendants over it has become consolidated 
with all the rights thereunto appertaining. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed with the same allocation of the costs and expenses of litigation. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Bengzon</span></i></span><i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, C.J., <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, J.P.</span></i><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and <span class="SpellE"><i>Zaldivar</i></span><i>, <span class="GramE">JJ.<span style="font-style: normal;">,</span></span></i> concur.
