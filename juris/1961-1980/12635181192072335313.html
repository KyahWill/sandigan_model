				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once more in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by the
Republic of the Philippines against the orders of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (in Nat. Case No. 752), dated 15 June 1966<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and 27 October 1966,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
we find occasion to reemphasize the need for close and jealous scrutiny by
trial courts of aliens' petitions for the privilege of naturalization as
Filipino citizens, <span style="">as </span>well as
of the evidence sub­mitted to support the same even in the absence of
opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 July 1962, <span class="SpellE">Vidasto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, a Chinese citizen, filed <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Court of First Instance a
petition for citizenship (Nat. Case No. 752) stating, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, that he was single, born in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City on 2 February 1939; that he was a salesman and insurance underwriter, with
an annual income of P4,200.00; that he did not file a declaration of intention
because he was born in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was duly published, and later on heard by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">30
 September 1963</st1:date>, upon the evidence <span style="">received, the court rendered judgment, granting the petition and
admitting applicant <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> to Philippine
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No appeal from the said
decision was taken by the State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="11">8 November 1965</st1:date>,
the applicant moved to set the case for final hearing preparatory to his taking
the corresponding oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
represented by the Solicitor General's office, then opposed the motion and
prayed for the setting aside of the decision of <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">30 September 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was alleged that the petition was fatally defective, because
applicant was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention, and that he
had also used the name <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Yee Sing, which did not
appear in the published petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
this opposition as well as the subsequent motion for reconsideration filed by
the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> were denied by the lower court, <span style="">in its </span>orders of 15 June 1966 and 27
October 1966, the Republic of the Philippines resorted to the present
proceeding, raising the same issue of the defective peti­tion and inadequacy of
the publication rendering the respondent court without jurisdiction to
entertain the applicant's motion for final hearing and to allow the latter to
take the oath.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that when applicant <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>
was studying in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
he had been using also the name Yee Sing, which did not appear in the petition
or in its publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation
of applicant is that said name was only used in his <u>Chinese</u> class,
whereas he was known in his <u>English</u> class as <span class="SpellE">Vidasto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>; that after he had left the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Chinese High School he had consistently used <span class="SpellE">Vidasto</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> in school (University of San Carlos and <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Institute of Technology) and in his business dealings;
that <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Yee Sing was not included in the published
petition because he had long ago dropped and abandoned that name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that, even if true, does not obviate the
fact that, by such omission in the publication, people who might have known him
as <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Yee Sing were deprived of the opportunity to
come to court and testify on what they knee and could say of him.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in Wong Chui vs. Republic, L-23855, 24 April 1967, 19 SCRA 805, we
overruled a similar explanation that the omitted name was only given to the
applicant by his father when he first entered school, following the Chinese
custom of choosing for a child an appropriate name on such an important
occasion as the start of schooling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There we held that the use of such other name constituted a violation of
the Anti-Alias Law (Com. Act 142) and warrants the denial of the application
for ad­mission to Philippine citizenship.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
We declare, therefore, that the non-inclusion in the petition, as published, of
the other name, <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Yee Sing, by which herein
applicant was known at one time or another, made the publication of his
application for citizenship defective, a de<span style="">ficiency that practically deprived the court of jurisdiction over the
case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, there is non-compliance with Section 5 of the Revised
Naturalization Law that requires of every applicant the filing in the office of
the Solicitor General, one year prior to the presentation of the petition in
court, of a declaration of his <u>bona fide</u> intention to become a citizen
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
unless such applicant is by law exempted from the requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such exemption is only granted to aliens that
were born in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and who have received their primary and secondary education in Philippine
public schools or recognized private educational institutions not limited to
any race or nationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applicant
herein is not within the exempted class.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the applicant's birth in the Philippines, in the absence of
record in the civil registry which was destroyed (Exhibit I), may be considered
to have been established by the affidavit and testimony in court of Dr. Gil <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ramas</span></span><span style="">, </span>the physician who attended the
delivery of the applicant, there is lack of proof that the educational
requirement has been satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that applicant <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> completed primary and
secondary education, in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
during the school years 1953-54 and 1957-58, respectively.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There is, to be sure, a certification by the Regional Superintendent of the
Bureau of Private Schools, Central <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> Districts
dated 4 March 1966,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Eastern Institute (formerly the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Chinese High School) has been admitting Filipino students and employing
Filipino teachers; and applicant has likewise submitted an unverified statement
by the director of the said school which indicates the number of Filipino and
Chinese students enrolled therein from the school year 1958-1959 to 1965-1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is to be noted that these
certifications do not cover the period when applicant was taking his primary
and secondary courses, up to 1958 (Exhibit T), and, therefore, there is no
proof that the applicant received primary and secondary, schooling in an
educational institution regularly attended by a sizeable number of Filipino
students from whom he could have imbibed or assimilated Filipino customs and
traditions, in addition to learning the basic courses in Philippine history and
civics.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the same unverified statements or certifications alone would be
insufficient to establish the percentages of Filipinos and Chinese in the
student population; not having been presented in court to stand the cross
examination of the counsel for the State, and the scrutiny and observation of
the trial court, the certification of officials of the school under
consideration amounts to nothing more than self-serving or hearsay e<span style="">vidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Considering the mandatory character of the
re­quirement on the filing of a declaration of intention, applicant's failure
to comply with it is fatal to his petition,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">since </span><span style="">he was not legally
exempt from that requirement of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court below having been duly apprised by the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, Republic of the Philippines, of the foregoing
jurisdictional defects, its issuance of the disputed orders suffers from
infirmity, making it a proper subject of <i>certiorari</i> proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where, as in this case, the incorrectness
and invalidity of the lower court's decision granting Philippine citizenship to
an alien is evident from the papers available to us, even without the elevation
of the records of the original proceeding, it becomes immaterial whether the
issue of the qualifications of the applicant have been brought to this Court by
means of a special civil action or an ordinary appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted; the orders of the
lower court of <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="6">15 June 1966</st1:date>
