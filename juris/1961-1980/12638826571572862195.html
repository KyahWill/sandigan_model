in this seventeen-year old <u>Quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Warranto</u></span>
suit which commenced on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1960</st1:date>
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> centers
on the interpretation and application of Sec. 1, R.A. 1551 which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hereafter,
all employees whose salaries are paid out of the general funds of the
municipality shall, subject to the civil service law, be appointed by the
Municipal Mayor upon the recommendation of the corresponding chief of office; <u>Provided</u>,

municipal mayor, the matter shall be submitted for action to the proper
provincial department head whose decision shall be final:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided, further</u>, That the chief of

by the mayor with the consent of the municipal council."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his complaint, petitioner herein, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>, sought his reinstatement as chief of
police of the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Matanao</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, claiming that he was validly appointed to said
position but was subsequently replaced by the respondent Municipal Mayor Cesar
U. de la Victoria with the appointment of the other respondent Cornelio de la <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> as chief of police.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance on motion of respondent-public
officials dismissed <span class="SpellE">Carillo's</span> complaint holding that
the evidence of <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> does not establish an
essential element for the validity of his appointment which is the approval or
consent of the municipal council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals but the latter
court affirmed the trial court's order of dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> facts as summarized

the petitioner-appellant notified the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Mayor
that he was not willing to serve as detached service but that he will serve

was then a regular junior teacher and regular senior teacher civil service
eligible.</blockquote>

assumed office (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D)." (pp. 1-2, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed by petitioner that the requirement of the law that
an appointment of a chief of police be made with the consent of the municipal
council was complied with in his case when the municipal council of <span class="SpellE">Matanao</span> in a special session held on <u><span style="">July 11, 1957</span></u><span style="">, </span>approved the <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span>
of personnel with his name appearing as incumbent in the position of chief of
police <u>for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1958</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such approval to all intents and purposes
constituted consent by the municipal council to his appointment, petitioner
asserts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's submittal is without legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that under the law the approval by the municipal council
of an appointment of a chief of police must be express and should appear on the
appointment itself; the consent is not to be presumed or implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the approval of the municipal council
which gives validity to the appointment extended by the municipal mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>raison</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>d'etre</u></span>
of the requirement is to be found in the nature of the functions of members of
the police force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maintenance of
peace and order is of vital concern to the community and more than any where
else appointments to the police force are to be based on integrity, honesty,
and competence of the appointees to be adjudged not only by the mayor who may
be guided solely by political considerations and personal loyalties but also by
members of the municipal council which after all is the legislative governing
body of the municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The approval
of the Commissioner of Civil Service attests solely to the appointee's civil
service eligibility, the attestation being "merely a check to assure
compliance with the civil service law."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Torres vs. The Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Malalag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, et al</u>., 1959, which the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
correctly applied in deciding this case, the arguments to the contrary of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> notwithstanding, this Court held <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that inasmuch as Torres' appointment as
patrolman showed neither approval of the municipal council nor that of the
Commissioner of <span style="">Civil </span>Service
and the right to the office cannot be based on a mere presumption, there was no
valid appointment extended to him and his petition for reinstatement
necessarily must fail.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carillo's</span>
assertion of a substantial compliance with the law loses its validity in the
face of the <span class="SpellE">uncontrovertible</span> - that the approved <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> carrying his name as chief of police <span style="">was </span>only for the fiscal <u>year
1957-58</u>, after which he <u>accepted a new appointment effective July 8,
1958</u> which was "<u>subject to the provisions of Section 1 of Republic
Act No. 1551</u>" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F, per <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the new appointment of <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>
states expressly <span style="">that </span>it is
subject to the consent <span style="">and approval of
the </span>municipal council (Sec. 1, R.A. 1551), and the record of the case is
ominously silent on the existence of such a consent, express or implied, there
is no complete appointment to speak of.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the most, pending compliance with the condition, <u>all that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> was holding was a temporary
appointment as chief of police which could be terminated at any time with or
without cause</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Taboada</u></span><u> vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Badian</span></u>,
<st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1961</st1:date>, L-14604, this
Court stated that one who holds a temporary appointment has no fixed tenure of
office; his employment can be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing
power, there being no need to show that the termination is for cause.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> was the only
one qualified to the position of chief of police as there was nobody in the
ranks of the police force of <span class="SpellE">Matanao</span> with higher
civil service eligibility than him.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
That fact, however, even if true is inconsequential, for his civil service
eligibility affords him no protection or guarantee of security of tenure of
office <u>after</u> he had accepted a conditional appointment which was
temporary in nature while the condition was not fulfilled.</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's appointment being temporary, it can be
terminated at pleasure even if he is a civil service eligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this holds true notwithstanding his badge
of eligibility for, having accepted a temporary appointment, he cannot invoke
the security of tenure guaranteed by our Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fine, to him cannot apply the safeguard
embodied in Section 32 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 which provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'No officer or employee in the <span style="">civil </span>service shall be removed or suspended
except for <u>cause as provided by law and</u> after due process.'" (<span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Hojilla</span> vs. Hon. <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city>
L. <span class="SpellE">MariÃ±o</span>, et al., L-20574, <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="2">Feb. 26, 1965</st1:date>, 13 SCRA 293, 296.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See also <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
vs. De Jesus, supra).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> argues further that
his appointment (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F) was duly attested to and
approved by the Civil Service Commissioner and it was such approval which gave
validity to his appointment.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This alleged approval is not admitted however in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, We repeat that <span class="SpellE">Carillo's</span> appointment, Exhibit F, was by its very terms
subject to Section 1, Republic Act 1551, and that the appointment was not
completed since the condition imposed by the foregoing provision of law had not
been fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An appointment becomes
complete upon the performance of the last act required by law of the appointing
power.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The last act is the approval of the municipal council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is preposterous to state that the consent
or approval of the municipal council provided for in the law can be substituted
by the approval of the appointment by the Civil Service Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of one is distinct from the
purpose of the other as We have indicated earlier.</p>

<blockquote>"The approval by both the President and the Director of the
Civil Service of 'acting' appointments does not make the appointments
permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the President or the
Director of the Civil Service to convert an 'acting' appointment into a
permanent one would infringe the <span style="">constitutional
</span>provision (Article VII, section 10 (1) limiting the power of the Chief
Executive over local governments to 'general supervision as may be provided by
law.' To change the character of a municipal appointment beyond doubt
transcends 'General supervision.'" (Juan B. Mendez vs. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, et al., L-10483, 1957, 101 Phil. 48, 49)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It now follows that inasmuch as petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>
holds no valid right or title to the position of chief of police, the dismissal
of his <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> suit is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Long standing jurisprudence upholds the rule that in a <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> proceeding the person suing must show
that he has a clear right to the office allegedly held unlawfully by
another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent that right, the lack of
qualification or eligibility of the supposed usurper is immaterial.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondent appellate court that "one who
cannot show that he is entitled to occupy a public office, lacks the legal
personality to institute <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceedings; in which case, it is not necessary to inquire into the right of
the respondent to occupy said office (<span class="SpellE">Guekeko</span> vs. Santos,
76 Phil. 237; <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nueno</span>
vs. Angeles, 76 Phil. 12)."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It is axiomatic that where there is a right, there is a remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case petitioner has not
established any right to the office he claims, hence, no remedy or relief of
reinstatement may be accorded him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, We affirm the dismissal of
petitioner's complaint without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

Petitioner-appellant cites in his brief Art. 2199 of the Revised Administrative

quoted hereunder:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"Sec. 2259.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Appointment of members of police force</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The chief of police and other members of
