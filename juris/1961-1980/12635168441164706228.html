				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Original petition for certiorari to annul several orders of Hon. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, as Judge of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Branch I, and a
writ of execution issued in pursuance thereof, as well as <span class="GramE">the</span>
sheriff's notice of sale issued and the sale made in accordance with said
orders and writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners, Maria Reyes de <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
were plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 2799 of said court, against the spouses <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> Llamas and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>
Enriquez de Llamas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint
therein, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> sought the reformation of a
deed purporting to be a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>
sale of a land of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, with an area of 720
square me­ters, to the <span class="SpellE">Llamases</span>, upon the ground that
the true agreement between the parties was merely to constitute an equitable
mort­gage to guarantee the payment of the sum of <span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,<span style="">000.00</span></span></span>
lent by the <span class="SpellE">Llamases</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>.
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sinforoso</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Anota</span>
repre­sented the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> in said court, which, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1962</st1:date>, rendered a decision
substantially as prayed for by the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Llamases</span> appealed to the Court of
Appeals, where Atty. <span class="SpellE">Jovenal</span> R. Fernandez an Atty. <span class="SpellE">Anota</span> appeared on behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1964" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1964</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"IN VIEW WHEREOF, judgment modified; the
deed <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> A is declared to be <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>; but pursuant to Art.
1606 of the New Civil Code, plaintiff is given 30 days from finality of this
judg­ment to pay unto defendant the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as redemption of the property; should she fail to do so, she shall be held to
have lost all privilege of redemption; as a consequence of this decision, all
other claim of the parties against each other are dismissed; no more
pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sometime before June 3, 1964, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
redeemed the lot in question, within the period fixed in this decision, which
had meanwhile become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon
thereafter, or on October 5, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Anota</span> filed, in
said Civil Case No. 2799 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
a petition for the payment of his attor­ney's fees, in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,480.00</span>, representing 30% of the market value of said lot,
or, in the alternative, for the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> to deed to
him one-third (1/3) thereof, that is to say, a portion of said lot of about 220
square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
objected thereto, on October 22, 1964, and prayed that the amount of the
attorney's fees be fixed by the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting upon said petition of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Anota</span> and
the opposition thereto, the court, presided over by respondent herein, Judge <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, issued an order, dated October 31, 1964, fixing
the sum of P4,000.00 as the amount of <span class="SpellE">Anota's</span> fees
and making the same a lien upon the lot adverted to above.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> sought a
reconsideration, on December 8, 1964, and prayed that the award be reduced to <span style="">P2<span class="GramE">,<span style="">000.00</span></span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anota</span> countered, on <st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1964</st1:date>, with a motion to strike out the motion for
reconsideration, upon the ground that the order of <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1964</st1:date> was already final and that a
writ for the execution thereof should, therefore, be issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By an order, dated February 27, 1965, Judge <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span> amended his order of October 31, 1964, in the
sense that the attorney's fees would be deemed re­duced to P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
if this sum were judicially consigned by the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
not later than March 20, 1964, but that, otherwise, said order of October 31,
1964, in its original form, would "stand as it is."</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of making said judicial consignation, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed, on March 16, 1965, a motion praying that
the sum of P1,420 be deducted from <span class="SpellE">Anota's</span> attorney's
fees, as his share in the redemption price and other litigation expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the last <span style="">motion could be acted upon, or on April 5, 1965, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed another motion praying that the amount of
attorney's fees be reduced to P500.00 only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Anota</span> moved, on April 12,
1965, that the order of October 31, 1964 <span class="GramE">be</span> executed,
and on May 6, 1965, that the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>, dated December 8, 1964, be stricken out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion to strike out was denied by Judge
<span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, in an order, dated May 8, 1965, in which
he, also, directed the issuance of a writ for the execution of his or­der of
October 31, 1964. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) days later, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1965</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> moved for the
reconsideration of said order of <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="5">May 8,
 1965</st1:date>, which was de­nied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>
on May 15, of the same year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
or on May 8, 1965, the corresponding writ of execution had been issued and
respondent <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Lentejas</span>,
as <u>ex</u>-<u>officio</u> sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, caused
to be published, on August 26, 1965, a notice of sale, at public auction, of
the land aforementioned, for the payment of <span class="SpellE">Anota's</span>
fees, in the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, plus the sheriff's fees
and other expenses incidental to the enforcement of said writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, or on Octo­ber 11, 1965,
sheriff <span class="SpellE">Lentejas</span> sold the land, at public auction, to
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Anota</span>, in full satisfaction of his
attorney's fees, plus the Sheriff's fees and incidental expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over eleven (11) months later, or on September 16, 1966, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> commenced the present action, against Judge <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Lentejas</span> and Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Anota</span>, to annul the aforementioned orders of October
31, 1964, February 27, and May 8 and 15, 1965, as well as the sheriff's notice
of sale dated August 26, 1965, and the sale made on October 11, 1965, upon the
ground that Judge <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span> had abused his discretion
and exceeded his jurisdiction in entertaining the claim for attorney's fees in
Civil Case No. 2799, not only be­cause said claim is allegedly "foreign to
the matter litigated" therein but, also, because the amount involved is
below the minimum origi­nal jurisdiction of Court of First Instance, and that
they (the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>) have "no appeal, nor
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordi­nary course of law" against
the acts complained of.</p>

<p class="BODY">This pretense is obviously devoid of merit, for surely, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> could have appealed from the contested orders of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Escalona</span>, and no plausible reason has been
adduced - in fact, no effort has been made - to show that an appeal would not
have been a plain, speedy and adequate remedy for the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having failed to appeal from said orders,
they may not avail of the writ of certiorari to offset the adverse effects of
their omission.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, the question whether or not a particular issue may
be taken up in a given case, is generally one addressed to the sound discretion
of the Court, to be exercised in the interest of justice, and does not affect
the jurisdiction of the court to hear and decide said question, unless there
are factors entailing a denial of due process, which do not exist in the case
at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the advisability of
passing upon <span class="SpellE">Anota's</span> claim for attorney's fees, it
should be noted that the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> have not merely
failed to object to the exercises of the lower court's jurisdiction over said
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They even asked the court to fix
the amount collectible by <span class="SpellE">Anota</span>, and later to reduce
said amount, as well as to grant some other affirmative relief in connection
therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, they are now in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to assail the propriety of the action taken by
Judge <span class="SpellE">Es­calona</span> thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then again, it is well-settled that a claim for attorney's fees
may be asserted either in the very action in which the ser­vices in question
have been rendered, or in a separate action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the first alternative is chosen, the Court may pass upon said claim,
even if its amount were less than the minimum prescribed by law for the
jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter of the case, so long as the
main action is within the jurisdiction of said court, upon the theory that the
right to recover attorney's fees is but an incident of the case in which the
services of counsel have been rendered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that the application to fix the attorney's fees is
usually made before the court which renders the judgment or may be enforced in
an independent and separate action.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We see no valid reason why a probate court cannot pass upon a proper
petition to determine attorney's fees, if the rule against multi­plicity of
suits is to be activated and if we are to con­cede that, as in the case before
us, said court is to a certain degree already familiar with the nature and
extent of the lawyer's services."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Dahlke</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court quoted, with approval, from Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the following:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in
some jurisdictions the attorney's lien upon a judgment may be established and
enforced upon an application to the court in the case wherein the judgment was
rendered, and, although it is some­times held that this lien may be enforced in
an inde­pendent action by the attorney, yet ordinarily a motion in the cause is
the proper remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attorney need not
become a party to the cause <span style="">in </span>order
to enforce his lien upon the judgment, but in a proper case he may be permitted
to intervene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a proceeding it
would be proper practice for the attorney, on being admitted as a party, to
file a petition in his own name against both plaintiff and defendant, setting
forth the particulars of his claim and lien, so that if disputed by them
answers could be filed, and the issue made up, as in other cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To the same effect, substantially, are <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
v. Court of Industrial Relations<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>,

the language used was:</p>

<blockquote>"The amount claimed by the intervener being a sum less than
$500, it is the contention of appellant that the district court had no
jurisdiction to try the cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
district court having obtained jurisdiction of the original cause, it had the
authority to dispose of all matters arising out of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a similar case, where less than $1,000 was
involved in the suit after the com­promise, the Supreme Court entertained
jurisdiction, and granted a writ, thereby indicating that the court concluded that
the amount originally sued for was the sum that fixed their jurisdiction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Railway v. <span class="SpellE">Ginther</span>,
96 Tex. 295, 72 S. W. 166.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has always
been the rule in Texas that when a court once obtains jurisdiction over the
subject-matter it has the power to adjust all rights growing out of it, even as
to the demands that are not, when standing alone, sufficient to give the court
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
