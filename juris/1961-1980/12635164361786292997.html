to the decision dated <st1:date year="1960" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1960</st1:date>,
in civil case No. 806, which decision was appealed by the defendants to the
Court of Appeals which, on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="10">October 9,

the following:</blockquote>

with an area of 2.3957 sq. <span class="SpellE">mts</span>., only, covered by TCT
No. 5159.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Lot NO. <span class="GramE">572 of the Cad.</span> Survey of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, with an area
of 4.1919 sq. <span class="SpellE">mts</span>., covered by the same TCT No. 562,
in the proportion one half (1/2) for the defendants as their share.'</p>

<blockquote>"4. That the defendants are now in the possession of 3.5381 hectares
belonging to the plaintiff as per decisions above-mentioned, which could give
him the net conservative produce of twenty (20) <span class="SpellE"><span style="">cavans</span></span><span style=""> </span>of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> every agricultural year,
excluding the expenses far seedling, harrowing, transplanting, harvesting and
tenants' share, so, from 1952 to 1963, eleven (11) years of defendants'
occupation and possession with the prejudice of the plaintiff (sic), who should
be compensated in the amount of P2,642.00 at the market price of P12.00 per <span class="SpellE">cavan</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"AS HIS SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION, THE PLAINTIFF<span style=""> </span>ALLEGES:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. That the plaintiff reproduces herein each and every allegation
of the first cause of action of this complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. That the three parcels of land object of the decisions
above-cited, annexes 'A' and ‘B’, have the total area of 7.0762 hectares with a
sugar quota of 206 from the Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount
of 103 of that sugar quota corresponds to or pertaining or it is the property
of the plaintiff as he is the declared owner of the half (1/2) of those 7.0762 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the de­fendants took possession from 1952
up to 1963, on the land in question, and, they have profited themselves, not
only the whole land of 7.0762 hectares also the sugar quota of 206, with the
prejudice of the plaintiff (sic), for this reason, the defendants should pay P7<span class="GramE">,931.00</span> to said plaintiff for the use of one half (103) of
the sugar quota.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The market price of
using a sugar quota is P7.00 per quota for one agricultural year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. That the defendants have refused to pay those amounts
above-mentioned to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the repeated demand made by
him through his undersigned counsel, and until <span style="">now, </span>the said defendants refuse to
pay those amounts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That the plaintiff on many occasions, as per the decisions,
annexes 'A' &amp; 'B', has demanded from the defendants the partition and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the half (1/2) of the land in question, the
half (1/2) of its produce and the half (1/2) of the sugar quota, but, the
defendants refused, and for this reasons, the plaintiff suffered the <span style="">following damages:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the amount of the produce of one half
(1/2) of the land and the half of sugar quota; and (b) moral damages of
P1,000.00; liquidated damages, P1,000.00, and attorney's fees, P500.00."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Plaintiff,
therefore, prayed for judgment (1) placing him in possession of one-half of the
land in question and for delivery to him of one-half of the sugar quota of said
land; (2) ordering defendants to pay the sum of P10,572.00, the value of 220 </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">cavans</span></span><span style=""> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> (he </span><span style="">was supposed to receive in 11 years), plus
P7,931.00, as payment for the use, for 11 years, of the sugar quota allegedly
pertaining to him; (3) for other equitable <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>,
and (4) for costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants moved for the
dismissal of the case, on the ground that plaintiff's causes of action were
barred by the prior judgment </span><span style="">in
Civil Case No. </span><span style="">806 of the same
court, and by <span class="GramE">prescription</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over plaintiff's opposition, the court
granted said motion of the defendants and dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was ruled that plaintiff's claim to
possession of one-half of the three parcels of land described in the complaint
and to its fruits from 1952 to 1963, should have been presented in Civil Case
No. 806 where he sued for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a half
interest of the identical lots, with damages; and plaintiff's failure to do so
barred him from bringing another action for the said purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this order, plaintiff interposed the
present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Disputing the correctness
of the ruling of the court below, plaintiff-appellant contends that the final
decision in Civil Case No. 806 does not constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the present action (Civil Case No.
3905), because the former was for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of
title or for recovery of ownership, whereas the latter case was only for
recovery of possession of the properties and of the fruits that he was not able
to receive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This contention can not </span><span style="">be sustained; it can not be rightly main­tained
that the matter of possession was </span><span style="">not
adjudged in the </span><span style="">earlier
decision, <span class="GramE">nor</span> that the demand for possession of the
properties could not have been raised in Civil Case No. 806.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out </span><span style="">that while it is true that the </span><span style="">decision rendered in said Civil Case No. 806
referred to the action therein as one "for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of one-half of Lots Nos. 570, 572 and 566" and for damages, allegedly
arising from the defendants' refusal to execute the necessary deed of
conveyance in favor of the plaintiff, it is equally a fact that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the same decision provided as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Court renders decision in this case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) declaring the plaintiff and defendants as
<span style="">co-owners of the following parcels of </span>land:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Lot NO. 570 of the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, with <span style="">an area of 4,886 sq. meters covered by T.C.T.
No. 562; </span>(2) northern portion of Lot No. 566 of the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, with an area
of 23,957 <span style="">sq. meters only, covered by
T.C.T. NO. </span><span style="">5159; </span><span style="">and (3) Lot No. 572 of the cadastral survey
of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, with
an area of 41,919 sq. meters covered by the same T.C.T. No. 562, in the
proportion of 1/2 share for the </span>plaintiff and 1/2 for the defendants in
each of said<span style=""> parcel of land; (b)
ordering the plaintiff and defendants to submit to this Court within 15 days
from receipt </span><span style="">of this decision,
an agreement of partition of the parcels </span><span style="">of land abovementioned, in the proportions above stated, or, in case
they disagree, to submit to this Court within </span><span style="">the period of 10 days from the lapse of the period fixed </span><span style="">for the presentation of the agreement, the
names of two disinterested persons to act as Commissioners and to effect said
division in accordance with this judgment, subject to the approval of this
Court, the expenses of division to be borne equally by both parties; (c)
ordering the defendants to execute -within 10 days from the final approval of
the partition - the corresponding deed of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of said 1/2 on each of said parcels of land, in favor of the plaintiff, and in
accordance with said partition, otherwise the Clerk of Court would execute said
deed of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">reconveyance</span></span><span style=""> at the cost of </span><span style="">the defendants according to Section 10, Rule
39 of the Rules of Court; (d) ordering the defendants <u>to </u></span><u>vacate
the specific portion</u><u><span style=""> </span>that
may </u><u><span style="">be finally assigned to the
plaintiff</span></u><span style=""> in said </span><span style="">partit</span><span style="">ion; (e) dismissing the counterclaim; and (f) condemning the defendants
to pay the costs </span>of this suit.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underlining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears, therefore,
that not only is there no necessity for the filing of a separate action to
enable plaintiff-appellant to take possession of the portion that will
appertain to him - for this is already provided for in the decision in Civil
Case No. 806 - but also, that the recognition of appellant's right to
possession would really follow as the logical consequence of the judicial
declaration of his ownership of the properties involved in this
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has said in
another case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">'"The fact that Civil
Case No. 4275, filed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was for recovery of
possession of the lot, whereas Civil </span>Case No. 7801, brought by
appellants was for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> or recovery of
ownership of the same property, does not remove the present proceeding from the
operation of the principle of bar by former judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As specifically stated in the decision in
Civil Case No. 4275, <span style="">now final </span>and
<span class="SpellE">exec<span style="">utory</span></span><span style="">, the right of therein plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein) to possession of the lot was based on a
title issued to the latter in accordance with the Torrens System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the recognition of the
incidental right to possession of the property is predicated upon the court's
recognition of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> right of ownership
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, a </span>change in the form
of action or in the relief sought, does not <span style="">remove a proper case from the application of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>adjudicata</u></span></span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> vs. H. E.
<span class="SpellE">Heacock</span> Co., L-23212, </span>May 18, 1967; Francisco

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, it is
evident from the averments of the complaint quoted earlier in this opinion,
that the basis of appellant's causes of action in Civil Case No. 3905 is his
ownership of an undetermined one-half portion of the three lots, which
ownership was precisely litigated upon in Civil Case NO. 806. Clearly, the
matter of recovery of the fruits accruing to that portion of the property
claimed by appellant, during the period that he was deprived of the possession
thereof, should have been properly pleaded in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And appellant's failure to raise that issue
in Civil Case No. 806, thereby resulting in the non-inclusion of any provision
in the decision rendered therein as to the fruits or rentals that appellant was
not able to receive, abates the ventilation of the same </span>matter in this <span style="">proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rule is well-settled that, as between the parties, a former judgment
would bar the presentation in another action, not only of the matters expressly
adjudged in the first case, but of all </span>matters that could <span style="">have been adjudged in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> et al. vs.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The same reasoning applies
to the sugar quota appertaining to the land, since such quota is in law an
improvement attached to the land itself (Act 4166, sec. 9; Suarez vs. Mt. <span class="SpellE">Aravat</span> Sugar Co., Inc. [96 Phil. 707, 714] <span class="SpellE">Resol</span>. of April 11, 1956; Rodriguez vs. Rodriguez, 101 </span>Phil.
