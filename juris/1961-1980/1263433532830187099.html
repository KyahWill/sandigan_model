(Branch I), entitled Sarmiento Enterprises, Inc. v. Chu Tiong alias Te Liong,
the decision was adverse to the defendant.</p>



<p class="BODY">The execution of the judgment having been returned unsatisfied,
Chu Tiong was examined concerning his income and properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course thereof, he manifested before
the respondent judge his willingness to produce copies of his income tax
returns for the years 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But having been unable to produce said
copies, he wrote a letter addressed to the local Bureau of Internal Revenue,
upon request of the judgment creditor, in the following tenor:</p><p class="BODY"><br></p><div style="text-align: right;">"Care of CFI, Branch I<br>Davao City<br>September 27, 1969<br></div><br><blockquote>The Bureau of Internal

<blockquote>(SGD) CHU TIONG
alias</blockquote>

<blockquote>TE LIONG"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above request includes a release to the above persons of
all the appendices to and other documents supporting all the above income
returns.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(SGD) CHU TIONG alias
TE LIONG"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Twice, the judgment creditor's counsels were refused copies of
said tax returns by the local Bureau of Internal Revenue Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first attempt, though, armed with the
above-quoted letter, they were advised by the local BIR authorities that Chu
Tiong himself should personally be present to request said copies after payment
of the requisite fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second
attempt, pursuant to the advice, they brought Chu Tiong together with his
counsel to the BIR office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Chu
Tiong, then declared that he was compelled to sign said letter of request.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment creditor, then, applied for a subpoena <u>duces
tecum</u> on the strength of said letter, and the same was granted by the court
in an Order dated October 31, 1969, direct­ing the local BIR office to produce
copies of the desired tax returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The local BIR authorities, after consultation with the BIR
Commissioner, moved to quash the subpoena <u>duces</u> <u>tecum</u>, which
however was denied by the respondent judge in his Order dated September 23,
1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration of
the order was also denied by an order dated October 3, 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners who are the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the
Director of Region No. 18 of the BIR, have come to this Court to assail the
validity of the orders of September 23, 1970, and October 3, 1970, issued by
the respondent judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They invoke
provisions of the (old) National Internal Revenue Code and the Regulations
Relating To Inspection of Income Tax Returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provisions relied upon are the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 347.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Unlawful
divulgence of trade secrets</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Except as provided in section 81 any officer or employee of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue who divulges to any person or makes known in any other manner
than may be provided by law information regarding the business, income, or
inheritance of any taxpayer, the secrets, ope­ration, style of work, or
apparatus of any manufacturer or producer, or confidential information
regarding the business of any taxpayer, knowledge of which was acquired by him
in the discharge of his official duties, shall be fined in a sum of not more
than two thousand pesos or imprisoned for a term of not less than six months
nor more than five years, or both." (Tax Code)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 349.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Procuring
unlawful divulgence of trade secrets</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- Any person who causes or procures an officer or employee of the Bureau
of Internal Revenue to divulge any confidential information regarding the
business, income, or inheritance of any taxpayer, knowledge of which was
acquired by him in the discharge of his offi­cial duties, and which it is
unlawful for him to reveal, and any person who publishes or prints in any
manner whatever, not provided by law, any income, profits, losses, or
expenditures appearing in any income tax return shall be fined in a sum of not
more than two thousand pesos or imprisoned for a term of not less than six
months nor more than five years, or both." (Tax Code)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 81.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Disposition
of income tax returns; publication of lists of persons filing returns and
paying taxes</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- After the assessment
shall have been made, as provided in this Title, the returns, together with any
corrections thereof which may have been made by the Commissioner, shall be
filed in the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and shall
constitute public records and be open to inspection as such upon the order of
the <span style="">President of the Philippines under
rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Subject to the approval of the Secretary of Finance, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue may in each year cause to be prepared and
published in any newspaper or made avail­able to public inspection in such
manner as he may determine, lists containing the names and addresses of person
who have filed income tax return and/or paid income taxes." (Tax Code)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Application
for permission to inspect returns</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
Except as hereinafter speci­fically provided, the Collector of Internal Revenue
may, in his discretion upon written application setting forth fully the reasons
for the request, grant permission for the inspection of returns in accordance
with these regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application
will be considered by the Col­lector and a decision reached by him whether the
applicant has met the conditions imposed by these regulations and whether the
reasons advanced for permission to inspect are suffi­cient to permit the
inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such written application is
not required of the officers and employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue
whose official duties require inspection of the return." (Regulations)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Inspection
of returns of individual</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-The
return of an individual shall be open to inspection as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) By the officers
and employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue whose official duties require
such inspection; (b) by the person who made the return, or by his duly
constituted attorney in fact; (c) by the administrator, executor, or trustee of
the taxpayer's estate or by the duly constituted attorney in fact of such
administrator, executor, or trustee, where the maker of the return has died;
and (d) in the discre­tion of the Collector of Internal Revenue, by one of the
heirs of law or next of kin of such deceased <span style="">person upon showing that he has a material interest which will be
affected by the information contained in the return." (Regulations)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The position taken by the
petitioners is based on the letter of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
dated November 17, </span>1969, addressed to the Regional Director of Revenue
Region No. 18 which states in part:</p>

<blockquote>"This refers to your letter dated November 5, 1969, requesting
for a ruling on the following query:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'"May copies of the income tax returns from 1964 to 1968 of
Chu Tiong alias Te Liong be produced in Court in order that the same could be
examined by Sarmiento Enterprises in connection with his income and properties,
based on the letter which he signed, even if the taxpayer vehemently opposed
such production by the Bureau of Internal Revenue?"'</p>

<blockquote>"In reply thereto, please be informed that this Office
approved of the stand taken by your Office that the production of the original
copies of the income tax returns of Chu Tiong for the years 1964 to 1968 is con­trary
to sections 347 and 349 of the Tax Code, as stated in your <u>Motion to Quash
Subpoena Duces Tecum</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
Chu Tiong verbally objected against the furnishing of copies of his income tax
returns for the aforesaid years, in favor of his judgment creditor, the
Sarmiento Enterprises, before internal revenue officers of the Legal Branch of
that Office on October 30, 1969, casts doubt on the validity of the letter of
the taxpayer Chu Tiong dated September 27, 1969, upon which letter a subpoena
duces tecum was issued against the Bureau of Internal Revenue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue then is whether or not, under the factual circumstances
narrated above, the income tax returns of Chu Tiong should be produced by the
Bureau of Internal Revenue before the Court of First Instance of Davao.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, as a rule, the Bureau of Internal Revenue cannot
divulge the income of a taxpayer because of its confi­dential nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the BIR itself has regulations
issued pursuant to the Tax Code indicating the instances when the income of a
taxpayer may be made public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One such
instance is provided in Sec. 4(b) of the Regulations, <u>supra</u>, whereby <span style="">the return of an individual shall be open to
inspection "<u>by the person who made the return, or by his duly
constituted attorney in fact</u>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this case Chu Tiong
not only expressed his willing­ness to produce before the respondent court
copies of his income tax returns for the years 1964 to 1968 but he even wrote
the letter above-quoted asking the BIR to deliver the returns to "Mr.
Alfonso Atilano, Deputy Clerk of Court, CFI, Branch I, or Atty. Leonor T.
Sumcad or Atty. Roberto M. Sarenas" who were then his attorneys-in-fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not true that Chu
Tiong wrote his letter of September 27, 1969, because he was compelled to do
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As narrated by the respondent judge
in his orders dated January 24 and October 3, 1970:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"…1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in the course of the examination of the
judgment debtor-defendant concerning his income and properties in order that
the same may be applied to satisfy the judgment rendered in the above-entitled
case, defendant - impeded, and degraded the administration of justice and the
dignity of this Honorable Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the contemptuous acts of defendant
Chu Tiong which merits his punishment for contempt pursuant to the provisions
of par. (d) sec. 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court consist of the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"'a) During the
course of the examination, Chu Tiong alias Te Liong, testifying under oath,
voluntarily and willingly offered to show to plaintiff copies of his income tax
returns for the year 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968 in order to support his
claim that he had no money or income sufficient to satisfy the judgment
rendered in the above-entitled case (pp. 42, t.s.n., Sept. 9, 1969);</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">"'b) The
succeeding hearings revealed the intention of defendant to delay the proceeding
for examination as he repeatedly failed to produce his income tax returns and
gave diverse reasons for his failure such as his inability to locate them or
his book­keeper whose name sounded like Floren Condia (pp. 64, t.s.n., Sept.
10, 1969), or after locating his bookkeeper, the latter could not find the
income tax returns (pp. 6, 7, t.s.n., Sept. 27, 1969);</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><span style="">'</span>"c) To show defendant Chu
Tiong's clear attempt to thwart and trifle with the proceedings of this
Honorable Court, at the hearing of September 27, 1969, de­fendant Chu Tiong
voluntarily issued an authority for the court commissioner or plaintiff to
secure from the office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue copies of his income
tax returns (p. 32, t.s.n., Sept. 27, 1969) in spite of his counsel's vigo­rous
objection (pp. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30, t.s.n., Sept. 27, 1969).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said authorization was in writing, prepared
and signed by defendant in Court in the presence of the Court Commissioner and
its other personnel as well as defendant's counsel Atty. Regino Unson (p. 32,
t.s.n., Sept. 27, 1969);</p>

<p class="2Q">"'On the bases of the foregoing authorization, herein
plaintiff attempted to secure copies of defendant's income tax returns from the
BIR but each time was unsuccessful as the office of the BIR at First required a
written court order, which was promptly secured by plaintiff on October 18,
1969, and later on, the personal presence of Chu Tiong at the Office of the
BIR.</p>

<p class="2Q">"'On October 30, 1969, Chu Tiong, accompanied by his counsel,
Atty. Regino Unson and Attys. Roberto A. Sarenas and Leonor Sumcad of the
plaintiff, voluntarily went to the office of the BIR with the sole purpose of
securing copies of his income tax returns.</p>

<p class="2Q">"'However, before the legal officer of the BIR, defendant Chu
Tiong, now in the threshold of com­plying with a promised act which he never
really intended to perform, told a lie to the legal officer that he was only
being forced to submit the written authority and does not want his income tax
returns released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This lie of defendant
is borned by the records in the statement of Atty. Perido on the hearing of
November 20, 1969, and in the communication of the BIR to the commissioner
dated November 8, 1969.</p>

<p class="2Q">"'This complete and despicable turn-about made by defendant in
lying that he was forced to sign the written authority resulting in the refusal
of the BIR to release his income tax returns <span style="">is a master stroke of deception designed and perpetuated by him because
he evi­dently has no respect for the law, the courts and its processes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"'The proceeding at hand would not have been unduly prolong
and the interest of justice fully served had defendant not misled the Honorable
Court and plaintiff that he was ready and willing to submit said documents;</p>

<p class="2Q">"'The court requiring of its citizens respect for it, its
processes and proceeding, and an alien, such as defendant Chu Tiong alias Te
Liong, should do no less, if not more;'"</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After hearing, judgment was rendered
on August 31, 1970, in which Chu Tiong was found to have told a lie to the
Regional Office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue when he informed said office
that he was forced to sign the letter of September 27, 1969, and guilty of
contempt of court and sentenced accordingly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, on September 23, 1970, the Court denied the motion of
Atty. Perido<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> to quash the subpoena duces
tecum requiring the production of the income tax returns of Chu Tiong for the
years 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968, mentioned elsewhere in this order,
because of its findings in the contempt proceedings that Chu Tiong alias Te
Liong willingly and voluntarily consented to their production, because of its
findings that Chu Tiong waived his right against the disclosure of said income
tax returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court could have
directed the imprisonment or detention of Chu Tiong until he produced his
income tax returns in the contempt proceedings against him but did not and
instead gave due course to the subpoena duces tecum previously issued by
denying the motion to quash filed by Atty. Perido."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, we are not prepared to rule that the
respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction or committed a grave abuse of discretion
in issuing the questioned orders.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby dismissed and the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent from the well-written opinion of Justice Abad Santos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners question the issuance to the admi­nistrative
officer or "record custodian" of the Revenue Regional Office at Davao
City of a subpoena <u>duces</u> <u>tecum</u> in Civil Case No. 4613,
"Sarmiento Enterprises, Inc. vs. Chu Tiong", for the production in
court of defendant Chu Tiong's income tax returns for the years 1964 to 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">The production of those returns was required in connection with
the examination of Chu Tiong as a judgment debtor since the execution of the
judgment against him in that case was returned unsatisfied (Sec. 38, Rule 39,
Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Chu Tiong at first expressed willingness during the hearing and
even in writing to produce his income tax returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He authorized the Revenue Regional Director
to deliver copies of his income tax returns to the deputy clerk of court or to
the lawyers of the judgment creditor.</p>

<p class="BODY">But when he was required personally to appear in the Revenue
Regional Office to confirm that he authorized the production of his income tax
returns, he changed his mind, presumably upon the advice of his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He refused to allow the issuance of certified
copies of his income tax returns for production in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the lower court had to issue the subpoena <u>duces</u> <u>tecum</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It denied the motion of the revenue lawyer to
quash the subpoena.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subpoena was assailed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
in the instant <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No restraining order or preliminary
injunction was issued herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
does not show whether this case has become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are whether Chu Tiong's income tax returns can be used
against him over his objection and whether the Bureau of Internal Revenue can
be compelled to produce the said returns in the execution proceeding in the
said civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am of the opinion that the subpoena <u>duces</u> <u>tecum</u>
was erroneously issued because the production of Chu Tiong’s income tax returns
is not warranted under Revenue Regula­tions No. 33, relating to the inspection
of income tax returns, which were promulgated by the Secretary of Finance and
approved by the Governor-General on October 13, 1922, 21 O.G. 1246 and which
are still in force and are good under section 81 of the National Internal
Revenue Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4 of Regulations No. 33 allows the individual taxpayer or
his duly constituted attorney-in-fact to inspect his return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 cannot be invoked in this case
because Chu Tiong had changed his mind and was no longer willing to allow the
inspection in court of his income tax returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The production in court of income tax returns is governed by
section 11 of Regulations No. 33.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
provides that the original income tax return may be furnished by the
Commissioner of internal Revenue "for use as evidence in litigation in any
court, where the Government" "is in­terested in the result, or for
use in the preparation for such litigation, to provincial or city fiscal or any
attorney connected with the Bureau of Justice designated to handle such
matters, upon written request of the Solicitor General, or an assistant
attorney acting on his behalf".</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11 further provides that "neither the original nor a
copy of an income tax return, desired for use in litigation in court where the
Government" "is not interested in the result and where such use might
result in making public the information contained therein, will be furnished,
except as" provided in section 12 of Regulations No. 33, which refers to
the furnishing of copies of the income tax returns to the taxpayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(As to text of Regulations No. 33, see 1
Dalupan, Tax Code Annotated, 1946, pp. 424-430.)</p>

<p class="BODY">An example of a case where the income tax returns may be produced
in court upon the request of the Solicitor General is a criminal case for
estafa through falsification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution may require the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his
representative to produce in court the income tax returns of the accused since
the Government is interested in the result of the said case (Cu Unjieng vs.
Posadas, 58 Phil. 360).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, a litigant may not be compelled through subpoena <u>duces</u>
<u>tecum</u> to produce the original income tax returns filed by him in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may not
be compelled to ask the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for said originals
(Sarayba de Arnaldo vs. Locsin, 69 Phil. 113, 119).</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused in a criminal case does not have the unqualified
right to ask for the issuance of a subpoena <u>duces</u> <u>tecum</u> for the
production in court of the income tax returns of certain persons (People vs.
Topacio and Santiago, 59 Phil. 356, 367).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the production in court of Chu Tiong's income Tax returns
is not authorized under Regulations No. 33, I vote for the quashing of the
subpoena <u>duces</u> <u>tecum</u> and the granting of the writs of <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition.</p>
