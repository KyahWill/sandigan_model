decision of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing the 
plaintiff-appellant's complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> 
under Civil Case No. 3963. <o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On </span><st1:date month="5" day="2" year="1956"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">May 2, 
1956</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, 
<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span> filed with 
the Municipal Court of Iloilo an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, with prayer for damages, against the 
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein, <span class="SpellE">Biblano</span> <span class="SpellE">Laygo</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Natal. After 
trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The above-named 
defendants were ordered to vacate the premises in question and to pay for the 
use and occupation of the same. On appeal to the Court of First Instance of 
Iloilo, the above decision was reversed, against which reversal the plaintiff 
perfected an appeal. In the Notice of Appeal, the plaintiff stated that he was 
appealing to the Supreme Court. However, somehow, the records of this case were 
transmitted to the Court of Appeals. This latter court, on noting the above, 
certified the case to this Court which accepted it under its resolution of 
</span><st1:date month="6" day="28" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">June 28, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The land in dispute refers to a 
2,286 square meter lot situated in the District of <span class="SpellE">Manduriao</span>, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Iloilo</span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It is registered with the 
Iloilo Registry under the names of Jose and Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>, brother and sister and both deceased, for 2/5 
and 3/5 shares respectively, as Lot No. 2575 of the Cadastral Survey of Iloilo. 
Until the filing of the case at bar with the Municipal Court of Iloilo, the 
respective shares of the above co-owners were still <span class="SpellE">unsegregated</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On June 15, 1955, the heirs of 
Jose <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>, namely: <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span>, Leticia and Josefina, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>, conveyed in absolute sale to the 
plaintiff-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, the latter's 2/5 share therein, A day later, or on 
June 16, 1955, the same children of Jose <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>, 
but this time in their capacity as devisees and legatees of their aunt, Asuncion 
<span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>, entered into a "contract to sell" 
Asuncion's share in the <span class="GramE">abovementioned</span> lot with the 
same plaintiff-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>, on condition that, among others, the latter would 
advance the expenses necessary for the probate of the will of Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>. On September 15, 1955, <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> wrote a 
letter to the plaintiff-appellant to advise him of the rescission of the above 
contract to sell in view of the latter's failure to pay "for all the expenses " 
incurred in the proceedings over Asuncion's will. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It turned out that on February 6, 
1951, however, the heirs of Jose <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>, thru 
their attorney-in-fact, Jose Mesa, had leased to the herein defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> the latter's 2/5 share in the aforementioned lot. 
Only the agreement with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span>, though, was reduced to writing, the other two 
defendants having merely entered into an arrangement with Jose Mesa whereby, for 
P5.00 a month, they were allowed to stay in the premises in question. The 
contract with defendant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span> was for a 
period of three (3) years, renewable for another two. This option was exercised 
so that the lease was extended up to February 6, 1956. On March 23, 1956, 
however, Jose Mesa renewed the said agreement for another three (3) years, or 
until February 6, 1959. This agreement of March 23, 1956, though, is assailed by 
the plaintiff-appellant as null and void on the ground that at the time of its 
execution, the leased property had already been sold to the appellant and Jose 
Mesa, therefore, had no longer any authority to convey or encumber the same. In 
the original as well as in the renewed contracts, the parties expressly agreed 
that the leased portion would be used to put up a gasoline station. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On August 9, 1955, the plaintiff 
wrote a letter to the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span>, requesting that the latter's rental for the 
property occupied by him under the lease contract mentioned above be paid to him 
or his lawyer inasmuch as he had bought the said property from the said 
defendant's <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>. On August 22, 1955, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span> rejected the above request on the ground that he 
never had any agreement, verbal or written, with the plaintiff. There are no 
records of similar correspondences between the plaintiff and the other 
defendants, <span class="SpellE">Bibiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Laygo</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Natal. Subsequently, however, all three 
defendants were served letters of demand to vacate the premises in question by 
the plaintiff and when the said defendants refused to do so, the plaintiff 
initiated the case at bar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In dismissing the complaint, the 
trial court held: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"There is no dispute that the 
plaintiff is the owner of 2/5 undivided portion of lot 2575 of the cadastral 
survey of Iloilo. But with respect to the 3/5 portion of said lot, the plaintiff 
cannot claim absolute ownership of same for the reason that the contract to sell 
is not a final deed of sale which gives rise to the claim of absolute ownership 
of the land by the plaintiff. In Special Proceeding No. 1163, the ownership of 
the 3/5 portion of said lot 2575 is still under litigation between the heirs of 
<span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> on 
one hand and <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> and his two sisters on the other. The case is 
still pending before the Court. The conditional contract to sell is predicated 
on the final probate of the will of deceased Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>. If the will is not probated, <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> and his two 
sisters cannot execute a final deed of sale in favor of the plaintiff. On top of 
this predicament is the move of <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> in withdrawing the promise to sell the 3/5 
portions of the land to the plaintiff. (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 11). This 
makes the claim of ownership of the plaintiff precarious indeed. It should be 
borne in mind that the 2/5 portion belonging to the plaintiff is not as yet 
segregated and we cannot say that the gasoline station of the defendant is built 
exactly on said 2/5 portion belonging to the plaintiff. It being shown that the 
plaintiff has no absolute and definite claim of ownership of over 3/5 portion of 
the land; there being no positive proof that the gasoline station of the 
defendant is built in the 2/5 portion belonging to the plaintiff; the defendant 
had been paying the rentals due in accordance with the contract of lease which 
is due to expire in 1959 this action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> is premature. The plaintiff may contend that the 
contract of lease was not duly registered in the office of the Register of Deeds 
and there it has no effect on him, but the fact that the gasoline station 
existed long before the deed of promise to sell was executed is a more effective 
and concrete notice to the plaintiff of the existence of the lease rights of the 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span>. Besides, the original lease 
provides that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> shall make a reservation in 
the deed of sale that the purchaser shall be bound to respect the lease." 
<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find for the 
plaintiff-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To begin with, the portion of the 
property leased by the heirs of Jose <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> to the 
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and from which the latter are 
sought to be ejected is the very same 2/5 portion sold in absolute sale by the 
said heirs to the plaintiff-appellant. Consequently, it is entirely immaterial 
that it is <span class="SpellE">unsegregated</span> from the totality of the whole 
parcel and that the ownership over the remaining 3/5 portion is unsettled since 
the said defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' right to stay in the 
premises in question is confined and limited to the 2/5 portion pertaining to 
the plaintiff-appellant. Wherever else in the entire lot might the said 2/5 
portion be ultimately designated, there and there only could the 
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have constructed the gasoline 
station mentioned in the lease contract. Thus, and contrary to the lower court's 
ruling, there need be "no positive proof that the gasoline station of the 
defendant is built in the 2/5 portion belonging to the plaintiff." That gasoline 
station could not have lawfully been constructed elsewhere. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To be sure, it will not matter 
the least who eventually owns and where the remaining 3/5 of the lot in question 
is finally located. It is not, after all, involved in any way in the only 
defense asserted by defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>: namely, the 
existence of a lease agreement over the 2/5 portion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Then, too, upon the purchase of a 
leased property, and proper notice by the vendee to the lessee, the latter must 
pay the agreed rental to the new owner (De Jesus v. <span class="SpellE">Sociedad</span>, 23 Phil. 76) since the sale places the vendee into 
the shoes of the original <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to whom the lessee 
bound himself to pay. When, therefore, notwithstanding such notice the herein 
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> refused to pay their respective rentals to 
the plaintiff-appellant, the new owner, the latter became entitled to evict the 
lessees from the premises and to recover from them the unpaid rent thereon. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In connection with the 
abovementioned notice given by the plaintiff-appellant to the herein 
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, it may be mentioned that the 
said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had absolutely no ground to disbelieve 
or even doubt the truth of the plaintiff's claim of ownership over the leased 
property nor his right to the rentals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>. While 
the said notice was signed by the plaintiff's counsel, Atty. Leon P. <span class="SpellE">Gellada</span>, it also had, below the letter, the following note: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>.) 
BERNABE MIRASOL<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">With our conformity 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>.) 
DESIDERIO MIRAFLORES <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;" align="right"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">(for himself and for Leticia and 
Josefina, surnamed <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span>)"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Finally, we find merit in the 
plaintiff-appellant's contention that the agreement of March 23, 1956 between 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span> and Jose Mesa, the <span class="SpellE">Mirafloreses</span>' attorney- in- fact, extending the lease period 
up to 1959, was null and void. It should be recalled that the sale in favor of 
the plaintiff-appellant of the very same property involved in the above lease 
agreement took place on June 15, 1955. Notice of this sale was given to the 
defendants sometime in August, 1955. Therefore, on March 23, 1956, Jose Mesa no 
longer had any authority to contract for the said property since he was merely 
the attorney-in-fact of the <span class="SpellE">Mirafloreses</span> who, by then, 
were no longer the owners of the same. All these, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span> had actual notice of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We hold, therefore, that the 
plaintiff-appellant's notice to the herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
sometime in August 1955 that he had bought the leased property and that, 
therefore, the rentals on it should be delivered to him, obliged the said <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, as lessees to comply with the demand. When they 
failed to do so, the plaintiff-appellant acquired the right to evict them from 
the premises and to recover from them the unpaid rent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The increase in rent demanded by 
the plaintiff-appellant from the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span> should begin to run only from February 
6, 1956, when the original lease contract, as extended pursuant to the option 
therein granted to the lessee, expired. Prior to this date, the rent should be 
computed at the rate stipulated in the said original contract. For the 
defendants <span class="SpellE">Bibiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Laygo</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Crisanta</span> Natal, the rent of P10.00 a month, as 
demanded by the plaintiff-appellant in his letters to them of April 14, 1956, 
may be allowed to start from the date their receipt thereof considering that 
they had no formal contract with the heirs of Jose <span class="SpellE">Miraflores</span> and that their informal arrangement with Jose 
Mesa, the said heir's attorney-in-fact, was on a month to month basis. (Art. 
1687, Civil Code)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">WHEREFORE</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, the decision appealed from is 
hereby reversed. The defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are directed 
to vacate the premises in question and to pay the herein appellant the amounts 
above-specified up to and until the said appellant shall have actually recovered 
from them the possession of the said property, plus legal interest from the 
filing of the complaint and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">I concur on the basis that the

where the gasoline station was later erected by the lessee <span class="SpellE">Magsuci</span>, the latter is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> 
to contend that his <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> share was anywhere else 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">For the same reason, the other

<p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is elementary that a lessee

as of the time the lease was entered into.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div>
