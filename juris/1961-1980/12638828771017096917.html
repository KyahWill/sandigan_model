<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1966</st1:date>,
the herein respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> Tan, Sr.
(hereinafter referred to as "Judge Tan") filed with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
a petition for the probate of the aforesaid will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 21, Judge Tan was appointed as
executor of the testate estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>
without a bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="6">June
 3, 1966</st1:date>, Judge Tan informed the Commissioner that the testate
estate was worth about ten million (P10 million) pesos and that the estate and
inheritance taxes due thereon were about P9.5 million.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 11, 1966, the herein respondent Atty. Delia P. Medina
(hereinafter referred to as "Atty. Medina"), representing herself as
the attorney-in-fact of the herein respondents <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>,
filed with the probate court a motion praying that the executor of the estate
be authorized to give a monthly allowance to the voluntary heirs <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> from the month
of May, 1966 until "the receipt of the recom­mended advance of inheritance
of P100,000.00 each recommended by the Executor in his motion of June 6, 1966
and/or final distribution has been made to said heirs of their respective
shares in the estate." This prayer was granted by the probate court in an
order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1966</st1:date>
(subsequently clarified in an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1966</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1966</st1:date>,
the Commissioner filed with the probate court a proof of claim for the sum
"of P192,364.00 as income tax for 1965 and 1% monthly interest due from
the deceased Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1966, Judge Tan filed with the probate court a motion
praying for authority to make the following additional advance payments -- ­(1)
To <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>,
P150,000.00; (2) To Bess Lauer, $75,000.00; (3) To Judge Tan as advance
executor's fees, P50,000.00; and (4) To Attys. Medina and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
Tan, Jr., P75,000.00 each as advance attorney's fees. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In this motion, Judge Tan claimed that the
estate was very liquid and that "any claims whatsoever against the Estate
and the Government shall be amply protected since over P7,000,000.00 worth of
shares shall still remain to answer <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> (Sec. 1,
Rule 90, Rules of Court)." The respondent Judge granted Judge Tan's prayer
in an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter, dated November 4, 1966, the Commissioner advised
Judge Tan to pay to the Bureau of Internal Revenue the sum of P1,398,436.30 as
estate tax and P7,140,060.69 as inheritance tax, the investigation of his
office having allegedly disclosed that the net value of the testate estate was
P10,212,899.20.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Judge Tan disputed the correctness of the assessment in a letter sent to the
Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1966</st1:date>,
the Commissioner filed with the probate court a proof of claim for the death
taxes stated in the assessment notice sent to Judge Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, the Commissioner also
submitted to the probate court for its resolu­tion a motion praying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) for the revocation of the court's orders
dated June 25, July 6, July 23 and August 11, 1966 and all other orders
granting the payment of advance inheritance, allowances and fees; (2) for the
appointment of a co-administrator of the estate to represent the Government;
and (3) for the non-disbursement of funds of the estate without prior notice to
the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the records
do not disclose that the probate court specifically disposed of this motion, the
said court, from its subsequent actuations, may be considered to have impliedly
denied the Commissioner's prayers for the appointment of a co-administrator and
the non-payment of advance allowances and fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1967</st1:date>,
the probate court authorized the conversion of the amount of P75,000.00
previously ruled to be paid to Atty. Medina as advance attorney's fees in its
order of <st1:date year="1966" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1966</st1:date> into
allowances for <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1967</st1:date>,
with the probate court's approval, Judge Tan paid to the Bureau of Internal
Revenue the amount of P185,286.93 as estate tax and, on <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1967</st1:date>, the amount of P1,055,776.00 as
inheritance tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These payments were
based on a tax return filed by Atty. Medina on <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date> with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1967</st1:date>,
Judge Tan submitted to the probate court for approval a final accounting and
project of partition of the testate estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting thereon, the respondent Judge issued an order, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1967</st1:date>, for the partial
distribution of the estate as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Submitted for resolution of this Court is the Amended Final
Accounting and Project of Partition dated <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1967</st1:date>, presented by the executor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> manifested that he
has no objection to the approval thereof provided that certain items enumerated
therein be corrected or modified, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the amount of shares in the <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
Consolidated Mining Co. should be 6,105,429 instead of 6,015,429, as reported;
the amount of P11,537.60 reported as expenses made on January 30, 1967 should
be cancelled or excluded ... and that the item appearing as expenses made on
May 10, 1967 payable to <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Villegas should be
only P114,000.00 instead of P135,000.00 ... which manifestations were also
adopted by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saldajeno</span>
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and in addition, he objected in principle to
the Executor Fees and to the Attorney's Fees as excessive but left the matter
to the discretion of the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering, further, the mani­festations of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Saldajeno</span> that he has no objection to the partial
distribution of the estate as long as it can be shown that the rights and
interests of the government can be fully protected, and it appearing from the
subsequent manifestation of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, counsel
for the heirs, a that sufficient assets with a current market value of at least
P8,000,000.00 will be left to the estate even if a partial distribution in the
amount of P3,000,000.00 is made, for which reason the rights of the government
to collect whatever deficiency taxes, if any, may be assessed in the future the
heirs have already paid in good faith even ahead of its due dates transfer
taxes in the total amount of P1,241,062.93, the Amended Final Accounting and
Project of Partition dated May 27, 1967 may be approved, subject to the
following terms and conditions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Executor is hereby dis­charged from any
and all responsibi­lities that he has pertaining to the estate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voluntary heirs Magda­lena <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> shall be responsible for all taxes of any nature
whatsoever which may be due the government arising out of the transaction of
the properties of the estate, and the government can, if it so desires,
register its tax lien on the remaining assets after a partial distribution of
the estate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bess Lauer, sister and heir of the deceased
shall be fully res­ponsible for all <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> taxes pertaining to her share in the
estate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, subject to the above terms and conditions, Amended
Final Accounting and Project of Partition dated <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1967</st1:date> submitted by the Executor, as modified in the
mani­festation of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saldajeno</span>, is hereby approved.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same day (that is, June 5, 1967), the Commissioner, having
been informed in advance about the foregoing order by certain undisclosed
sources, issued warrants of garnishment against the funds of the estate
deposited with the Philippine National Bank, the Overseas Bank of Manila, and
the Philip­pine Banking Corporation, on the strength of sections 315-330 of the
National Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 7, 1967, Atty. Medina filed in the probate court a
petition for the discharge of the writs of garnishment issued by the
Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 8, 1967, the
respondent Judge issued an order lifting the writs in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 9, 1967, the Philippine National Bank filed a motion in the
probate court praying that it be authorized to deposit with the said court the
money in its hands in view of the conflicting claims of the parties over the
funds in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same day (that
is, June 9, 1967), the respondent Judge issued an order denying the said motion
and threatening the bank officials who refuse to implement its orders of June 5
and 8, 1967 with contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Medina
was consequently able to withdraw the sum of P2,330,000.00 from the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of this order of June 9, 1967 as well
as the orders of June 5 and 8, 1967 were received by the Commissioner on June
13, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 16, 1967, the Commissioner filed a motion for
reconsideration (supplemented on June 22, 1967) of the orders of the probate
court dated June 5, 8 and 9, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
July 6, 1967, however, the Commissioner, on the belief that the probate court's
resolution on its motion was not legally necessary, filed with this Court the
instant petition for <i>certiorari, mandamus</i>, prohibition and injunction
against the aforesaid orders of the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition at bar is based on the following
propositions:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the distributive shares of an heir can
only be paid after full payment of the death taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this case subsequently progressed before
this Court, the position of the Commissioner would seem to be that the
deficiency income taxes due and payable during the lifetime of the deceased
should also be paid first.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While partial distribution of the estate of a
deceased may be allowed, a bond must be filed by the <span class="SpellE">distributees</span>
to secure the payment of the transfer taxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, however, the Commis­sioner changed his position, stating
that such distribution may be made so long as the payment of the taxes due the
government is "provided for," citing section 1, Rule 90 of the Rules
of Court in relation to sections 95(c), 97, 103, 106 and 107(c) of the National
Internal Revenue Code.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the executor of an estate cannot be dis­charged
without the payment of estate and inheritance taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner later modified his stand on
this proposition in line with the view that it is sufficient if the payment of
the said taxes is "provided for."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the delivery of properties of the estate
to a stranger [that is, to the voluntary heirs herein] is not sanctioned by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, as the case at bar
progressed, and in view of a compromise offer made by the respondents <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> to pay the
taxes being claimed by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner
advanced the view that this proposition is already moot and academic.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent Judge has no authority to
quash or dissolve writs of garnishment issued by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however, the Commissioner
reversed his stand on this point and stated that the probate court may so
dissolve said writs of garnishment as the assets in question were then in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></u>,
citing Collector vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Codiñera</span>,
L-9675, Sept. 28, 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking stock of the Commissioner's complaint that the disputed
orders were issued without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
dis­cretion, the herein respondents Atty. Medina and Judge Tan put up a number
of factual and legal arguments, the material ones of which may be stated, in
sum, as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner's notice of assessment, dated
November 10, 1966, was based on wrong premises and valuation of the assets in
question; in fact, the Commissioner had agreed during the pre-trial conference
in the probate court to reconsider certain items therein;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allowance granted to <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> were taken solely from the income of the
estate, a fact admitted by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Saldajeno</span> of the
Bureau of Internal Revenues it is claimed that in 1965 the estate had an income
of P411,000.00 and over P750,000.00 in 1966, which could more than cover the
questioned allowances;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> are willing and bound themselves to assume the
responsibility for the payment of the taxes due against the estate except for
the properties located in the United States which should be charged against
Bess Lauer;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner does not object to the
partition of the estate in question provided that enough assets are left to pay
the taxes against the estate;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The estate has sufficient assets with which to
pay the taxes being claimed by the government;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing unusual in the insti­tution
of <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> as
residual heirs of the deceased; <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> was the
testator's special nurse, companion, secretary and cook from 1945 until Elsie
M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>' death in March, 1966; <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>,
on the other hand, was the deceased's cook, caretaker, companion and driver
since 1929;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(7)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grant of allowances was never contested
below and cannot now be raised in the instant proceedings;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(8)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adequate safeguards were specified in the
probate court's order of June 5, 1967 to cover the tax claims; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(9)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There had been no full distribution of the
estate in question without payment of the transfer taxes since the said taxes
are being dis­puted by the heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a reply filed on September 7, 1967, the Commissioner stated
that he had issued a revised assessment dated August 24, 1967 and that, further­more,
there were due from the estate deficiency income taxes for the years 1961 to
1965 in the total sum of P1,182,296.16, for which reason the estate should not
be ordered distributed until the same is fully satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a rejoinder, Judge Tan claimed that the
August 24, 1967 assessment could still be reduced considerably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contents of the mentioned revised
assessment which was addressed to Atty. Medina are, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Madam:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> I

gross estate of P9,341,734.81.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

payable, respectively, or a total of P1,882,198.74, were allowed as deductions

rendered by various persons in the total sum of P366,800.00, foregoing thereby
other possible objections to the other items just so this case can be earlier

these due dates the entire amount specified in said assessment, but under

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">To pay the taxes in question, Atty.
Medina prayed in her offer of compromise that she and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> be authorized to make use of the funds of
the estate on deposit with the Philippine National Bank (P238,500.00), the
Philippine Banking Corporation (P559,147.41), the <span class="SpellE">Banco</span>
Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank (P581.00), and the Overseas Bank of Manila
(P700,000.00), and to gradually dispose of and sell the shares of stock
representing investments in several corporations of the estate with an<span style="">&nbsp; </span>estimated market value of P2,154,026.36.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also included among the assets for which
authority to sell was being procured in the said offer of compromise were
2,442,000 <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining Co. shares
which <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>
deposited with the probate court after this Court issued a preliminary injunc­tion
in the case at bar on July 10, 1967 ordering, among others, Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> to restore to
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> the amount of P2,330,000.00 withdrawn from the
Philippine National Bank pursuant to the questioned orders of the probate
court, and every other money or property received by them by virtue of said
questioned orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mentioned <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> shares had then an estimated market value of
P2,588,520.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should bear mention,
at this point, that the money withdrawn from the Philippine National Bank was
not returned by Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> or <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> to the probate court, these respondents having
prayed this Court that the deposit of the mentioned stocks be considered as
full compliance by them with the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this
Court. </p>

<p class="BODY">On November 17, 1967, this Court authorized the herein
respondents <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>
and Atty. Medina to withdraw funds of the estate deposited with the Philip­pine
Banking Corporation (P191,673.68) and the Overseas Bank of Manila (P700,000.00)
in the form of cashier's checks payable to the Commissioner for the payment of
the estate tax still unpaid under the terms of the revised assessment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 23, 1967, the Solicitor General filed with this Court
a manifestation expressing his conformity, in behalf of the Commissioner, to
the offer of compromise dated September 9, 1967 made by Atty. Medina, subject
to certain conditions, such as, that the cash in the banks of the estate as
well as the proceeds to be realized from the sale of the shares of stock should
be turned over to the Commissioner for the payment of the taxes due against the
estate and the heirs thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
manifestation was first opposed by the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue
on the ground that the Commissioner (who was then abroad) had actually
requested the Solicitor General not to agree to the mentioned offer of
compromise; however, the Solicitor General subsequently said that the
Commissioner's conformity was given to him orally.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1967</st1:date>,
Atty. Medina filed with this Court a petition to declare the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in contempt for allowing the renewal, with­out court authority, of the time deposit
of P700,000.00 with the said bank for another year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a supplemental motion filed on December 8,
1967, Atty. Medina also prayed that the said bank and those responsible for
extending the maturity date of said time deposit be held liable for the payment
of whatever surcharges, interest and penalties may be imposed as a consequence
of the late payment of the balance of the estate tax assessed against the
estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the time deposit
in question was held by the said bank under two certificates, one for
P100,000.00 to mature on <st1:date year="1967" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1967</st1:date>,
and the other, for P600,000.00 to mature on <st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge Tan, however, extended the maturity date of said time deposits to <st1:date year="1968" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certificates of time deposit covering the
said funds had been endorsed in favor of the Commis­sioner in payment of the
unpaid balance of the estate which then (December 7, 1967) amounted to
P700,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner, however,
informed the respondents <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> through their counsel that his Office -?</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> regrets that the same cannot be accepted as payment of
the defi­ciency estate tax in this case since they cannot, at present or on or
before December 9, 1967, be con­verted into cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we are holding said certificates of
time deposit for possible application in payment of the unpaid balance of the
deficiency estate tax in this case as soon as said certification can be the
balance of the deficiency estate tax in this case is not paid on or before
December 9, 1967, the same shall be subject to the interest on deficiency, 5%
sur­charge and 1% monthly interest for delinquency."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">According to Judge Tan, he caused the
extension of the maturity date of the said deposit but that in doing so he acted
in good faith in that the testate estate then had ample funds and assets and
the said time deposit earned a higher interest than a savings deposit; that he
needed no specific court authority for the purpose; and that he had a
gentleman's agree­ment with the officials of the bank that said deposit could
be withdrawn in advance, such being the custom in banking circles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
on the other hand, in answer to Atty. Medina's mentioned petition, claimed that
the deposit in question was renewed before the bank received any letter
demanding its release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this
impasse and the fast approaching deadline for the payment of the estate tax,
Atty. Medina requested the Commissioner to credit P700,000.00 to the amount
previously paid as inheritance tax; but, apparently, this request was not
honored by the Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 26, 1968, Atty. Medina filed with this Court a
manifestation in which she alleged that even as the proposed joint
manifestation between the parties which was supposed to describe the matters
agreed upon between them and the Commissioner during a conference hearing held
on January 24, 1968 had not yet been shown to her, she already wished to
express her principals' conformity to pay, but under protest, the deficiency
estate tax of P700,000.00 plus sur­charges, interest and penalties due thereon
and the inheritance tax in the amount of P4,161,986.12 appearing, according to
Atty. Medina, in the mentioned assessment notice dated August 24, 1967; that
she was likewise agreeable to pay, under protest however, the income taxes for
1961 to 1965 assessed against the estate in the demand letter of the Com­missioner
dated August 29, 1967 in the amount of P1,175,974.51 plus whatever interest,
surcharges and penalties were due thereon; and that she was also agreeable to
being authorized to sell such properties of the estate as may be necessary for
the mentioned purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1968, this Court, acting on the above-mentioned
manifestation of Atty. Medina and the joint manifestation of the parties,
issued a reso­lution authorizing Atty. Medina to pay, albeit, under protest,
the transfer and income taxes collectible from the estate, including the
accompanying delin­quency penalties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. Medina was given the necessary authority to collect and receive

a motion to declare in contempt the <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
Consolidated Mining Co. was filed by Atty. Medina on the ground that the said
corporation refused to turn over to her dividends payable to the testate estate
unless the Commissioner first lifted his garnishment order on said dividends.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1968, this Court issued a resolution suspending
the writs of preliminary injunction issued by this Court on July 10 and 17,
1967 and all warrants of garnishment issued by the Commissioner relative to the
estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>, said suspension to be effective
until such time that Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> shall have fully paid the transfer and income taxes,
including the penalties thereon, covered by existing assess­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Medina thereafter submitted to this
Court performance reports on her activities relative to the authority given
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 9, 1968, Atty. Medina filed with this Court a
manifestation stating that she received a demand letter dated March 7, 1968
from the Commis­sioner for the payment of the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) P756,000.00 as estate tax, including
penalties; (2) P192,186.75 as inheritance tax corresponding to the share of
Bess Lauer; and (3) P451,435.91 as balance of the income tax for the years 1961
to 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Medina claimed the said
demands to be erroneous for the following reasons:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) as to the estate tax, the time deposit in
the Overseas Bank of Manila of P700,000.00 plus interest earned of P60,000.00
as of March 9, 1968 would more than cover the said tax and the certificates of
time deposits were already endorsed to the Commissioner on December 6, 1967;
(2) as to the inheritance tax, she (that is, her principals <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>) was not responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
as the resolution of this Court dated February 6, 1968 required her "to
pay only the estate, inheritance and income taxes, under protest, covered by
existing assessments, against the Estate, and against the heirs Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>;" in a supplemental motion, Atty. Medina
further argued that Bess Lauer alone was solely responsible for the payment of
the inhe­ritance tax on her share and not the decedent's estate in the
Philippines, and that the properties of the testate estate in the United States
of America which consisted of shares of stock and deposits in banks, being
personal properties, were to be excluded from the computation of the gross
estate of the deceased in the Philippines and the computation of the Philippine
estate and inheritance taxes because, under Philippine law, the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of those properties is the place where they are
located, citing Article 16 of the new Civil Code which, she argued, abandoned
the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>mobilia</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">sequuntur</span>
<span class="SpellE">personam</span></u> embodied in Article 10 of the old Civil
Code; and (3) as to the deficiency income tax for 1961-1965, she had paid the
same in the total amount of P1,182,296.16 as of March 9, 1968, which was the
amount stated in the assessment letter of the Commissioner dated August 9,
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Atty. Medina, the
payment of those taxes was made in the following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on February 27, 1968, she paid a total of
P838,518.62 as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the income tax
proper (P715,619,46) in full; interest (P106,855,29) in full; compromise
penalty (P5,000.00) in full; and surcharges P11,052.07) in part only; and, on
March 8, 1968, the amount of P343,773.54 as payment of the remaining
surcharges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, she argued
that the surcharges and interest, if any were still due, could legally accrue
only from <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1967</st1:date>
up to <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1968</st1:date> and
only on the tax proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1968</st1:date>,
a counter-manifestation was filed with this Court by the Commissioner to the
above-mentioned manifestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to the Commissioner, under existing assessments (that is, under the letter of
demand of August 24 and 29, 1967), the estate, inheritance and deficiency
income (1961-1965) taxes due and collectible from the testate estate as of <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1968</st1:date> were as follows:</p>

deficiency income taxes for 1961 to 1965 and the 1% monthly interest for

permit the withdrawal of the time deposit of the testate estate in the said
bank in spite of the fact that the extended maturity date of said deposit had
already expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Medina prayed

of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed with this Court a comment on the urgent manifestation of Atty. Medina
concerning the deposit in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Central Bank, which according to the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
had restrained it from paying its time deposits to the bank's depositors,
averred that this Court's reso­lution of <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1967</st1:date> merely authorized Atty. Medina to
withdraw the deposit from the said bank and did not order the bank to pay the
time deposit in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
according to the Central Bank, the non-payment of the said deposit was not <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> as the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
was in a state of insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A comment
was filed on October 11, 1968 by the Overseas Bank of Manila stating that the

that the time deposit in question was an unrecorded transaction; and that the
Central Bank prohibited the bank to do business due to its distressed financial
condition, for which reason it could not give preference to the payment of the
said deposit as it might prejudice other creditors of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 11, 1968, Atty. Medina filed with this Court a motion

subsequently retracted their statement in the said letter, claim­ing they
signed and sent the same without knowing and understanding its effect and

<p class="BODY">A perusal in depth of the facts of the ins­tant case discloses
quite plainly that the respond­ent Judge committed a grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction in issuing its orders of June 5, 8 and 9,
1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 103 of the National
Internal Revenue Code (hereinafter referred to as "Tax Code")
unequivocally provides that "No judge shall authorize the executor or

The aforesaid orders of the respondent Judge are clearly in diametric
opposition to the mentioned Section 103 of the Tax Code and, consequently, the
same cannot merit approval of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court thus holds that the questioned orders are not in
accordance with statutory requirements, the fundamental question raised herein
regarding the objectionable character of the probate court's mentioned orders
has opened other issues which, not alone their importance to jurisprudence, but
the indispensability of forestalling needless delays when those issues are
raised anew, have, perforce, persuaded this Court that their complete and final
adjudication here and now is properly called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said issues may be specifically framed as
follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the herein respondent heirs be required
to pay first the inheritance tax before the probate court may authorize the
delivery of the hereditary share pertaining to each of them?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are the respondent heirs herein who are
citizens and residents of the Philippines liable for the payment of the
Philippine inheritance tax corresponding to the hereditary share of another
heir who is a citizen and resident of the United States of America, the said
share of the latter consisting of personal (cash deposits and stock shares)
properties located in the mentioned country?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does the assignment of a certificate of time
deposit to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the purpose of paying
thereby the estate tax constitute payment of such tax?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the herein respondent heirs be held
liable for the payment of surcharge and interest on the amount (P700,000.00)
representing the face value of time deposit certificates assigned to the
Commissioner which could not be converted into cash?</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the foregoing, there are also other incidental
questions which are raised in the present recourse, <u>viz.</u>,<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What should be the liability of the
respondents herein on the contempt charges res­pectively lodged against them?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What should be a reasonable fee for the
counsel of the respondents Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> for professional services rendered in con­nection
with the settlement of the estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>?</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the matter of the
authority of a probate court to allow distribution of an estate prior to the
complete liquidation of the inheritance tax, the Tax Code apparently lacks any
provision substantially identical to the mentioned Section 103 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are provisions of the Tax Code, <u>e</u>.<u>g</u>.,
Section 104, which makes it the duty of registers of deeds not to register the
transfer to any new owner of a hereditary estate unless payment of the death
taxes shall be shown; Section 106, which imposes a similar obligation on
business establishments; and Section 107, which penalizes the executor who
delivers to an heir or devisee, and the officers and employees of business esta­blishments
who transfer in their books to any new owner, any property forming part of a
hereditary estate without the payment of the death taxes first being shown; but
those provisions by themselves do not clearly establish that the purpose and
object of the statute is to make the payment of the inheri­tance tax a
pre-condition to an order for the distribution and delivery of the decedent's
estate to the lawful heirs thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cloud of vagueness in the statute, however, is not entirely <span class="SpellE">unbreachable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Rule 90 of the Rules of Court
erases this hiatus in the statute by providing thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>When
order for distribution of residue made.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-- When the debts, funeral charges, and expenses of administration, the
allowance to the widow, and inheritance tax, if any, chargeable to the estate
in accordance with law, have been paid, the court, on the application of the
executor or administrator, or of a person interested in the estate, and after
hearing upon notice, shall assign the residue of the estate to the persons
entitled to the same, naming them and the proportions, or parts, to which each
is entitled, and such persons may demand and recover their respective shares
from the executor or administrator, or any person having the same in his
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there is a controversy
before the court as to who are the lawful heirs of the deceased person or as to
the distributive shares to which each person is entitled under the law, the <span class="SpellE">controvery</span> shall be heard and decided as in ordinary cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No distribution shall be allowed until the payment of the
obligations above mentioned has been made or provided for, unless the <span class="SpellE">distributees</span>, or any of them, give a bond, in a sum to be
fixed by the court, conditioned for the payment of said obligations within such
time as the court directs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Under the provisions of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> Rule, the distribution of a decedent's assets
may only be ordered under any of the following three circums­tances, namely,
(1) when the inheritance tax, among others, is paid; (2) when a sufficient bond
is given to meet the payment of the inheritance tax and all the other
obligations of the nature enumera­ted in the above-cited provision; or (3) when
the payment of the said tax and all the other obligations mentioned in the said
Rule has been provided for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of
these three cases, insofar as the satisfaction of the inheritance tax due from
the estate is concerned, were present when the questioned orders were issued in
the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the res­pondent
Judge did make a condition in its order of June 5, 1967 that the distribution
of the estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span> (except the cash
deposits of than P2 million) shall be <span class="SpellE">trusteed</span> to
Atty. Medina for the payment of whatever taxes may be due to the government
from the estate and the heirs thereto, this Court cannot subscribe to the
proposition that the payment of the tax claims was thereby adequately provided
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the order of
June 5, 1967 was, for all practical intents and purposes, a complete
distribution of the estate to the heirs, for, the executor who is supposed to take
care of the estate was absolutely discharged; the attorney's fees for the
services of a lawyer who presumably acted as legal counsel for the estate in
the court below were ordered paid as were also the fees for the executor's
services; the cash funds of the estate were ordered paid to the heirs; and the
non-cash (real property and shares of stock) properties were likewise ordered
delivered to Atty. Medina whose participation in the said proceedings was in
the capacity of an attorney-in-fact of the herein respondent heirs <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the probate court virtually
withdrew its custodial jurisdiction over the estate which is the subject of
settlement before it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second
place, the respondent Judge, in ordering the distribution of the properties of
the estate in question, relied solely upon the mere manifestation of the
counsel for the heirs <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>
that there were sufficient properties of the estate with which to pay the taxes
due to the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no
evidence on record that would show that the probate court ever made a serious
attempt to determine what the values of the different assets of the estate were
with the view to determining the correctness of the tax claims of the
government and ascertaining that such properties shall be preserved for the
satisfaction of those claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
third place, considering that millions of pesos in taxes were being claimed by
the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the least reasonable thing that the probate
court should have done was to require the heirs to deposit the amount of
inheritance tax being claimed in a suitable institution or to authorize the
sale of non-cash assets under the court's control and supervision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record is likewise bereft of any evidence to show that
sufficient bond has been filed to meet this particular outstanding obligation.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liability of the
herein respondents <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>
to pay the inheritance tax corres­ponding to the share of Bess Lauer in the
inheritance must be negated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inheritance tax is an imposition created by law on the privilege to receive
property.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the scope and subjects of this tax and other related matters in
which it is involved must be traced and sought in the law itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An analysis of our tax statutes supplies no
sufficient indication that the inheritance tax, as a rule, was meant to be the
joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability of the heirs of a
decedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 95(c) of the Tax Code,
in fact, indicates that the general presumption must he otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said subsection reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The inheritance tax imposed by Section 86 shall, in the
absence of contrary disposition by the predecessor, be charged to the account
of each beneficiary, in proportion to the value of the benefit received, and in
accordance with the scale fixed for the class or group to which he
pertains:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That in cases
where the heirs divide <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> the property
left to them by their predecessor or otherwise convey, sell, transfer,
mortgage, or encumber the same without paying the estate or inheritance taxes
within the period prescribed in the preceding subsections (a) and (b), they
shall be <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable for the payment of the
said taxes to the extent of the estate they have received."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent: 0in;">The statute's enumeration of the specific
cases when the heirs may be held <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable
for the payment of the inheritance tax is, in the opinion of this Court, a
clear indication that beyond those cases, the payment of the inheritance tax
should be taken as the individual responsibi­lity, to the extent of the
benefits received, of each heir.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the effect of the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the time deposit certificates to the
Commissioner, the same cannot be held to have extinguished the estate's
liability for the estate tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
first place, in accepting the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> and
delivery of the said certificates, the Commissioner expressly gave notice that
his Office -?</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> regrets that the same can­not be accepted as payment of
the deficiency estate tax in this case since they cannot, at present or on or
before December 9, 1967, be converted into cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we are holding said certificates of
time deposit for possible application in payment of the un­paid balance of the
deficiency estate tax in this case as soon as said certificates can be con­verted
into cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the second place, a time deposit
certificate is a mercantile document and is essentially a promis­sory note.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
By the express terms of Article 1249 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the use of this medium to clear an obligation will "produce the effect of
payment only when they have been cashed, or when through the fault of the
creditor they have been impaired." From the records of the case at bar,
the Commissioner as well as the herein respondents Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> spared no time
trying to collect the value of the said certificates from the Overseas Bank of
Manila but all to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the value of the said certificates (P700,000.00) should
still be considered outstanding.</p>

</div>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br style="page-break-before: always;" clear="all">
</span>

<div class="Section9">

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span> is likewise liable for the payment of the interest
and sur­charges on the said amount of P700,000.00 imposed under Section

<p class="BODY">The interest charge of 1% per month imposed under Section
101(a)(1) of the Tax Code is essentially a compensation to the State for delay

As the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> and delivery of the mentioned time
deposit certificates to the Commissioner did not result in the payment of the
estate tax (for which it was intended), the decedent's estate is consequently
liable for the interest charge imposed in the Tax Code.</p>

surcharge imposed by Section 101(c) of the Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there are cases in this jurisdiction
holding that a surcharge shall not be visited upon a taxpayer whose failure to
pay the tax on time is in good faith,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
this element does not appear to be present in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner, as aforesaid, fully
informed the respondents Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> of the condition to his acceptance of the said time
deposit certificates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner,
in fact, advised them in the same letter that "It will be understood in
this connection that if the balance of the estate tax in this case is not paid
on or before December 9, 1967, the same shall be subject to the interest on
deficiency, 5% surcharge and 1% monthly interest for delinquency."
Moreover, Judge Tan himself, as executor of the estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>, specifically admitted that he was the one who
caused the extension (and consolidation) of the maturity dates of the two time
deposit certificates in question (one for P100,000.00 to mature on May 12, 1967
and the other for P600,000.00 to mature on June 16, 1967) to May 12, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be worthwhile to mention also, in this connection, that
when Atty. Medina applied to this Court for authority to withdraw the amount of
P700,000.00 from the Overseas Bank of Manila on September 9, 1967, the
resolution of this Court dated November 17, 1967, approving her request,
authorized her to withdraw the said amount in the form of cashier's checks
payable to the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
because the Overseas Bank of Manila refused to issue such checks or to allow
her to withdraw said amount in view of the exten­sion of the maturity date of
the deposit in question, Atty. Medina thought that by simply assigning the time
deposit certificates to the Commissioner, she would be deemed to have paid the
estate's obligation in its corresponding amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as aforesaid, the Commissioner was
also unable to convert said amount into cash and he gave notice to that effect
to Atty. Medina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the refusal of
the Overseas Bank of Manila to allow the withdrawal of the said deposit was
then well-known to the parties, it stands to reason that the repre­sentatives
of the estate who stand to be benefited <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
such as the respondents <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>, should have forthwith asked for authority to pay
the same from other funds of the estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. Medina was, in fact, given the authority by this Court to sell
assets of the estate for the payment of the taxes due to the State, but she
never tried to pay the equivalent amount of P700,000.00 in question from the
proceeds of the sales she made afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it will also be noted that the respondents <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case, had in their actual possession at least P2.3 million (the amount
they were able to withdraw from the Philippine National Bank on account of the
questioned orders) which they could have very well used for the payment of the
estate tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, however, opted to put
the same to other uses.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now consider the
several petitions for contempt filed in the case at bar, namely, (a) against
the Philippine National Bank officials for allowing Atty. Medina to withdraw
P2,330,000.00 in contravention of the writ of garnishment issued by the
Commissioner; (b) against the officers of the Overseas Bank of Manila for
allowing the extension of the maturity date of the mentioned time deposit of
P700,000.00 and for refusing to pay the same after the extended term expired;
(c) against Judge Tan who renewed the maturity date of the said time deposits;
(d) against the <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining Co. for
refusing to turn over dividends payable to the estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span> unless the Commis­sioner first lifted his
garnishment order; and (e) against the herein respondents Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> for depositing
shares of stock with the probate court instead of the cash amount of
P2,330,000.00 which they withdrew from the Philippine National Bank on account
of the questioned orders of the probate court, contrary to the resolutions of
this Court dated July 10 and 17, 1967.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contempt charge against the officials of
the Philippine National Bank is without merit, it appearing to the satisfaction
of this Court that they exerted reasonable efforts not to disobey the writ of
garnishment issued by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, said officials merely acted in obedience to the order of the
probate court which threatened them with contempt of court after they moved to
be allowed to deposit with the said probate court the money of the estate of
Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span> deposited with the said bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner himself, through the
Solicitor General, admitted later that its writ of garnish­ment cannot be
superior to that of the probate court's orders as the estate in question was
then in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contempt charges against the officials of
the Overseas Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
likewise merit dis­missal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of the renewal of the term of the time deposits in question, the said extension
was made by no less than the executor of the estate himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The renewal of said term may be considered as
purely an act of administration for the enhance­ment (due to the higher
interest rates) of the value of the estate, and the officials of the bank
cannot consequently be blamed for acting favorably on the executor's
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Tan himself explained
that he did what he did in the honest belief that it would redound to the benefit
of the estate on account of the higher interest rate on time deposits.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to the refusal of the bank's officials to allow
the withdrawal of the time deposit in question after the extended term expired
on May 12, 1968, this Court takes notice of the fact, as stated in our decision
in <u>Ramos vs. Central Bank</u> (L-293250, Oct. 4, 1971; 41 SCRA 565), that as
early as November 20, 1967 the Central Bank required the Overseas Bank of
Manila, in view of its distressed financial condition, to execute a voting
trust agreement in order to bail it out through a change of management and the
promise of fresh funds to replenish the bank's financial port­folio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Overseas Bank of Manila was not able to
normalize its operations in spite of the voting trust agreement -- for, on July
31, 1968, it was excluded by the Central Bank from inter-bank clearing; on
August 1, 1968, its operations were suspended; and on August 13, 1968, it was
com­pletely forbidden by the Central Bank to do business preparatory to its
forcible liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances,
this Court is satisfied with the explanation that to allow Atty. Medina to
withdraw the said time deposits after the extended term would have worked an
undue prejudice to the other depositors and creditors of the bank.</p>

<div class="Section10">

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contempt charge against Judge Tan is also
not meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no sufficient
and convincing evidence to show that he renewed the maturity date of the time
deposits in question maliciously or to the prejudice of the interest of the
estate.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated
Mining Company is likewise entitled to exoneration from the con­tempt charge
lodged against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In refusing to turn
over to Atty. Medina stock dividends payable to the estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>, it is evident that the said corporation acted in good
faith in view of the writ of garnishment issued to it by the Commissioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, on <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1968</st1:date>, this Court passed a resolution
suspending temporarily the warrants of garnishment issued by the Commissioner,
and it does not appear that thereafter the turnover of the stock dividends to
the estate was refused.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With reference to the charge for contempt
against the respondents Atty. Medina, <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>, although admittedly the resolutions of this Court
dated July 10 and 17, 1967 were not strictly complied with by the said
respondents, it appears clearly that they immediately deposited with the
probate court shares of stock with a fairly stable liquidity value of
P2,588,520.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, the main
objective of the instant petition is to assure the State that the assessed tax
obligations shall be paid and, from the records, more than P2 million had
already been paid to the State during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the instant proceedings in this Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With reference to the
attorney's fees to be paid to Atty. Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
this Court is of the opinion, after a careful study of the statement of
services rendered by said counsel to the respond­ents <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Abanto</span> which was submitted to this Court, that
the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) is fair and reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payment of this amount, however, is the
personal liability of the said respondents <span class="SpellE">Eribal</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Abanto</span>, and not that of the estate of Elsie M. <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span>, as the said counsel was hired by the said
respondents to give legal aid to them in connection with the settlement of the
various claims <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> in the probate court and in
this Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court's intended
adjudication of the <u>main</u> <u>issue</u> has been rendered academic by
supervening events which dictate that the Court refrain from issuing any
further order relating thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On July
18, 1977 a "Manifestation and Compliance" was filed by the respondent
Delia P. Medina which states that a compromise payment of P700,000 as
deficiency estate tax, evidenced by an official receipt (annex A of the
Manifestation), was accepted and duly approved by Acting Commissioner of
Internal Revenue <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Plana</span>
(annex B of the same Manifestation), and that "with the said compromise
payment of P700,000, all estate, inheritance and deficiency income taxes ...
including pertinent delinquency penalties thereof have been fully paid and
liquidated, aggregating to P7,929,498.55 ...." No objection thereto was
inter­posed by any of the parties concerned despite due notice thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was further supplemented by a
communication, dated July 19, 1977, of Deputy Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
P. Diaz, informing the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
Metro Manila, that the <span class="SpellE">Gaches</span> estate has already paid
all the estate and inheritance taxes assessed against it, and that,
consequently, the notice of tax lien inscribed on the property and property
rights of the estate can now be consi­dered cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the full settlement of the tax claims,
the requirements of the law have been fully met, and it has become unnecessary
for the Court to issue orders relative to the <u>main</u> <u>issue</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I </span>concur in the
disposition of the incidental issues regarding the payment of Atty. Paredes'
attorney's fees due from respondent Eribal and Abanto's estate and the contempt
charges as set forth in the Court's judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">I reserve my vote as to the Court's "intended
adjudication" of the main issues (Nos. [1] to [4] as discussed in the
Chief Justice's main opinion at pages 25 - 33), since as stated in the main
opinion itself (at page 36) the said issues have been rendered academic with
the full settlement of the Internal Revenue Commissioner's tax <span style="">claims </span>and it has therefore become
unnecessary to advance an opinion there­on or resolve the same.</p>
