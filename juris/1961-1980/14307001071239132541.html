				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Chan Sau Wah, a Chinese citizen born in Fukien, China on January 6, 1932, arrived in the Philippines on November 23, 1961<br>to visit her cousin, Samuel Lee Malaps. She left in mainland China two of her children by a first marriage: Fu Tse Haw and<br>Fu Yan Kai. With her was Fu Yan Fun, her minor son also by the first marriage, born in Hongkong on September 11, 1957.<br><br>Chan Sau Wah and her minor son Fu Yan Fun were permitted entry into the Philippines under a temporary visitor's visa for<br>two (2) months and after they posted a cash bond of P4.000.00.<br><br>On January 24, 1962, Chan Sau Wah married Esteban Morano, a native-born Filipino citizen. Born to this union on<br>September 16, 1962 was Esteban Morano,Jr.<br><br>To prolong their stay in the Philippines, Chan Sau Wah and Fu Yan Fun obtained several extensions. The last extension<br>expired on September 10, 1962.<br><br>In a letter dated August 31, 1962, the Commissioner of Immigration ordered Chan Sau Wah and her son, Fu Yan Fun, to<br>leave the country on or before September 10, 1962 with a warning that upon failure to do so, he will issue a warrant for<br>their arrest and will cause the confiscation of their bond.<br><br>Instead of leaving the country, on September 10, Chan Sau Wah (with her husband Esteban Morano) and Fu Yan Fun<br>petitioned the Court of First Instance oí Manila for mandamus to compel the Commissioner of Immigration to cancel<br>petitioner's Alien Certificates Registration; prohibition to stop the Commissioner from issuing warrants of arrest pending<br>resolution of this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The trial court, on November 3, 1962, issued<br>the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for, upon a P2,000-bond. After trial and the stipulations of facts filed by the parties,<br>the Court of First Instance rendered judgment, viz:<br><br>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote>(a) Granting this petition for Mandamus and Prohibition with respect to petitioner CHAN SAU WAH, who is<br>hereby declared a citizen of the Philippines; ordering the respondent to cancel her Alien Certificate of Registration and other<br>immigration papers, upon the payment of proper dues; and declaring the preliminary injunction with respect to her<br>permanent admission, prohibiting the respondent, his representatives or subordinates from arresting and/or deporting said<br>petitioner;<br><br>(b) Dismissing this petition with respect to petitioner FU YAN FUN, and dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction issued<br>herein, restraining the respondent, his representatives or subordinates from arresting and/or deporting said petitioner;<br><br>(c) Authorizing respondent Commissioner to forfeit the bond filed by herein petitioners CHAN SAU WAH and FU YAN FUN in<br>the amount of P4.000.00; and<br><br>(d) Denying, for lack of merit, the prayer to declare Sec. 37 (a) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 unconstitutional<br>Without pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>Petitioners and respondent Commissioner both appealed.<br><br>We will deal with the claims of both appellants in their proper sequence.<br><br>1. The Solicitor General's brief assails the trial court's declaration that Chan Sau Wah is a citizen of the Philippines. The court<br><i>a quo</i> took the position that "Chan Sau Wah became, by virtue of, and' upon, her marriage to Esteban Morano, a<br>natural-born Filipino, a Filipino ci tizen."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Placed to the fore is paragraph 1, Section 15 of Commonwealth Act 473 [Revised Naturalization Act], which reads:<br><blockquote>'SEC, 15. <i>Effect of the -naturalization on wife and children</i> - Any woman who is now or may<br>hereafter be married to a citizen of the Philippines, and who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen<br>of the Philippines."</blockquote>To apply this provision, two requisites must concur: (a) a valid marriage of an alien woman to a citizen of the Philippines;<br>and (b) the alien woman herself might be lawfully naturalized.<br><br>We may concede that the first requisite has been properly met. The validity of the marriage is presumed.<br><br>But can the same be said of the second requisite? This question by all means is not new. In a series of cases, this court has<br>declared that the marriage of an alien woman to a Filipino citizen does not ipso facto make her a Filipino citizen. She must<br>satisfactorily show that she has all the qualifications and none of the disqualificat: required by the Naturalization Law.<sup<br>STYLE="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"&gt;[3] Ly Giok Ha alias Wy Giok Ha, et al. vs. Emilio Galang, L-21332, March 18,<br>1966, clearly writes down the philosophy behind the rule in the following expressive language, viz:<br><blockquote>"Reflection will reveal why this must be so. The qualifications prescribed under section 2 of the<br>Naturalization Act, and the disqualifications enumerated in its section 4, are not mutually exclusive; and if all that were to be<br>required is that the wife of a Filipino be not disqualified under section 4, the result might well be that citizenship would be<br>conferred upon persons in violation of the policy of the statute. For example, section 4 disqualifies only—<br><br>(c) Polygamists or believers in the practice of polygamy; and<br><br>(d) Persons convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude', so that a blackmailer, or a maintainer of gambling or bawdy<br>houses, not previously convicted by a competent court, would not be there by disqualified; still, it is certain that the law did<br>not intend such a person to be admitted as a citizen in view of the requirement of section 2 that an applicant for citizenship<br>'must be of good moral character'.<br><br>Similarly, the citizen's wife might be a convinced believer in racial supremacy, in government by certain selected classes, in<br>the right to vote exclusively by certain "herrenvolk', and thus disbelieve in the principles underlying the Philippine<br>Constitution; yet she would not be disqualified under section 4, as long as she is not 'opposed to organized government', nor<br>affiliated to groups 'upholding or teaching doctrines opposing all organized governments', nor 'defending or teaching the<br>necessity or propriety of violence, personal assault or assassination for the success or predominance of their ideas'. Et sic de<br>caeteris."</blockquote>Upon the principle of selective citizenship, we cannot afford to depart from the wise precept affirmed and reaffirmed in the<br>cases heretofore noted.<br><br>In the additional stipulation of facts of July 3, 1963, petitioners admit that Chan Sau Wah is not possessed of all the<br>qualifications required by the Naturalization Law.<br><br>Because of all these, we are left under no doubt that petitioner Chan Sau Wah did not become a Filipino citizen.<br><br>2. Squarely put in issue by petitioners is the constitutionality of Section 37 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1940, which reads:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 37. (a) The following aliens shall be arrested upon the I warrant of the Commissioner of<br>Immigration or of any other officer designated by him for the purpose and deported upon the warrant of the Commissioner<br>of Immigration after a determination by the Board of Commissioners of the existence of the ground for deportation as<br>charged against the alien:<br><br>(7) Any alien who remains in the Philippines in violation of any limitation or condition under which he was admitted as a<br>nonimmigrant."</blockquote>Petitioners argue that the legal precept just quoted trenches upon the constitutional mandate in Section 1 (3), Article III [Bill<br>of Right] of the Constitution, to wit:<br><blockquote>"(3) The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable<br>searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon ptrobable cause, to be determined by the<br>judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly<br>describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</blockquote>They say that the Constitution limits to judges the authority to issue warrants of arrest and that the legislative delegation of<br>such power to the Commissioner of Immigration is thus violative of the Bill of Rights.<br><br>Section 1 (3), Article III of the Constitution, we perceive, does not require judicial intervention in the execution of a final<br>order of deportation issued in accordance with law. The constitutional limitation contemplates an order of arrest in the<br>exercise of judicial power<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as a step preliminary or incidental to<br>prosecution or proceedings for a given offense or administrative action, not as a measure indispensable to carry out a valid<br>decision by a competent official, such as a legal order of deportation, issued by the Commissioner of Immigration, in<br>pursuance of a valid legislation.<br><br>The following from American Jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> is illuminating:<br><blockquote>"It is thoroughly established that Congress has power to order the deportation of aliens whose presence in<br>the country it deems hurtful. Owing to the nature of the proceeding, the deportation of an alien who is found in this country<br>in violation of law is not a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. This is so, although the inquiry devolves upon<br>executive officers, and their findings of fact, after a fair though summary hearing, are made conclusive."<br><br><center>* * * * * * *</center><br>"The determination of the propriety of deportation is not a prosecution for, or a conviction of, crime; nor is the deportation a<br>punishment, even though the facts underlying the decision may constitute a crime under local law. The proceeding is in<br>effect simply a refusal by the government to harbor persons whom it does not want. The coincidence of local penal law with<br>the policy of congress is purely accidental, and, though supported by the same facts, a criminal prosecution and a<br>proceeding for deportation are separate and independent."</blockquote>In consequence, the constitutional guarantee set forth. in Section 1(3), Article III of the Constitution aforesaid requiring that<br>the issue of probable cause be determined by a judge, does not extend to deportation proceedings.<sup style="">[6]</sup><br><br>In view, we, here express finds support in the discussions during the constitutional convention. The convention recognized,<br>as sanctioned by due process, possibilities and cases of deprivation of liberty, other than by order of a competent court.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the power to deport or expel aliens is an attribute of sovereignty. Such power is planted on the "accepted maxim of<br>international law, that every sovereign nation has the power, as inherent in sovereignty, and essential to self-preservation, to<br>forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> So it is, that<br>this Court once aptly remarked that there can be no controversy on the fact that where aliens are admitted as temporary<br>visitors, "the law is to the effect that temporary visitors who do not depart upon the expiration of the period of stay granted<br>them are subject to deportation by the Commissioner of Immigration, for having violated the limitation or condition under<br>which they were admitted as nonimmigrants (Immigration Law, Sec. 37 (a) t subsection (7) C.A. 613, as amended)"<sup<br>STYLE="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"&gt;[9]<br><br>And, in a case directly in point, where the power of the Commissioner to issue warrants of arrest was challenged as<i><br>unconstitutional</i> because "such power is only vested in a judge by Section 1, paragraph 3, Article III of our<br>Constitution", this Court declared—<br><blockquote>"This argument overlooks the fact that the stay of appellant Ng Hua To as temporary visitor is subject to<br>certain contractual stipulations as contained in the cash bond put up by him, among them, that in case of breach the<br>Commissioner may require the recommitment of the person in whose favor the bond has been filed. The Commissioner did<br>nothing but to enforce such condition. Such a step is necessary to enable the Commissioner to prepare the ground for his<br>deportation under section 37 (a) of Commonwealth Act 613. A contrary interpretation would render such power nugatory to<br>the detriment of the State."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>It is in this context that we rule that Section 37 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1940 is not constitutionally proscribed.<br><br>3. A sequel to the question just discussed is the second error set forth in the government's brief. The Solicitor General balks<br>at the lower court's ruling that petitioner Chan Sau Wah is entitled to permanent residence in the Philippines without first<br>complying with the requirements of Sections 9 and 13 of the Immigration Act of 1940, as amended by Republic Act 503.<br><br>We first go to the law, viz:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 9 [last paragraph]<br><br>An alien who is admitted as a nonimmigrant cannot remain in the Philippines permanently. To obtain permanent admission,<br>a nonimmigrant alien must depart voluntarily to some foreign country and procure from the appropriate Philippine consul<br>the proper visa and thereafter undergo examination by the officers of the Bureau of Immigration at a Philippine port of entry<br>for determination of his admissibility in accordance with the requirements of this Act."<br><br><center>* * * * * * *</center><br>"SEC. 13. Under the conditions set forth in this Act, there may be admitted into the Philippines immigrants, termed 'quota<br>immigrants' not in excess of fifty (50) of any one nationality or without nationality for any one calendar year, except that the<br>following immigrants, termed 'nonquota immigrants, may be admitted without regard to such numerical limitations.<br><br>The corresponding Philippine Consular representative abroad shall investigate and certify the eligibility of a quota immigrant<br>previous to his admission into the Philippines. Qualified and desirable aliens who are in the Philippines under temporary stay<br>may be admitted within the quota, subject to the provision of the last paragraph of section 9 of this Act.<br><br>(a) The wife or the husband or the unmarried child under twenty-one years of age of a Philippine citizen, if accompanying or<br>following to join such citizen:<br><br>(b) A child of alien parents born during the temporary visit abroad of the mother, the mother having been previously<br>lawfully admitted into the Philippines for permanent residence, if the child is accompanying or coming to join a parent and<br>applies for admis sion within five years from the date of its birth;"</blockquote>Concededly, Chan Sau Wah entered the Philippines on a <i>tourist temporary</i> visitor's visa. She is a non-immigrant.<br>Under Section 15 just quoted, she may therefore be admitted if she were a qualified and desirable alien and subject to the<br>provisions of the last paragraph of Section 9. Therefore, first, she must depart voluntarily to some foreign country; second,<br>she must procure from the appropriate consul the proper visa; and third, she must thereafter undergo examination by the<br>officials of the Bureau of Immigration at the port of entry for determination of her admissibility in accordance with the<br>requirements of the Immigration Act.<br><br>This Court in a number of cases has ruled, and consistently too, that an alien admitted as a temporary visitor cannot change<br>his or her status without first departing from the country and complying with the requirements of Section 9 of the<br>Immigration Act. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The gravemen of petitioner's argument is that Chan Sau Wah has, since her entry, married in Manila a native-born Filipino,<br>Esteban Morano. It will not particularly help analysis for petitioners to appeal to family solidarity in an effort to thwart her<br>deportation. Chan Sau Wah, seemingly is not one who has a high regard for such solidarity. Proof: She left two of her<br>children by the first marriage, both minors, in the care of neighbors in Fukien, China.<br><br>Then, the wording of the statute heretofore adverted to is a forbidding obstacle which will prevent this Court from writing<br>into the law an additional provision that marriage of a temporary alien visitor to a Filipino would ipso facto make her a<br>permanent resident in this country. This is a field closed to judicial action. No breadth of discretion is allowed us. We cannot<br>insulate her from the State's power of deportation.<br><br>Really, it would be an easy matter for an alien woman to enter the Philippines as a temporary visitor, go through a mock<br>marriage, but actually live with another man as husband and wife, and thereby skirt the provisions of our immigration law.<br>Also, a woman of undesirable character may enter this country, ply a pernicious trade, marry a Filipino, and again throw<br>overboard Sections 9 and 13 of the Act. Such a flanking movement, we are confident, is impermissible.<br><br>Recently we confirmed the rule that an alien wife of a Filipino may not stay permanently without first departing from the<br>Philippines. Reason: Discourage entry under false pretenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The ruling of the trial court on this score should be reversed.<br><br>4. It is petitioner's turn to point as error the dismissal of the petition for mandamus and prohibition with respect to petitioner<br>Fu Yan Fun.<br><br>Petitioner's line of thought is this: Fu Yan Fun follows the citizenship of his mother. They cite Section 15, paragraph 3,<br>Commonwealth Act 473, which says that:<br><blockquote>"A foreign-born minor child, if dwelling in the Philippines at the time of the naturalization of the parent,<br>shall automatically become a Philippine citizen. * * * "</blockquote>Petitioner's position is based on the assumption that Chan Sau Wah, the mother, is a Filipino citizen. We have held that she is<br>not. At best, Fu Yan Fun is a step-son of Esteban Morano, husband of Chan Sau Wah. A step-son is not a foreign-born child<br>of the step-father. The word child, we are certain, means legitimate child, not a step-child. We are not wanting in<br>precedents.<br><br>Thus, when the Constitution provides that "[t]hose whose fathers are citiaens of the Philippines" are citizens thereof,<sup<br>STYLE="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"&gt;[13] the fundamental charter intends "those" to apply to legitimate children.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In another case, the term "minor children" or "minor child" in<br>Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law refers only to legitimate children of Filipino citizens. This Court, thru Mr. Chief<br>Justice Roberto Concepción, there said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>"It is claimed that the phrases 'minor children' and 'minor child', used in these provisions, include adopted<br>children. The argument is predicated upon the theory that an adopted child is, for all intents and purposes, a legitimate<br>child. Whenever, the word 'children' or 'child' is used in statutes, it is generally understood, however, to refer to legitimate<br>children, unless the context 'of the law and its spirit indicate clearly the contrary. Thus, for instance, when the Constitution<br>provides that 'those whose fathers are citizens of the Philippines', and 'those whose mothers are citizens of the Philippines'<br>who shall elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority' are citizens of the Philippines (Article IV, Section 1,<br>subdivisions [3] and (4]), our fundamental law clearly refers to legitimate children (Chiongbian vs. De Leon, 46 Off. Gaz.,<br>3652-3654; Serra vs. Republic, L-4223, May 12, 1952)."</blockquote>At any rate, Fu Yan Fun entered the Philippines as a temporary visitor. The status of a temporary visitor cannot be converted<br>into that of a permanent resident, as we have heretofore held, without first complying with Section 9 of the Immigration<br>Law.<br><br>5. Petitioners finally aver that the lower court erred in authorizing respondent Commissioner to forfeit the bond filed by<br>petitioners Chan Sau Wah and Fu Yan Fun in the amount of P4,000.00.<br><br>Here is petitioner's posture. They enjoyed their stay in the Philippines upon a bond. Now they come to court and say that as<br>the prescribed form of this bond was not expressly approved by the Secretary of Justice in accordance with Section 3 of<br>Commonwealth Act 613, which reads<br><blockquote>"SEC. 3. * * * He [Commissioner of Immigration] shall issue, subject to the approval of the Department<br>Head, such rules and regulations and prescribe such forms of bond, reports, and other papers, and shall issue from time to<br>time such instruction, not inconsistent with law, as he shall deem best calculated to carry out the provisions of the<br>immigration laws. * * * ". </blockquote>that bond is void.<br><br>Reasons there are which prevent us from giving our imprimatur to this argument.<br><br>The provision requiring official approval of a bond is merely directory. "Irregularity or entire failure in this respect does not<br>affect the validity of the bond." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The ¡reason for the rule is found in 9<br>C.J., p. 26 (footnote), which reads:<br><blockquote>"(a) <i>Reason for rule.</i>—'Statutes requiring bonds to be approved by certain officials <i>are not for<br>the purpose of protecting the obligors</i> in the bond, but are aimed to protect the public, to insure their solvency, and to<br>create evidence of an unimpeachable character of the fact of their execution. When they are executed for a legal purpose,<br>before a proper tribunal, and are in fact accepted and approved by the officer or body, whose duty it was to approve them, it<br>could serve no useful purpose of the law to hold them invalid, to release all the obligors thereon, and to defeat every<br>purpose of its execution, simply because the fact of approval was not indorsed precisely as had been directed by the<br>Legislature.' American Book Co., vs. Wells, 83 SW 622, 627, 26 KyL 1159." (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>And another. This bond was accepted by the government. It has been there. The form of the bond here used is of long<br>continued usage. If the government did not question the form of the bond at all, then we must assume that it counted with<br>the Secretary's approval. For the presumption is that official duty has been legally-performed.<br><br>Surely enough, equitable considerations will stop petitioners from pleading invalidity of the bond. They offered that bond to<br>enable them to enter and stay in this country. They enjoyed benefits therefrom. They cannot, "in law and good conscience,<br>be allowed to reap the fruits" of that bond, and then jettison the same. They are "precluded from attacking the validity" of<br>such bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Actually, to petitioners the bond was good while they sought entry into the Philippines; they offered it as security for the<br>undertaking that they "will actually depart from the Philippines" when their term of stay expires. Now that the bond is being<br>confiscated because they overstayed, they make an about-face and say that such bond is null and void. They shall not profit<br>from this inconsistent position. Their bond should be confiscated.<br><br>Conformably to the foregoing, the judgment under review is hereby modified as follows:<br><br>(1) The portion thereof which reads:<br><blockquote>"(a) Granting this petition for Mandamus and Prohibition with respect to petitioner CHAN SAU WAH, who<br>is hereby declared a citizen of the Philippines; ordering the respondent to cancel her Alien Certificate of Registration and<br>other immigration papers, upon the payment of proper dues; and declaring the preliminary injunction with respect to her<br>permanent, prohibiting the respondent, his representatives or subordinates from arresting and/or deporting said petitioner;"<br></blockquote>is hereby reversed; and, in consequence—<br><br>The petition for mandamus and prohibition with respect to petitioner Chan Sau Wah is hereby denied; and the judgment<br>declaring her a citizen of the Philippines, directing respondent to cancel her Alien Certificate of Registration and other<br>immigration papers, and declaring the preliminary injunction with respect to her permanent, are all hereby set aside; and<br><br>(2) In all other respects, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed.<br><br>No costs.
