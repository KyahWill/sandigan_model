Ramiro V. Aragon, a reserve officer in the active service of the Armed Forces
of the Philippines, exempted from the operation of Sections 1 and 2 of Republic
Act 2334, and permanently enjoining the Secretary of National Defense, the
Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and the Acting <span class="GramE">Chief of
the Philippine Constabulary, from reverting him into inactive status.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute <span style="">as </span>to
the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramiro V. Aragon joined the 7th Allied Intelligence Bureau, 7th
Military District, a duly recognized guerrilla unit, on <st1:date year="1944" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1944</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His name was concededly included in the <u>initial</u> roster<span style=""> </span>of troops of that unit (Appellant's
Brief, p. 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was given the rank of
third lieutenant <span style="">until </span><st1:date year="1945" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1945</st1:date>,
when he was made a second lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By

the rank of a first <span style="">lieutenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In January, 1946, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Aragon</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> was processed, given a serial number

</span>On </span><st1:date year="1947" day="23" month="1"><span style="">January 23, 1947</span></st1:date><span style="">,<span style=""> </span>he
was formally commissioned as first lieutenant in the Reserve Force of the
Philippine Army, and was promoted to captain on </span><st1:date year="1955" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February 1, 1955</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that Aragon was paid his arrears in pay (base
pay and quarters allowance) as third lieutenant, from Jan­uary 10, <span style="">1944 </span>to July 4, 1944, and as second
lieutenant from July 5, 1944 to March 28, 1945; his application for educational
benefits was approved by the Philippine Veterans Board on June 13, 1951, and he
was paid his <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> corresponding to the period of
from February 27, 1945 to September 26, 1945, as evidenced by Acknowledgment
No. 18352<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Bureau of Treasury dated March 24, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1962</st1:date>,
the Philippine Constabulary authorities issued Special Order No. 196,
providing, among other things, for the reversion of Captain Ramiro <st1:country-region><st1:place>Aragon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to inactive status, effective <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="6">June 19,
 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sent a letter to
the Secretary of National Defense, through the Armed Forces Chief of Staff,
requesting for reconsideration of the aforesaid Special Order; and receiving no
reply thereto, <span style="">Aragon
</span><span style="">instituted on June 11, 1962, in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, prohibition
proceedings against therein respondents Secretary of National Defense, the
Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and <span style="">the Acting Chief of the Philippine
Constabulary or their agents to prohibit or enjoin petitioner's reversion to
inactive status.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents tried to justify the disputed Special Order allegedly
issued pursuant to Section 2 of Republic Act 2334, directing the reversion into
inactive status of reserve officers on active duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged that petitioner has to his
credit only a total of 7 years, 10 months and 24 days of active accumulated
commissioned service, computed from his formal commission into the Army on <st1:date year="1947" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1947</st1:date>, or short of the
10-year period required under Republic Act 1382 and, consequently, he falls
within the coverage of Republic Act 2334.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's voluntary civilian (guerrilla) service from <st1:date year="1944" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1944</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1947" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1947</st1:date> was not considered in
computing his total accumulated service, because petitioner's name does not
appear in the approved reconstructed roster of his guerrilla unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents also put up the defenses of
non-exhaustion of administrative remedies and the impropriety of prohibition
proceedings to secure the relief sought by peti­tioner.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1963</st1:date>,
judgment was rendered for the petitioner; the trial Court declared him exempted
from the operation of Republic Act 2334, and respondents were permanently
enjoined from ordering the reversion of petitioner to inactive status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respon­dents interposed the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy in this case arose from the enforcement of the
following provisions of Republic Act 2334:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span> After the approval of this
Act, and except in time of emergency, <span style="">no </span>reserve officer shall be called to
extended tours of active duty exceeding a total of two years within any period
of five consecutive years:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, <u>That
reserve officers on active duty for more than two years</u> on the date of
approval of this Act, with the exception of those covered by section three of
this Act, <u>shall be reverted to inactive status</u> within three years from
the approval of this Act: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 3.</span> <u>The </u><u><span style="">p</span>rovisions of section</u> two of this
Act <u>shall not a</u><u><span style="">pp</span>ly to
reserve officers covered by the provisions of Republic Act </u><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nu</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">mbered Thirtee</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">n</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
hundred eighty-two</span></u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Republic Act 1382 referred to above, and
approved on <st1:date year="1955" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1955</st1:date>,
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span> <u>Reserve Officers</u><u><span style=""> </span></u><u><span style="">with </span>at least ten years </u><u><span style="">of </span>active accumulated commissioned service</u> who are still <span style="">on active duty at the time of the approval of
this Act <u>shall not be reverted into inactive status except for cause</u>
after proper court martial proceedings or upon their own request:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That for purposes of computing the
length of service, six months or more of active service shall be considered one
year." (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As appellants themselves put it, the main question here is whether
or not as of <st1:date year="1955" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1955</st1:date>,
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had at least 10 years of
accumulated active commissioned service in the Philippine Army to his credit,
to entitle him to exemption from the operation of Republic Act 2334.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
service <span style="">as </span>a regularly
commissioned officer commenced only on July 23, <span style="">1947, the issue calls for a determination of
whether or not his voluntary civilian (guerilla) service, from January 10, 1944
to January 23, 1947, </span>should be considered active commissioned service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> argument, that his guerilla
service should be included in the computation of his accumulated active
military service, <span style="">is based on Executive
Order No. 21, of the late President Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>,
issued on </span><st1:date year="1944" day="28" month="10"><span style="">October 28, 1944</span></st1:date><span style=""> reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">6. A recognized military force, <span style="">as </span>used herein, is defined as a <span style="">force </span>under a Commander who has been
appointed, designat<span style="">ed or recognized by </span>the
Commander-in-Chief, Southwest <span style="">Pacific
Area." (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants do not contest the applicability of the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> presidential order to guerrilla-services like
those of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is claimed, however, that said executive order is not by itself self-<span class="SpellE">executory</span>; that the benefits granted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
may only be availed of by persons whose claims were duly verified and whose
names were included in the roster of recognized guerrillas; and, since the name
of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is not carried in the revised roster<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of members of the military unit to which he supposedly belonged, then for all
intents and purposes, he is an unrecognized guerrilla whose services cannot be
considered active commissioned service in the Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, notwithstanding appellants'
acknowledgment or ad­mission of <u>the</u> <u>fact</u> that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
had been initially a member of a legitimate guerrilla organization as of
January 10, 1944 (pp. 3-4, Appellants' brief), they would not credit him for
such services and would withhold the benefits to which he may be entitled by
reason thereof, simply because his name is not in the roster of recognized
guerrillas.</p>

<p class="BODY">For legal and equitable considerations, appellants' theory must
be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entries in the Army's
roster of recognized guerrillas, assuming them to be the official acts of duly
authorized public officers, are merely <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u> evidence of the facts
therein stated.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, this roster or list is not
to be considered the sole and exclusive evidence of the <span style="">government's </span><span style="">recognition of the actual services of civilian </span>volunteers; there
is nothing in the law making inadmissible other proof of such recogni­tion,
where they are material and relevant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore the recognized roster (<span style="">drawn up primarily </span>for <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> purposes)
must yield to the initial roster, which shows that appellant was already
serving even six months before the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
landing of the liberation troops.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the present case, there can be no other logical
conclusion than that the Philippine government recognized <span class="SpellE">appellee'<span style="">s</span></span><span style=""> </span>war-time and post liberation services in the army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only does <span class="SpellE"><span style="">appellee's</span></span><span style=""> name appear in the initial roster, but he
was </span><span style="">paid<br>
</span><span style="">the corresponding officer's base
pay and quarter's allowance, </span>from January 10, 1944 to March 28, 1945, as
"a member of the Army of the Philippines in the service of the United
States Armed Forces" (Annex B, p. 14, C.F.I. Record); there was
recognition of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> guerrilla services when he <span style="">was </span>given <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> for services rendered from February 27, 1945 to
September 26, 1945, <span style="">in an
Acknowledgment by the National Treasurer dated March 24, 1960; when the
Philippine Veterans Board approved his claim for educational benefits; when the
military authorities themselves formally commissioned him in the Philippine
Army, by considering his voluntary civilian services as proper substitute for
actual combat duty - a prerequisite to such commission (Annex E, pp. 20-21, </span>C<span style="">. F. I. Record); and when he was promoted as
captain (permanent) on February 1, 1955.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can it </span>be <span style="">argued
that these benefits were granted on the erroneous assumption that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was a recognized guerrilla, because some of them
were given or made long after the roster of members of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
guerrilla unit was revised, and <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> name was
left out <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the circumstances, and there being adequate showing that
petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> volunteer civilian services
started since January 10, 1944, and were duly recognized by the Philippine
government, it would be inequitable to deny him the rights duly appertaining to
one with such accumulated length of service in the military, just because for
reason or reasons not disclosed in the records, his name did not appear in the
revised list of recognized guerrillas.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's allegation that there was failure to exhaust
administrative remedies in this <span class="GramE">case,</span> is, similarly,
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present proceedings,
having been brought against a department secretary, an <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u>
of the President, and allegedly involving a threatened violation or disregard
of the petitioner's right that requires immediate judicial intervention, the
rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies may be relaxed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is equally no necessity for the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to be <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unlike in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ruperto</u></span><u> vs.
Moore</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which essentially involved a pecuniary claim against the Treasury of the United
States (payment of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>), and consequently, the
latter <span style="">government must be </span><span style="">given opportunity
to be heard, the issue </span><span style="">in the
case at bar concerns only the validity of the Armed Forces Special Order
reverting herein petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to inactive
status in the Reserve Force, which order he claims to be in violation of his
right as an officer with the required minimum length of service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
