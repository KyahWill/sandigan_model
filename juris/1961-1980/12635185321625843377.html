<p class="BODY">Acting upon said report, the Board of Commissioners reviewed <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> the
decision of the Special Board of Inquiry in the cases of Carlos, <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>, Domingo and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>
(I. C. Nos. 61-2966-C, 61-2967-C, 61-2974-C, and 61-2965-C), and on 20 June
1962 ruled for the exclusion of the latter on the grounds (1) that the alleged <span class="SpellE">filiation</span> of applicants to Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>
alias Co <span class="SpellE">Chii</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> had not

as Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>, the latter having been found to
be a fraud and an impostor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Com­missioner
of Immigration likewise revoked the <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="8">30

declaring Co <span class="SpellE">Chii</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>,

knowingly misrepresented himself as a Filipino citizen born of Filipino parents

investigation of the admission cases of Carlos, <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>,
Domingo and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>, such false
statements and misrepresentation resulting in his alleged sons being admitted

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="3">29 March 1965</st1:date>,
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>, alias Co <span class="SpellE">Chii</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>, commenced in the Court of First Instance of
Manila a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding (Civil Case No. 60384) to nullify the
aforementioned orders of the Commissioner and to restrain the hearing of the
exclusion or deportation charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="3">3 March 1966</st1:date>, the
lower court rendered decision dismissing the petition and sustaining the
disputed orders of the Immigration Commissioner, upon the finding that the
petitioner (appellant herein) is a fraud and an impostor, who had misrepresented
himself as Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>, when the real person by
that name is actually living and may be found in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> (<st1:place><st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also ruled that a writ of <i>certiorari</i>
is not the proper remedy in the case, a <u>habeas corpus</u> proceeding or
recourse to administrative officials being more appropriate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to this Court by way of the present appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner-appellant now contends that for the court <u>a quo</u> to find that
he is a fraud and an impostor, based merely on the <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
report of certain immigra­tion officers and rendered without notice and hearing
on him, constitutes a deprivation of his liberty without due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in this contention of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For aside from the report adverted to, the
records of the case which the trial judge must have duly considered in reaching
the disputed, judgment, contain other, evidence supporting the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, attached to the records is a sworn
statement of one <span style="">Jesus </span><span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> an employee of a <span style="">mining </span>company in Mountain Province, given to immigration officers
<span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Yapchiongco</span>,
Jr., on 31 May 1962, to the effect that he is the son of Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span> <span class="SpellE">Corres</span>, born in 1911 at San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>;
that his parents have no other son named Jesus but he; that he had previously
met appellant (whose picture was shown to him), who was introduced to him by
his former common-law wife, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiosen</span>, as Miguel Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
There is also the statement under oath of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>, a businessman of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, that his parents are Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span> <span class="SpellE">Corres</span> of <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>;
that he has a brother named Jesus who was then working as a policeman in the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Consolidated Mines in Mountain Province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shown a picture of appellant, this <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> denied that the person pictured is his brother
Jesus; that there could be no other Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>,
son of Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corres</span> of <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>, than his
abovementioned brother.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides these positive and <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> declarations
that appellant is not the Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> that he
represents himself to be, there are certain discrepancies in the record that
justify the denial of appellant's petition in the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, during the investigation of
appellant's claim conducted by the Citizenship Evalua­tion Board on 27 July
1960, appellant declared that he was recognized by, and got reunited with, his
"real" parents (meaning the <span class="SpellE">Contemprates</span>)
in 1951<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
changing it later to 1950<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>;
whereas witness Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> stated that he and his
wife met the appellant in 1956<span class="GramE">,or</span> Just 4 years before
that hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, appellant alleged that <span style="">it was in
</span>1949, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
when he was informed for the first time by <span style="">his </span>Chinese foster mother that his parents were Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span> <span class="SpellE">Corres</span> who were still alive and residing at <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>, in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And yet, according to Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span> <span class="SpellE">Corres</span>, they had never
communicated <span style="">with</span> nor<span style=""> </span>heard from appellant's father, Co
Cue, or from appellant himself, ever since the latter, at age four months, was
allegedly brought to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by said Co Cue.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>These discrepancies we consider
significant, because appellant's recital of the supposed circumstances
surrounding his assumption of the name <u>Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span></u>
appears to be founded on a phenomenal <span style="">Series
</span>of coincidences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he would
like us to believe that in 1950, upon being informed by his Chinese parents
that his real parentage is <span style="">Filipino,
with­</span>out prior verification thereof, he had stopped <span style="">renewing his alien </span>registration
because he considered himself already a Filipino. But what is noteworthy is
that it was also in 1950 when appellant met <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiosen</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
who “happened" to know the alleged parents of appellant, Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span> <span class="SpellE">Corres</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Tiosen</span> who accompanied appellant to meet the couple in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The web of circumstances thus worked out is much too coincidental to be
true and is rendered <span style="">vul­</span>nerable
by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiose</span>
had cohabited for about seven years with, and had two children by, the man who
bears the name of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span>, and is the son
of Juan <span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> and <span class="SpellE">Prisca</span>
<span class="SpellE">Corres</span>, and who, in 1965, was working for a mining
company in Mountain Province.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another point that deserves notice is the improper attitude
appellant has towards Philippine laws and authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, although the duly constituted
government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
restarted functioning in 1945, it was only in 1946 that appellant registered as
an alien and was issued an alien registration certificate.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, without proper order from government authorities, and allegedly only upon
being informed by his Chinese mother that his real parents were Filipinos, he
just stopped renewing his alien registration in 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet he did not take any steps to secure recognition
of his alleged Philippine citizenship until ten years later, on <st1:date year="1960" day="13" month="6">13 June 1960</st1:date>, when he requested the
Immigration Commissioner to cancel his alien certificate of registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if he were to be believed,
appellant, for a period of 10 years, was passing himself off as a Filipino even
without previous appropriate verification of his citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To cap it all, this appellant admitted in his
1964 sworn statement (Annex 9 of the Respondent's answer below) that the four
persons he had claimed under oath at the 1961 proceedings before the
Immigration Board of Inquiry to be his children, and who were admitted as a
result of his claim, were not really his children (Annex 9, page 3, Record,
page 8). Appellant thereby admitted his <span style="">perjury
</span>and utterly destroyed his own credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that the order of <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="8">30 August 1960</st1:date>, whereby Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> ordered the <span style="">cancellation
of </span>his alien registration, and the correction of his status as a child
of Filipino parents, is <span style="">already </span>final
and <span class="SpellE">unreviewable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This claim is unmeritorious, because the reinvestigation of appellant's
case was ordered as early <span style="">as </span><st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="8"><span style="">18 A</span><span style="">ugust </span><span style="">1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, w</span>ithin
one year from the <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> resolution, so that the
latter did not acquire finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Talabis</span></span><span style=""> order </span>was
obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, for which reason it was ultimately
revoked.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also complains <span style="">that
in the </span>revocation of the <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> order, <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> his alien registration, the respondent
Commissioner took into account the affidavits of Jesus and <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Contemprate</span> which were given <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> and without notice to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, he has not shown that the
testimony of said witnesses is untrue; nor had he asked from the Immigration
authorities an opportunity to examine them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the second place, even without such testimony, as we have shown,
there are on record sufficient circumstances unfavorable to this peti­<span style="">tioner to </span>justify respondent's
conclusion that he is not what he pretends to be, and that the order this petitioner
complains of had the support of substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, petitioner will still have
opportunity to rebut the evidence against him at the hearings on whether he
should <span style="">be </span>deported or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we must sustain appellant’s plea against the correctness
and propriety of the warrant of arrest issued in this case, to secure the
presence of said appellant in the hearing of the charges against him for
alleged violation of Section 37 (a) (9) in relation to Section 45(f) of the
Philippine Immigration Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule now
established in this jurisdiction circumscribes the authority to issue the same
only to judges, where the purpose of the warrant is merely the determination of
the existence of probable cause in a given case,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
with the power of the Immigration Commissioner to issue similar warrants being
confined to those neces<span style="">sary </span>for
the execution of a final deportation order.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The Immigration authorities, on the other hand, cannot protest that the ruling
renders them helpless or ineffective in securing attendance before them of
person charged of violation of the laws on immigration.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For their recourse has been amply provided
when this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"We see no reason why the cautionary bond requirement of the
1947 Executive Order No. 69 of President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> should
not apply to deportation proceedings initiated by <span style="">the Immigration Commis</span>sioners, considering the Identity of ends
sought to be served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">notice and bonds should suffice </span>to <span style="">ensure the subject's appearance at the
hearings, </span>without prejudice to more drastic measures in case of
recalcitrant respondents. But as long as the<span style=""> </span>illegal entry or offense of <span style="">the

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the de­cision of the
court <u>a quo</u> is hereby modified, being reversed insofar as it denies
issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> against the warrant for the arrest of
appellant, issued by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Commissioner of
Immigration, which is declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This shall be without prejudice to petitioner's being required to
furnish such reasonable bond as the Commissioner of Immigration may fix, to
guarantee this appellant's appearance at the hearings for his deportation, and
at all other administrative proceedings wherein his right to stay in the
Philippines is to be passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all
other respects, the appealed judgment is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
