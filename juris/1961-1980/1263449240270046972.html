				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.P., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A 200-hectare land, known as Hacienda del Rosario, owned in
common by Vicente <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Ceferina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> del Rosario and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> Reyes, and administered by <span class="SpellE">Dios­dado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Larrazabal</span>, has been devoted to large-scale sugar cane
planting, processing and milling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
co-owners also leased and applied to the same purpose a 107-hectare land owned
by the Roman Catholic Church and <span style="">administered </span>by His Excellency, Archbishop
Julio Rosales.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the above-named persons the <span style="">PLASLU </span><span style="">(Philip</span>pine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union) filed before the Court of
Industrial Relations on June <span style="">30, 1958, </span>a
charge of unfair labor practice, for alleged violation of Section 4-A of
Republic Act <span style="">875 </span>consisting in
dismissals of <span style="">87 </span>workers in said
hacienda due to membership in petitioning union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PLASLU asked that respondents be ordered to
cease and de­sist from such unfair labor practice and to reinstate the
laborers, with back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the
Court of Industrial Relations had no jurisdic­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Action thereon was deferred. Respondents
thereaf­ter answered, on July 20, <span style="">1960,
</span>alleging <span style="">lack </span>of juris­diction, questioning the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">PLASLU's</span></span><span style=""> </span>personality to sue, and denying liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rendering its decision on May 11, <span style="">1963, </span>the Court of Industrial Relations upheld <span class="SpellE">PLASLU's</span> legal capacity to <span style="">sue and ruled that it had jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that about fifty of the hacienda
workers were dismissed by respondents for reasons of union member­ship, it
ordered respondents to reinstate them with back wages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was lodged with the Court of
Industrial Relations <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolving the same on December <span style="">13,
<span style="">1963, </span></span><span style="">said</span> <span style="">Court </span>ruled that in ac­cordance with
the doctrine <span style="">in
<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling </span>Co. v. CIR, <span style="">L-17281, </span>March <span style="">30, 1963, </span>the complaint should be dismissed as to the
agricultural workers such <span style="">as </span>field laborers planting and harvesting sugar cane in the ha­cienda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to those whose work is by nature
industrial, like the mill laborers, <span class="SpellE">trapicheros</span>, chemists,
<span class="SpellE">fuelmen</span>, <span class="SpellE">oilers</span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>mangongogay</u></span>,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span> tractor and
truck drivers, those undertaking or transporting the sugar cane from the field
to the mill and then to the market, it held that the same doctrine sustained
its jurisdiction, thereby affirming the decision as to <span style="">said </span>industrial workers.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span> and poise the
following questions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does the Court of
Industrial Relations have jurisdiction over the case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it does, is the finding of unfair labor
practice supported by substantial evidence?</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue leads <span class="GramE">Us</span> to consider Our
<span style="">ruling in </span><span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Sugar <span style="">Mills </span>v. <span class="SpellE">Pasumil</span>
Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Vic­torias</span></span><span style=""> Milling Co., </span>v.
CIR, <span style="">supra.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the <span class="SpellE"><u>Pasumil</u></span> case, We held that where "petitioner is
a highly mechanized industrial concern with the work of planting and harvesting
clearly distinguished from that of transporting the cane from the fields, first
to a switch and later to the <span style="">mill ... all its </span>workers are to be considered industrial workers,
except those devoted to purely agricultural work." (<span class="GramE">at</span>
p. 561) Reiterating this, <span class="GramE">We</span> said <span style="">in </span>the <st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Victorias</u></span></st1:place></st1:state> case that it is
"the nature of the work which classifies a worker as one fall­ing under
the exemption [from coverage of R.A. <span style="">875]
</span>as agricultural laborers."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="GramE">an</span> hacienda, there may therefore be
both agricul­tural and industrial workers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Regarding the former, exclusive jurisdiction has been given to the Court
of Agrarian Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As to the latter, exclusive jurisdiction has been placed in the
Court of Industrial Relations.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards those workers who perform functions the nature of
which is industrial, therefore, suit was pro­perly filed in the Court of
Industrial Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against petitioners' contention to the contrary, the record shows
that the petitioners' undertaking is a mechanized one, rendering applicable the
norm set forth in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Victorias</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Pasumil</u></span> cases:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) Petitioners alrea­dy owned 200 hectares, yet they leased 107
hectares more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be very
difficult for them to profitably carry on under conditions they alleged unless
the haciendas are mechanized; (2) Petitioners had 2 <span style="">mills in </span>the haciendas - one in their own and another in the land
leased; (3) The field workers were different from the mill workers, showing
specialization in the kind of work done; (4) The presence of a timekeeper and
inspector in the ha­cienda, showing that the workers had a working schedule,
and laborers were made to sign payrolls, a practice typical of industrial
concerns; <span style="">(5) </span>The positions in
question, mill laborers, <span class="SpellE">trapicheros</span>, chemists, <span class="SpellE">fuelmen</span>, <span class="SpellE">oilers</span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>mangongogay</u></span>, tractor and truck drivers, those
involving taking or transporting sugar cane from the <span style="">field </span>to the <span style="">mill </span>and
to the market, are positions commonly found in industrial concerns.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners’ liability </span>for
unfair labor practice is thus premised on Sec. 4-A of Republic Act <span style="">875, </span>not under Republic Act <span style="">2263.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
industrial employees, the labor­ers in the positions aforementioned were
already covered by Republic Act <span style="">875, </span>even
before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of R.A. <span style="">2263, </span>and were so covered when they
were dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Petitioners</span> claim that the findings of
unfair labor practice is not supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They failed however to show why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners cite the <span style="">dis­</span>senting opinion of Judge <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> who believed that there was no illegal dismissal
because in letters dated March 18 and <span style="">31,
1958, </span>complainants through their lawyer claimed back wages and overtime
pay <u>without men­tion of their alleged dismissal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This however does not indicate that there was
no such dismissal, for it could also mean that said laborers at first would
have been con­tented with payment of back wages and overtime pay; but that
later, when refused payment thereof, they decided to ask for reinstatement also
and thus raised the ground of dismissal as an unfair labor practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners stress that 24 [actually, the CIR said <span style="">20] </span>of the <span style="">87 </span>complainants were found never to have worked at all in the
hacienda, and that 16 [actually, the CIR said 14]<span style=""> </span>moved to dismiss the complaint with re­gard to their
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All this does not alter the find­ing
that the others were illegally dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither do we find significant the fact that only seven witnesses were
presented to support the charge, as long as the low­er court found them
credible; the same is true of petitioners’ observation that the witnesses did
not agree as to the precise date of their dismissal, whether March <span style="">18 </span>or <span style="">19, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The fact is
that substantial evidence there <span style="">is, </span>behind
the finding that petitioners dismissed the la­borers in question in March of <span style="">1958 </span>for reason of union
membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The submission that said
laborers resigned freely, or <span class="GramE">were</span> no longer employed
by then, or that their dismissals were prompted by financial difficul­ties, was
rejected below as not credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
matters relate to findings of facts in regard to which the determinations of
the Court of Industrial Relations are conclusive where, as in this case, it has
substantial evidence to rest upon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision and resolution of the
Court of Industrial Relations are hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against petitioners.</span></p>
