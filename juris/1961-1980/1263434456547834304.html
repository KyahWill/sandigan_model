L-29891, Aug. 30, 1971, 40 SCRA 391.) We believe that the trial court complied
with its duty in accepting the plea of guilty and that the appellant had full
knowledge of its consequences when he voluntarily entered the plea in the light
of the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
change of plea was made with the assistance of counsel; (2) the trial court
declared a recess to enable the accused and his counsel to confer in respect of
the change of plea; (3) the trial court explicitly told the accused that as a
consequence of his plea of guilty he "will be punished by death or life
imprisonment;" and (4) the evidence for the prosecu­tion had already shown
his guilt independently of his plea.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant has made no

<blockquote>"Sometime, in the latter part of October, 1968, the
accused-appellant Mario <span class="SpellE">Rabuya</span> and five (5) others
namely, Bert <span class="SpellE">Gumera</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Carralos</span>,
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sojian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Beneficio</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> and Ferdinand Camacho, met at Apartment No. 2408 in <span class="SpellE">Cementina</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, to
plot the hold-up of a Philippine Airlines night flight from <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to Manila (pp. 45, 46 and 47, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., March 4, 1969).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to such conspiracy, accused-appellant Mario <span class="SpellE">Rabuya</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Galleto</span>, armed with a .45 caliber pistol; <span class="SpellE">Beneficio</span> <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>, armed with a
.38 cal. revolver; Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sojian</span>, also armed with a
.38 cal. revolver; and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Carralos</span>, armed with a
.32 cal. pistol, boarded a PAL Fokker Plane at 3:15 o'clock p.m. on November 6,
1968, at the domestic airport in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, bound
for <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (pp. 52 and 54, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
id.) At past 6:00 o'clock p.m. on the same day, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Gumera</span>
borrowed the car of his stepfather, and in the company of Ferdinand Camacho,
proceeded to the Domestic Airport in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City (p.
56, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.) and from there, they motored to the
South Super-Highway in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
bet­ween 8:33 and 8:40 p.m. to wait for the return of their four companions
from <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (p. 57, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
id.) At about <st1:time minute="45" hour="21">9:45 p.m.</st1:time>, Bert <span class="SpellE">Gumera</span> and Ferdinand Camacho saw an airplane landing near
the Super-Highway with the lights and engine off (pp. 58 and 59, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
one reason or another, their four companions who were expected to arrive on the
said airplane did not show up (p. 59, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Bert <span class="SpellE">Gumera</span>
and Ferdinand Camacho returned to the apartment at <span class="SpellE">Cementina</span>
St., and at around 11:00 o'clock p.m., Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Carralos</span>
arrived informing them that one of their companions, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sojian</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Loloy</span>), had been wounded (pp. 61 and 62, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Carralos</span> also handed to Camacho a
paper bag containing money, jewelry, and some 15 to 20 watches (pp. 64 and 65, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As no
doctor could be called to provide medical attend­ance to the wounded Felipe <span class="SpellE">Sojian</span>, the latter presumably died, and his "body
disposed of" by his companions (pp. 72-73, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

up from their seats and went to the rear of <span style="">the aircraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Minutes later, or
approximately 45 minutes before landing time at the Manila Domestic Terminal,
gunshots were fired by the appellant and his companions from the rear of the

</span>After the shooting, one of the gunmen, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Carralos</span>,
poked his gun at the pilot, Luis <span class="SpellE">Bonnevie</span>, Jr.,
saying "this is a hijack" (p. 48, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
March 3, 1969), and almost simultaneously, another of the hi­jackers shouted,
"everybody down, hold-up" (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

sat down without a word of protest, </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">the hijackers

was operated on at the Manila Doctor's Hospital and during, the operation, a
slightly deformed jacketed bullet which approximates the size of a .45 caliber

firearm was likewise extracted from the body of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagaran</span> (p. 18, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.), and according to NBI medico-legal expert Dr.
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Cueva</span>, who performed the necropsy exa­mination
on the remains of said deceased, the two gunshot wounds that killed him were
indeed inflicted by .45 caliber firearm (pp. 16, 19, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Cueva</span>
also testified that any of both wounds could have caused the death of <span class="SpellE">Pagaran</span> independently of each other (p. 21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's plea of guilty, his statements on the witness stand,
the admissions made in his affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. U) dated <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1968</st1:date>, which he did not
repudiate that he was a party to the agreement to rob the plane, and the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses conclusively establish his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant questions the appreciation of the aggravating
circumstances alleged in the information in the imposition of the death
penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elementary is the rule that a
plea of guilty cons­titutes an admission of all the material facts alleged in
the infor­mation, including the aggravating circumstances recited therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs. <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valera</span></st1:place></st1:city> and Imperial, G.R. No.
L-37016, <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1979</st1:date>.) But
the plea of guilty notwithstanding the prosecution had sufficiently established
the aggravating circumstances recited in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as to <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>,
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Gumera</span> and Ferdinand Camacho were to meet
their fellow conspirators at the South Superhighway in the evening as in fact
they went there between <st1:time minute="33" hour="8">8:33</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="40" hour="20">8:40 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only explanation for this time factor was for the appellant and his
companions to better attain and facilitate the planned plane robbery under the
cover of darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of a motor
vehicle to facilitate the commission of the crime was also proved for it is a
fact that <span class="SpellE">Gumera</span> and Camacho used a jeep to
rendezvous with their companions at the South Superhighway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, as to the commission of the crime by
a band, suffice it to say that the appellant and his three com<span style="">panions were all armed with pistols when they
boarded the ill-fated PAL flight from <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We now consider the alleged mitigating circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims his plea of guilty should be taken as a
mitigating circumstance although it was not made prior to the presentation of
the evidence for the prosecution on the ground <span style="">that it was an act of repentance and respect for the law, indicating a
moral disposition favorable to his reform.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In support thereof, it is asserted that none of the witnesses ever
declared having seen the accused take actual part in the commission of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Solicitor
General that this claim is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For as stated in the People's brief:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"when appellant suddenly stood up and manifested his desire to
plead guilty, it was already after the prosecution had almost finished with the
presentation of its evidence consisting of the testimonies of eight witnesses
who identified material documentary evidence in the course of their
testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the testimony of
accused-turned-state witness Ferdinand Camacho (p. 48, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
March 4, 1969), the existence of a conspiracy between appellant and his five
com­panions to commit the robbery charged was clearly and definitely
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, through the
testimony of Camacho, it was also established that among the four-armed
conspirators who board a PAL plane for <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to
execute the planned robbery on the return flight of the PAL from <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> to Manila, appellant was the only one carrying a .45
cal. firearm, the others having been armed either with .38 cal. or .32 cal.
revolvers (pp. 52, 54, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.) Then, through the
testimony of prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, one of the victims of the gunfire on the occasion
of said robbery and who luckily survived his wounds, appellant's active role
and participation in the robbery and his having joined his companions at the
rear of the plane minutes before gunfire came from that direction of the plane
(pp. 28-29, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., id.) was also clearly and
sufficiently established."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that the appellant took the witness stand for
the purpose of proving mitigating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted here that the trial court
in sentencing him did not bother to assess the merits of his testimonial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such cavalier treatment is to
be deplored and condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although we
are perhaps more busy, we shall, with patience, deal with the matter in a
manner not callous.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant insists that he had no intention to commit so grave a
wrong for when he joined <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Shoppi</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Loloy</span> he did not know of their plan to carry out
a robbery and he fired at Agent <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> only after
he had seen <span class="SpellE">Loloy</span> wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in his affidavit, Exhibit U, appellant
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Our plan was that I, ZALDY,
LOLOY <span style="">and CLEOFE [SHOPPI] will board
the plane and rob and when the airplane reach the airport in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> we will be met by BERT SANDOVAL and EDDIE
CAMACHO and they have a vehicle ready for our use from the airport to <span class="SpellE">Cementina</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasay</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">." And his claim that he shot Agent <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> because he saw <span class="SpellE">Loloy</span>
wounded is too crude to be convincing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, it is a fact that he shot not only <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>
but also <span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagaran</span>
for their wounds were inflicted by a .45 caliber gun and the appellant was the
only member of the band armed with that type of pistol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, appellant claims
that "the facts that, according to his recorded testimony which the
prosecution has not chosen to refute or disprove, he yielded to arrest without
the slightest attempt to resist and he has never before this case been con­victed
of, or involved in, any crime" should be taken as analogous mitigating
circumstances in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 13,
par. 10, Revised Penal Code.) But to quote the Solicitor General again:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As regard appellant's having allegedly yielded to arrest
without the <span style="">slightest attempt at
resistance, again </span>this circumstance, even if true, is not one of the
mitigating circums­tances recognized by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the law con­siders as mitigating is the voluntary surrender of the
accused before his arrest, showing either an acknowledgment of his guilt or an
intention to save the authorities the trouble and expense that would be
incurred in his search and capture (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Conwi</span>,
