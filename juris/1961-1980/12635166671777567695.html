				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal on questions of law from the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila dismissing plaintiff's complaint against defendants
Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service and/or Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff filed this action originally in the City Court of
Manila for recovery against defendants of the insurance value of certain cargo
consigned to Edward Manufacturing Corporation, which insured it against loss
with the plaintiff for the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,535.39</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cargo arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on board the SS "PIONEER MING" on <st1:date year="1962" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1962</st1:date> and was discharged into the custody of
the defendant Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service which was then
operated by the Bureau of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
cargo, however, was not delivered to the consignee, as it was burned with other
cargo during the fire that gutted Shed B, Pier 9, on <st1:date year="1962" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Formal claim for non-delivery was duly filed
with the Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> Service on behalf of the
consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consignee was paid the
full insurable value of the lost cargo in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,535.39</span>
by plaintiff, which then filed this case as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
of the consignee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The City Court
rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff, but on appeal, the Court of First
Instance of Manila, after trial, rendered its decision of December 2, 1965
dismissing the complaint, holding that the defendants' obligation to deliver
the cargo had been extinguished by virtue of the fire which had not been shown
to be due to defendants' negligence and that the action at any rate, being
directed against the Republic of the Philippines, of which the defendant Bureau
of Customs and its <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service is a mere arm or
agency, was barred by the State's immunity from suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, on appeal, assigned principally these two rulings of
the trial court as being contrary to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will readily be seen that the ruling first enunciated by this
Court in <u>Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. vs. Customs <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service and Bureau of Customs</u> on December 17, 1966<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and subsequently affirmed and
reaffirmed in a long line of cases, most recently in <u>Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Maersk</span> Line Far East Service</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and <u>Ins. Co. North America vs. Osaka <span class="SpellE">Shosen</span>
Kaisha, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>,
both promulgated on March 28, 1969, is controlling and decisive of the present
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in the Mobil case
disposes of plaintiff-appellant's contentions and indicates the remedy
available to it and others similarly situated, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Now, the fact that a non-corporate government entity performs
a function proprietary in nature does not necessarily result in its being <span class="SpellE">suable</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If said
non-governmental function is undertaken as an incident to its governmental
function, there is no waiver thereby of the sovereign immunity from suit
extended to such government entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is the doctrine recognized in Bureau of Printing, et al. vs. Bureau of Printing
Employees Association, et al., L-15751, January 28, <span style="">1961:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The Bureau of Customs, to repeat, is part of the
Department of Finance (Sec. 81, Rev. Adm. Code), with no personality of its own
apart from that of the national government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its primary function is governmental, that of assessing and collecting
lawful revenues from impor­ted articles and all other tariff and customs
duties, fees, charges, fines and penalties (Sec. 602, R. A. 1937).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this function, <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service is a necessary incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Clearly, therefore, although said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
function may be deemed proprietary, it is a necessary incident of the primary
and governmental function of the Bureau of Customs, so that engaging in the
same does not necessary render said Bureau liable to suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For otherwise, it could not
perform its governmental function without necessarily exposing itself to suit.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sovereign immu­nity, granted as to the end,
should not be denied as to the necessary mea n s to that end.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Regardless of the merits of the claim against it, the State,
for obvious reasons of public policy, cannot be sued without its consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff should have filed<span style=""> </span>its present claim to the General
Auditing Office, it being for money under the provisions of Commonwealth Act
327, which state the conditions under which money claims against the Government
may be filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It must be remembered that statutory provisions waiving State
immunity from suit are strictly construed and that waiver of immunity, being in
derogation of sovereignty, will not be lightly inferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Prom the provision
authorizing the Bureau of Customs to lease <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations
to private parties, <span class="GramE">We</span> see no authority to sue the
said Bureau in the instances where it undertakes to conduct said operation
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bu­reau of Customs, acting
as part of the machinery of the national government in the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service, pursuant to express legislative mandate
and as a necessary incident of its prime governmental function, is immune from
suit, there being no statute to the contrary." (18 SCRA, pp. 1124-1127.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of the court <u>a quo</u>
dismissing the complaint is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.<i style=""><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
