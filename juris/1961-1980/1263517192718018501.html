the nature of four of the wounds, they must have been inflicted while the
victim was in a lying position; that any of the six wounds sustained by the

drunk; that he brought the two to the municipal jail to sober up; that when he
returned to the municipal building at about seven o'clock in the evening he
informed the two that they could already go home, but the latter requested that
they be allowed to stay because there was no more train trip at that time;
that, by mistake, the jail was locked, so that Santiago and <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tationghari</span> remained inside until he (the witness)
reported for duty at about nine o'clock of the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incident allegedly was recorded in the

stopped working on his plow at about 6:30 in the afternoon until the time the
witness went to sleep at past 8 o'clock <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span> was in
his house; that he (Javier) left Port' Junction at about 7 o'clock in the
morning of 26 August 1954, after he was told by <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span>
that the repair of the plow cannot be continued because a relative of his,
referring to Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span>, had died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused TIBURCIO LALOGO, like the others, denied the charge that
he took part in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;

evening and learned of the death of Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> only
in the morning of <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="8">26 August 1954</st1:date>

Japanese occupation; that on 25 August 1954, when <span class="SpellE">Eje</span>
met him at the railroad station, the former asked him if he still bore grudge
against him (<span class="SpellE">Eje</span>); that <span class="SpellE">Eje</span>
slapped him, but when <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> drew his bolo from its scabbard
he (<span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>) also took hold of his bolo and hit the
former successively, killing him; that, at the time, he was accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ragodon</span> and Abraham
Mariano who did not take part in the altercation but merely saw to it that the
companions of <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> would not be able to help the
latter.</p>

and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
guilty of murder for the death of Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> and in
imposing upon them the cor­responding penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the evidence presented in this case, we will take the
appeal of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> '<span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The finding of the trial court on the guilt of this appellant was based
on his identification by the prosecution witnesses as one of the assailants of
the deceased, Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Almares</span> positively named him as the person who gave the
signal to hidden companions, which signal was followed by the
"raining" of stones on him and the deceased; that he was one of the
two persons who stabbed Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> as the latter lay
on the ground with hands raised upward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Marcos <span class="SpellE">Nacionales</span> declared having seen this
appellant with bolo in hand standing near the fallen body of a person<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and heard him daring any sympathizer of <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> to come
out that when he and his family went down their house to go to the house of
barrio lieutenant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Comia</span>, it was this ap­pellant
who accosted them and inquired if they were enemies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Arenas
and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Comia</span> also testified having seen appellant <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span>, with his five co-accused, in the vicinity of
the crime immediately before and after the slaying incident took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the defense presented testimonial evidence and a
police blotter (Exhibit 1) to prove that on the night of the killing appellant
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> and his son, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>,
were inside the <span class="SpellE">Sipocot</span> municipal jail, and that
somebody else committed the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
disregarding such evidence for the accused and giving credence to the version
of the prosecution instead, the trial court duly considered the facts that the
entries in the police blotter, Exhibit 1, were not duly accomplished,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
thus making them unreliable; that with the admission of <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
and the rebuttal evidence of the prosecution, the defense theory that the crime
was committed by said witness (<span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>) was totally
discredited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the
prosecution witnesses were observed by the trial court to have testified in a
natural and straightforward manner, indicating that they could be telling the
truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, it is claimed for appellant Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> that the prosecution witnesses testified the
way they did because of personal grudges against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that witness <span class="SpellE">Almares</span> suspected <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> of
having informed the Philippine Constabulary on the former about a carbine,
which information resulted in the confiscation of the weapon by the
authorities; that witness <span class="SpellE">Nacionales</span> begrudged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tationghari's</span>
refusal to allow his son, <span class="SpellE">Am­brosio</span>, to be married to
a niece of said witness; that <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> Arenas was
under the influence and dictation of Mariano de Torres, who was confined in the
PC stockade in 1952 for <span class="SpellE">Huk</span> activities, upon
information furnished by <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span>; and that
witness Pedro <span class="SpellE">Comia</span> was one of the group that
petitioned for the transfer of certain teachers from the barrio school, which
petition was opposed by <span class="SpellE">Tat­longhari</span>, then barrio
lieutenant and president of the Parent Teachers Association.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the allegation not worthy of belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons for the alleged individual
grudges of the witnesses against appellant being so flimsy and un­certain, it
is incredible that they could constitute as sufficient motive for an average
individual to conjure up so serious a charge as murder and thereby send an
otherwise innocent man to a long stretch of prison term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the prosecution witnesses were
subjected to cross-examination by counsel for the defense, and the falsity of
their declarations, if indeed there were, could have been ferreted out and
exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is, the trial judge even
found the declara­tions of said witnesses more credible and rang of truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is the defense helped by the testimonies of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, Gregorio Cantor
and Mariano Pact that the crime was committed by <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
and two others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the Contrary, the
establishment of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> was confined
in the Manila City Jail on <st1:date year="1954" day="25" month="8">25 August
 1954</st1:date> and, therefore, could not have been in <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span> slashing Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> to
death with a bolo, worked only to weaken further the, <u>alibi</u> of the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in the case being hinged on the credibility of
witnesses, the ruling of the court below must be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, in the absence of proof that there has
been <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span> of evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
- and there is no such proof in this case - the conclusion of the trial judge,
who had the opportunity of observing the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses
while testifying, deserves the respect of the reviewing tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <u>officio</u> for appellant Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> advances the argument that, if at all, the
latter should only be found guilty of homicide, the prosecution allegedly
having failed to prove that treachery, <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and
abuse of superior strength attended the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed that there was no treachery,
because when <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> to his "boys" to get ready Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> was already sufficiently warned of the impending attack
on him; there was also no showing that the accused purposely sought night­time
for the commission of the crime, and that they took undue advantage of superior
strength.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the attack on the victim was
preceded by a cry or signal from this appellant does not make such attack less
treacherous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that
the utterance was not directed to the deceased and his companion, who were then
walking along the railroad track apparently unaware of the danger lying before
them; and the falling of stones that followed and the attack on <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> happened in such close succession that it is safe to
conclude that the latter must have been completely taken by surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, an assault made so suddenly and
on a victim that lay on the ground, and who could do nothing more than raise
his two arms upward perhaps in the futile attempt to cover himself against the
blows of his assail­ants, can not be anything but an attack on a totally
defenseless person and characterized by treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the circumstances of nighttime and abuse of superior
strength were not considered by the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, notwithstanding the finding of the
presence of the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the penalty was only
imposed in its medium period - life imprisonment - denoting the absence of any
circumstance mitigating or aggravating the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regard the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Mercado,
<span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> Mercado, Ambrosia <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span>, the issue
involved again depended on credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented the declarations of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Almares</span>, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Nacionales</span>, Fortunate <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>, and
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Comia</span> to prove that herein appellants were with
accused Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lalogo</span> on the occasion Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span>
was slain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its part, the defense
tried to establish that, on the night in question, appellants were in some
place other than Port Junction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, giving due weight to the evidence for the
prosecution, held that appellants <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Mercado, <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> Mercado, and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span> were with the other accused when the crime took
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no plausible reason for
us to set aside this ruling, not only because it is es­sentially a resolution
on the credibility of witnesses, the correctness of which we have already
upheld, but also because of the well-recognized rule that <u>alibi</u>, the
weakest of defenses, can not prevail over the positive identification of the
accused by witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only point to be considered then is, conceding that herein
appellants were in the group of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> on
the night when Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> was waylaid and slain,
whether or not the trial court was correct in holding them equally guilty of
murder and in sentencing them to life imprisonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, nobody saw <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Mercado, <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> Mercado, and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span> deliver blows to the deceased, or perform some other
act directly linked to the cause of death of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that the record shows is that these
appellants were with Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lalogo</span> shortly before,
during, and after the killing of Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span>, and that
they hurled stones at the latter and his companion, without further ag­gression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When and where these appellants met the
actual killers prior to the crime, or what was agreed upon with them, does not
appear. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>No evidence exists that they
were armed on the occasion, or that these appellants had adequate reason to
wish the deceased out of the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
this paucity of established facts, we do not feel justified in concluding that
these accused previously conspired and concerted with the slayers to take the
life of Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> in the absence of clear proof that
the killing was in fact envisaged by them, they can not be held responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> as co-conspirators, there having been no
satisfactory showing that the killing was done in furtherance of the conspiracy
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Basisten</span>, 47 Phil. 493; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cerdenia</span>, 51 Phil. 393; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Garillo</span>
85 Phil. 634; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Daligdig</span>, 89 Phil.614).</p>

<p class="BODY">The record is clear, however, that, although they had not acted
pursuant to previous concert, the appellants, <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>
Mercado, his son, <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span>, did knowingly aid the actual killers by casting
stones at the victim, and distracting his attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, their cooperation, although done
with knowledge of the criminal intent, was not indispensable to the murderous
assault by Santiago <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> and the fugitive <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lalogo</span>, for which reason
the four should be held liable only as accomplices in the murder of the late
Victor <span class="SpellE">Eje</span> and sentenced to a penalty one degree
lower to that of the principal participants in the crime (except in the case of
<span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> whose
appeal has been previously dismissed for failure to file his brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ubiña</span>,
et al., 97 Phil. 515, 534, this Court ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“ - - - - - - - - - - The act of Romero <span class="SpellE">Pagulayan</span>
in following the deceased <span class="SpellE">Carag</span> as the latter went to
<span class="SpellE">Bañgag</span>, and thus assuring the conspirators of his
presence at said place, is also merely an act of complicity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did they in any manner Induce the
commission of the offense they joined the conspirators after the latter had
decided to commit the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, they do not fall under any of the three concepts defined in
Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code, and may only be considered guilty as
accomplices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same conclusion is
strengthened by the principle that when doubt exists as to whether persons
acted as principals or accomplices, the doubt must be resolved in their favor
and they should be held guilty only as accomplices (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, 44 Phil. 38; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bantagan</span>,
54 Phil. 834)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the basic decision of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>,
44 Phil. 38, this Court, after an exhaustive review of the authorities, laid
down the principle in the following words (<span class="SpellE">cas</span>. cit.
pages 52 and 53):</p>

<blockquote>"But while the authorities above collated con­clusively show
that a man cannot be an accomplice in a crime without participating in the
criminal design of the principal, something remains to be said about the acts
from which such participation in the criminal design can be proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon this point it is undoubtedly true that
concert of action at the moment of consummating the homicide, and the form and
manner in which assistance is rendered, may determine complicity where it would
not be other wise evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a
decision of <st1:date year="1884" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1884</st1:date>,
the case was that after two individuals had beaten another and thrown him to
the ground, the accused got upon him, trampling his breast and face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of the injuries received
from the beating by the first two, the injured person died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held by the supreme court of Spain
that the accused was guilty in the charac­ter of accomplice, saying: Although
the accused did not intervene in giving the mortal injury caused by the cudgel,
for which reason he is not comprehended in article 13, he simultaneously
trampled upon the deceased who was on the floor; and this simultaneity of acts
contributing to the homicide makes him an accomplice in the same.' (Decision,
Dec. 29, 1884; <span class="SpellE">Viada</span>, vol. 1, page 375.)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After analysis of other decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court,
this Court then concluded:</p>

<blockquote>"Now although, as thus demonstrated, participation on the part
of an accomplice in the criminal design of the principal is essential to the
same extent as such participation is neces­sary on the part of one charged as
co-principal, nevertheless, it is evident, -- and the cases above cited
abundantly prove -- ­that, as against an accomplice, a court will sometimes
draw the inference of guilty participation in the criminal design from acts of
concert in the consummation of the criminal act and from the form and manner in
which assistance is rendered, where it would not draw the same inference for
the purpose of holding the same accused in the character of principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because, in case of doubt, the courts
naturally lean to the milder form of responsibility."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the sentence of life imprisonment
meted out to appellants <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tatlonghari</span> is
