Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1963</st1:date>,
Marcelo D. <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> instituted Civil Case No. 2312 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> against <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Laquian</span>, to recover damages
for an alleged defamatory letter written by the latter on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1964" day="19" month="5">May 19,
 1964</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> filed with the Municipal
Court of San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, a criminal
complaint, docketed as Criminal Case No. 4216 of said municipal court, accusing
<span class="SpellE">Laquian</span> of the crime of libel, by reason of the same
alleged defamatory letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="4">April 26, <span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span class="SpellE">Laquian</span><span style=""> </span>moved <span style="">to di</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">miss this complaint upon the ground that the
municipal </span>court <span style="">has no
jurisdiction over the same, in view of the provisions of par. 3 of Art. 360 of
the Revised Penal Code, </span>as <span style="">amended
by Rep. Act No. 1289, pursuant to which "exclusive" </span>jurisdiction
over said <span style="">complaint is vested in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in which the
aforementioned civil case No. 2312 had been filed and is pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon this motion, and <span style="">the opposition </span>thereto filed by the
prosecution, said <span style="">municipal court, </span>presided
over by municipal Judge Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, <span style="">denied the motion </span>in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="5"><span style="">May 27,
 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>reconsideration
of this order was, also, denied, on August 4, 1965, in view of which, on August
27, 1965, <span class="SpellE">Laquian</span> commenced, in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, the present special civil
action for certiorari, which was docketed as Civil Case No. <span style="">2834 of </span>said Court, against said Judge
<span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Regidor</span> <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>, as provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
as well as Marcelo D. <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span>, for the annulment of
said orders of May 27 and August 4, 1965, and a declaration that said municipal
court has no jurisdiction to hear and decide the aforesaid criminal case for
libel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By an order dated May 18, 1966,
the Court of First Instance, however, denied </span>the <span style="">petition </span><span style="">for certiorari
and dismissed said civil case No. 2834, <span style="">upon
</span>the ground that the municipal court has concurrent jurisdiction with the
court of first instance over cases of libel, and, hence, <span style="">over said criminal case </span>No. 4216.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>reconsideration
of this order of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="5"><span style="">May 18, <span style="">1966</span></span></st1:date><span style="">, having been </span><span style="">denied, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Laquian</span> interposed the
present ap­<span style="">peal, </span>which We find
to be well taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As amended by Rep. Act No. 1289, approved on <st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1955</st1:date>, the third paragraph of Art. 360 of
the Revised Penal Code provides that "(t)he criminal and civil action for
damages in cases of written defamations x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall be filed simultaneously or separately with the <u>court
of first instance</u> of the province or city where any of the accused or any
of the offended parties resides at the time of the commission of the
offense"; that "the civil action shall be filed in the <u>same court </u>where
the criminal action is filed <u>and</u> vice-versa";<span style=""> and "(t)hat <u>the court where the
criminal action or civil action for damages is <span style="">first </span>filed, shall acquire jurisdiction to the exclusion of other
courts.</u>" Pursuant to this Art. 360, the court of first instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, in which civil case No. 2312 was filed on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="5"><span style="">May 16,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, had acquired <u>exclusive</u>
jurisdiction to entertain the corresponding criminal action for libel against <span class="SpellE">Laquian</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This notwithstanding, municipal Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
and the court of first instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> were of
the opinion that the criminal complaint for said offense, filed on May 19,
1964, was then within the concurrent jurisdiction of said municipal court and
the court of first instance because libel is, pursuant to Article 355 <span style="">of the Revised </span>Penal Code, punishable
with <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its minimum and medium periods or a fine ranging from 200 to <span style="">6,000 pesos, </span>or both, in addition to
the civil action which may be brought by the offended party, and Sec. 87(c) of
R.A. No. 296 (the Judiciary Act of 1948), as amended by Rep. Act No. 3828,
approved and effective on June 22, 1963, reads partly:</p>

<blockquote>"x<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Justices of the peace in the capitals of provinces, and
sub-provinces and judges of municipal courts shall have like jurisdiction as
the Court of First Instance <span style="">to </span>try
parties charged with an offense committed within their respective
jurisdictions, in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
<span style="">or </span>imprisonment for not more
than <span style="">six </span>years or fine <span style="">not </span>exceeding six thousand pesos or
both, and in the absence of the district judge, shall have like jurisdiction
within <span style="">the province </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the Court of First Instance to hear applications
for bail."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the lower courts have virtually held that Rep. Act No. 1289
has been amended by Rep. Act No. 3828.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This conclusion is, to our mind, untenable, for the following reasons,
namely:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act allocates <u>jurisdic­tion</u>,
in general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
although using the term "jurisdiction," Art. 360 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 1289, refers, mainly, to the <u>place</u>
where actions for libel shall be filed, or "venue," inasmuch <span style="">as, </span>before the <span style="">pas­</span>sage of said amendatory act, courts of first instance already
had <span style="">jurisdiction over </span>criminal
cases for libel.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Even, </span>however, if <span style="">Rep. </span>Act No. 1289 did regulate
jurisdiction, it refers exclusively to that relating to civil and criminal
actions for <u>written defama­tion</u>, and it is well settled that a general
law does not repeal or modify a previous special law on a specific subject
included in the general law, unless the intent is manifest.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
No such intent appears in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, in the language of People v. <span class="SpellE">Olarte</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>under
said Article 360, as originally enacted, an offended party residing, let us
say, in the province of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, could - for the
purpose of causing undue harass<span style="">ment -
commence, in the province of <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span>, a civil </span><span style="">action against the publisher of a newspaper
edited in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, said
offended party could institute a criminal action in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>To
avoid these evils, Article 360 was amended by Republic Act No. 1289.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></u>Pursuant thereto, <u>both</u> actions <u>must</u>
be filed with the <u>same</u> court of first instance, and this must be that of
'the province or city where any of the accused or any of the offended parties <u>resides</u>
at the time of the commission of the offense,' unless 'the libel is published,
circulated, displayed or exhibited in the province or city wherein neither the
offender nor the offended resides,' in which case 'the civil and criminal
actions may be brought in the court of first instance thereof.' That <u>these
were the only objectives</u> of Congress in passing House Bill No. 2695, which
later became Republic Act No. 1289, is manifest, not only from the above quoted
explanatory note to said bill, but, also, from the Congressional Record
pertinent thereto.</span><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is absolutely nothing in Rep. Act 3828 to indicate that
Congress wanted to abrogate or modify the foregoing policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Even in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, it is, also,
axiomatic that the court first acquiring jurisdiction excludes the other
courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, upon the filing of civil case No. 2312 of the court of
first instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, <u>on May 16, 1963, that
court acquired,</u> pursuant to said Art. 360 of the Revised Penal Code, as
amended, <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction over the criminal action that may
subsequently be filed in consequence of the same written defamation on which
said civil case No. 2312 was based.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, again, there is no clear expression of the will of Congress, in
Rep. Act No. 3828, to divest said court of first instance of the exclusive
jurisdiction, vested in it prior thereto, over said criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. There is every reason to believe that Congress had no such
design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Rep. Act No. 4363,
approved on June 19, 1965, which further amended said Art. 360 of the Revised
Penal Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>reproduced</u> the provisions of said Art. 360, as amended by Rep. Act <span style="">No. 1289, to the effect that "(t)he
criminal and civil action for damages in cases of written defamations x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall be filed </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span style="">with the </span><u>court
of first instance</u> of the <span style="">province
or </span>city where the libelous<span style=""> </span>article
is printed and first published or where any of the offended parties actually
resides at the time of the commission of the <span style="">offense"; that "the civil action
shall </span><span style="">be
</span><span style="">filed
in the <u>same </u></span><u><span style="">court</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">where the criminal action is filed and <u>vice</u> <u>versa</u>"
and that "the court </span><span style="">where
the criminal action </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">civil action for
damages is </span><span style="">fir</span><span style="">st</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">filed, shall acquire jurisdiction to the </span><u>exclusion</u>
<span style="">of other </span><span style="">courts."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
</span>is, therefore, our considered opinion that the municipal court of San
Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, has no jurisdiction to hear and
decide the aforementioned criminal case No. 4216; that <span style="">respondent </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
has erred in denying <span class="SpellE">Laquian's</span> motion to dismiss said
case; and that the order of the court of first instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
denying the petition for certiorari in civil case No. 2834 of <span style="">said </span><span style="">court </span>and
dismissing the same should be, as it is hereby reversed, with costs against
private respondent Marcelo D. <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span>.</p>
