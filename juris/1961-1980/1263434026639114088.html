<p class="BODY">In a complaint filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1975</st1:date> before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>,
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span>
(private respondent herein) instituted an action for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span>
against defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>

<span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> (private respondents herein), in order to
determine the owner to whom he should make payments of the rents of the parcel
of land that he is occupying as a lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleges among others, that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span> has been renting
since 1951, a portion of a large parcel of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Gabao</span>,

to defendant <span class="SpellE">Joaquina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, by virtue of a Verbal
lease contract; that he built thereon a house in the same year and has been
paying yearly rentals to defendant <span class="SpellE">Joaquina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>; that there are
other lessees occupying the other portions of the said parcel of land, who have
likewise been paying yearly rentals; that sometime in 1971, defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> asserted
ownership over a parcel of land with an area of 154 square meters covered by
Tax Declaration No. 16696 in the name of Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>;
that this parcel of land is only a portion of the large parcel of land owned by
defendant <span class="SpellE">Joaquina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> and on which portion plaintiff and another lessee,
Ester <span class="SpellE">Grefaldeo</span>, had built their house; that
plaintiff is being harassed, threatened, and forced by defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> to vacate the
lot that he is occupying; that also sometime in 1971, defendant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> asserted ownership over the entire parcel of land
of defendant <span class="SpellE">Joaquina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, including the portion which plaintiff had
been occupying; that defendant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> also
resorted to ways and means to oust plaintiff and the other occupants from the
property of defendant <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>; that there are now
three parties claiming ownership over one and the same property; and that these
parties should be ordered to interplead with each other and litigate their
respective claims of ownership over the property, a portion of which is being
rented by the plaintiff (pp. 1-8, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding summonses, together with the complaint for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> and the order to interplead issued by the
lower court on <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1975</st1:date>,
were served upon defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="9">September

<p class="BODY">By order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="1">January 6,
 1976</st1:date>, the lower court denied the motion to dismiss filed by
defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and
defendant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">ROA</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
denial was received on <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="1">January 16,

for defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of defendant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span>, the records do not show when his counsel, Atty.
Archimedes <span class="SpellE">Frivaldo</span>, actually received the order of
denial which was sent by registered mail on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 9, 1976, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span>, through his counsel, Atty. Jaime G. Fortes, filed
a motion to declare defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> in
default, upon the ground that the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
for the filing of an answer to the complaint had already expired without any
answer having been filed within said period (pp. 17-19, <span class="SpellE">ROA</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the date set for the hearing of the motion on <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1976</st1:date>, defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> filed a motion
for postponement so they could file an opposition to the plaintiff’s motion,
which motion the court granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <u>on February 20, 1976, defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span></u>, through their counsel, <u>filed an opposition
to the motion to declare them in default and attached thereto the answer to the
complaint with a petition to admit said answer</u> (pp. 19-21, <span class="SpellE">ROA</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
answer, which was supported by an affidavit of merits, they alleged that they
are claiming ownership over a parcel of land with an area of 154 square meters
covered by Tax Declaration No. 16696, which they inherited from their late
father, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>; that their father sold to
the <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> family two parcels of land under Tax
Declaration No. 16695 and Tax Declaration No. 12097; that in the consolidation
of the latter two parcels of land sold to them, the <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
family erroneously consolidated the parcel of land claimed by the defendants
under Tax Declaration No. 16696 with the parcel of land under Tax Declaration
No. 16695, instead of the parcel of land under Tax Declaration No. 12097; that
the parcel of land under Tax Declaration No. 16696 is presently occupied by
defendant <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>,
but a portion of said lot is being occupied by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span> where he had built his house; and that
defendants have no interest in the lots covered by Tax Declarations Nos. 16695
and 12097 (pp. 21-27, <span class="SpellE">ROA</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1976</st1:date>,
the respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Aquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span>
issued an order declaring defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> in default, the <span class="SpellE">dis­positive</span>

stating the facts constituting their failure to answer on time and the good and
meritorious defenses they rely upon to controvert the complaint (Annex D,

respondent Judge issued an order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="5">May

neglect.</blockquote>

of merit" Annex <span class="GramE">A</span>, Petition, p. 16, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>

<st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1976</st1:date>, defendants

<st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1976</st1:date> (pp. 39-42, <span class="SpellE">ROA</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, through

petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;

 1978</st1:date> a motion for extension of time of fifteen (15) days within
which to file their petition, which the Court granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1978</st1:date> (pp. 10-28, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Required to comment on the

Archimedes <span class="SpellE">Frivaldo</span>, counsel for defendant Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Revilla</span> (private respondent herein), failed to file their

</span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1978</st1:date>,
the Court required Attys. Jaime G. Fortes and Archimedes <span class="SpellE">Frivaldo</span>

</span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1979</st1:date>,
Atty. Fortes filed a motion for reconsideration of the resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1979</st1:date>, and the comment on the
petition (pp. 47-52, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In OUR
resolution of April 6, 1979, the Court resolved to reduce the fine imposed on
Atty. Fortes to one hundred pesos (P100.00) and resolved further to give due course
to the petition and declared the case submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue to be determined in the instant case is whether or
not the respondent Judge abused his discretion in declaring the defendants
(petitioners herein) in default and in refusing to set aside the order of
default.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is OUR view that the failure of defendants’ counsel, Atty.
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Frivaldo</span>, to file an answer on time and his
being able to do so only after the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, considering the attendant circumstances in this case, is excusable and
do not warrant the declaration of default of defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">For one, defendants’ counsel failed to file the answer on time
because he overlooked the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period and he attributed this oversight or negligence to the following
factors:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, his advanced age (77
years); second, he is suffering from high blood pressure and was hospitalized
for cerebral stroke in 1972, which made him prone to forget dates or events
that happened earlier; third, pressure of work; fourth, lack of personnel; and
lastly, the length of time from the filing of the motion to dismiss the
complaint for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> and its resolution by the
lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously mentioned,
the complaint in the present case, together with the summons and the order to
interplead, was served upon defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> on September 25, 1975, then on October 7, 1975, or
three (3) days before the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period for the filing of an answer, defendants moved to dismiss the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was, however,
denied by the lower court on <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="1">January 6,
 1976</st1:date>, and copy of the order of denial was received on <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1976</st1:date> by defendants'
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the motion to
dismiss was resolved by the lower court only after three (3) months from the
filing of said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering this
fact, together with the other factors aforesaid, it would not have been
impossible or unusual for defendants' counsel to have overlooked the expiration
of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, defendants’ counsel overlooked the fact
that he had still three (3) days left from <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1976</st1:date>, or up to <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1976</st1:date>, within which to file an answer to the
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, WE consider the fact that when plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span> filed on
February 9, 1976 a motion to declare defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> in default, and before they were declared in
default, defendants' counsel, realizing that the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period had already expired, diligently prepared and immediately filed on
February 20, 1976 an opposition to the motion and attached thereto the answer
to the complaint with a petition to admit the same, a proof of his intention to
comply with the rules of procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
circumstance excludes also the intention to unduly delay the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be added also that the late filing
of the answer did not in any way prejudice the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span>
who as lessee is not claiming ownership over the land nor deprive him of any
substantial right or interest, considering that his complaint was only an
action for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span> against several persons
asserting ownership over said land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, when the defendants were declared in default on <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1976</st1:date> and they received a
copy of the order of default on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="3">March
 10, 1976</st1:date>, they immediately applied for relief within a reasonable
time by filing a motion to lift the order of default on <st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Most importantly, the record shows that defendants <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> and <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> have a good and
valid defense in plaintiff’s action for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants are claiming ownership over a
parcel of land with an area of 154 square meters under Tax Declaration No.
16696 which they inherited from their late father, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
parcel of land forms part of the large parcel of land owned by defendant
Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, and on which parcel plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliquino</span> had built his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the late Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> sold to the <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
family two (2) parcels of land under Tax Declarations Nos. 16695 and
12097.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the consolidation of these two
lots, the <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> family erroneously consolidated
with the parcel under Tax Declaration No. 16695 the parcel of land under Tax
Declaration No. 16696, instead of the parcel of land under Tax Declaration No.
12097.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, defendants have an
interest in the parcel of land under Tax Declaration No. 16696 and their
presence is indispensable in order that they may protect such interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should be given a day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has always opted for a liberal interpretation of the
rules of procedure whenever procedural technicalities are involved in a
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a case analogous to the
case at bar, the Court, adopting a liberal posture, considered as excusable the
failure of the public counsel to incorporate in the notice of appeal the
material dates showing the timeliness of the appeal where such omission was due
to his "mistake, inadvertence and negligence considering the given circumstances
of confusion caused by heavy pressure of work aggravated by lack of personnel
and equipment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (<span class="SpellE">Canturna</span> vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 70 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 563 [1976]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Cusio</span> vs. Court of
Appeals, et al. (57 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 64 [1974]), the counsel for
the petitioner asked for a third and last extension of time to file his
appellants brief and cited in support of his motion his advanced age (67
years), his recurrent attacks of arthritis, the distance of 150 kilometers he
had to travel from his office in <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span> to Manila for
the preparation of his brief and the pressure of other professional work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court denied petitioner's
urgent motion as well as his motion for reconsideration and ordered the
dismissal of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court set
aside the appellate court's resolutions denying the third and last extension of
time and the motion for reconsideration, and gave due course to the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In another case, WE considered as excusable negligence the
failure of the defendant's lawyer to file an answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period because his wife underwent a Caesarian
operation and subsequently got sick, and said lawyer had to attend to her
personally and it does not appear that he had partners in his law office (<span class="SpellE">Eduque</span> vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 10 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
632 [1964]).</p>

<p class="BODY">And in a 1909 case, the failure of the provincial fiscal to file
his answer within the time prescribed by law due to the many urgent demands on
his time and attention in the performance of his <span class="GramE">duties,</span>
was like­wise considered excusable negligence (<span class="SpellE">Siquenza</span>
vs. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span>, 14 Phil. 495 [1909]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the respondent Judge, in declaring the
defendants in default, applied the rules of procedure strictly, disregarding
the liberal stance that WE have always adopted and the mandate under Section 2,
Rule 1 of the Revised Rules of Court that "these rules shall be liberally
construed in order to promote their object and to assist the parties in
obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and
proceeding."</p>

<p class="BODY">WE find no cogent reason in the case at bar to depart from the
rule on the liberal interpretation of the rules of procedure and to adhere to
the technical rules of procedure strictly, for to do so would not serve the
ends of substantial justice and equity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As said in the recent case of <span class="SpellE">Galdo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> (84 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 238 [1978]), this
Court "frowns upon such application of procedural rules with pedantic
rigor", citing the leading case of Alonso vs. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>
(16 Phil. 315 [1910]) wherein WE stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to
justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant
consideration from courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should
be no vested rights in technicalities."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, in Gregorio vs. Court of Appeals (72 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
120 [1976]), WE said:</p>

<blockquote>"The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very
rigid, technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure, not
override, substantial justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a
technical and rigid enforcement of the rules is made, their aim would be
defeated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And WE stressed in the case of Lim <span class="SpellE">Tanhu</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span> (66 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 425
[1975]) that:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> the rules of procedure may not
be misused and abused as instruments for the denial of substantial
justice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, respondent Judge should not have been unduly strict in
applying the rules of procedure and should have avoided such a precipitate
action declaring the defendants in default because judgments by defaults are
never looked upon with favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has already declared "its disapproval of default
judgments and cautioned the courts to be more circumspect before declaring a
defendant in default" (Luis Peggy, et al., vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tapuan</span>, et al., L-45270, February 28, 1979; <span class="SpellE">Corsino</span>, et al. vs. Hon. Arnold <span class="SpellE">Savella</span>,
et al., L-38367, November 24, 1978).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the earlier case of Heirs of Jose Fuentes vs. <span class="SpellE">Macandog</span> (83 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 648 [1978]), WE
said:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Default is not a mechanical gadget for the acceleration of
judicial litigations</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The laudable
intention of respondent judge to terminate the subject case promptly is no
excuse for cutting corners that the rules have fixed to insure that the
constitutional requirement of due process is observed and safeguarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The expeditious dispatch of court matters
does not have to be gained by causing unnecessary inconvenience to any of the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>Whether or not to declare a defendant in default
requires mature consideration of all attendant circumstances, a sound
discretion and a great deal of circumspection</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court is not supposed to grab the first
opportunity, no matter how insubstantially grounded, to knock the defendant out
of court" (underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And in the landmark case of Coombs vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
(24 Phil. 446 [1913]), WE stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"A default judgment does not pretend to be based upon the
merits of the controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its existence
is justified on the ground that it is the one final expedient to induce the
defendant to join issues upon the allegations tendered by the plaintiff, and to
do so without unnecessary delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A
judgment by default may amount to a positive and considerable injustice to the
defendant; and the possibility of such serious consequences necessitates a
careful examination of the grounds upon which the defendant asks that it be set
aside</u>" (underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, respondent judge should have been more liberal in the
exercise of his discretion by setting aside the order of default especially so
because the defendants filed their answer together with their opposition to the
motion to declare them in default, and, after having been declared in default,
immediately filed a motion to set aside the order of default within a
reasonable time.</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> when the
motion to set aside the order of default was made without any loss of time and
before a date was set for the hearing of the case on its merits, and is
accompanied by a sworn statement of merit and copies of documents which
constitute prima facie a just and valid defense, such failure is insufficient
to deprive a defendant of his rights, as in the present case, and the refusal
to set aside the order of default constitutes an abuse of discretion, and
especially when such setting aside of the order of default will in no way
prejudice the plaintiff" (<span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> vs. Cruz, 80 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 712 [1977]; <span class="SpellE">Tumambing</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ganzon</span>, 18 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 411 [1966]; <span class="SpellE">Bañares</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gavito</span>, 51 Phil. 786 [1928]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And furthermore, this Court, in the case of Heirs of Jose Fuentes
vs. <span class="SpellE">Macandog</span> (<u>supra</u>), citing the case of
Pineda vs. Court of Appeals (67 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 228 [1975]),
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"WE maintain fealty to the principle that courts should be
liberal in setting aside orders of default, for default judgment is frowned
upon, and unless it clearly appears that the reopening of the case is intended
for delay, it is best that trial courts give both parties every chance to fight
their case fairly and in the open, without resort to technicality."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In conclusion, considering that the late filing of defendants'
answer was due to excusable negligence and that they appear to have a
meritorious defense; that defendants filed an answer before they were declared
in default; and that the late filing of the answer did not in any way prejudice
or deprive the plaintiff of any substantial right, nor was there intention to
unduly delay the case, WE hold that the respondent judge committed an abuse of
discretion in declaring the defendants in default and in refusing to set aside
the order of default.</p>
