				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 29, 1954, plaintiff Miguel de los Santos filed with the CFI of 
Manila, a complaint, which was amended on November 17, 1954, seeking to recover 
from his former employer Dr. Francisco Quisumbing, defendant, the amount of 
P11,221.08 plus legal interest, representing the value of his overtime service, 
as a taximeter mechanic. Plaintiff alleged that during the whole period of his 
employment for defendant, he worked every day, including Sundays and Holidays, 
from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and again from 1:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., working a 
total of 12 hours, or 4 hours daily in excess of that provided by Commonwealth 
Act No. 444 and that at the rate of an agreed P380.00 monthly salary, the sum of 
P11,221.08, may be tabulated as follows:

<p>Defendant, answering the complaint, alleged that he never asked plaintiff to 
render overtime service, nor consented to such overtime work expressly or 
impliedly; that plaintiff had been fully paid for his services; that the service 
of plaintiff being one rendered to a public service, Commonwealth Act No. 444, 
is not applicable to his claim for overtime work, much less to his charge for 
"time and one-fourth (1Â¼)" and that certain claims of plaintiff are barred by 
prescription. A counterclaim for damages, expenses for litigation and attorneys 
fees, amounting to P1,000.00 was set up.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1956, the trial court handed down a decision, ordering the 
defendant to pay to plaintiff the amount of P2,000.00, with legal interest 
thereon, from the filing of the complaint until fully paid, and the costs. 
Defendant's counterclaim was dismissed.</p>
<p>On September 29, 1956, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging 
that (<em>a</em>) said decision is contrary to law and established 
jurisprudence; (<em>b</em>) the plaintiff failed to prove by indubitable and 
competent evidence his claim for overtime compensation; (<em>c</em>) the 
plaintiff's cause of action has already prescribed; and (<em>d</em>) the trial 
court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. The motion was 
denied on October 11, 1956. Forthwith, defendant appealed to the Court of 
Appeals.</p>
<p>In defendant's brief, he alleged that the trial court erred (1) in holding 
that plaintiff rendered compensable overtime to defendant and in condemning him 
to pay plaintiff the amount of P2,000.00 plus interest and in not dismissing 
plaintiff's complaint. The bulk of the argument in appellant's brief dwelt on 
the proposition that plaintiff's evidence failed to show satisfactorily the 
facts upon which he based his claim for compensation for overtime work; that 
while plaintiff asserted he had worked overtime for so many days, the defendant 
said he did not; that while the plaintiff alleged that his witnesses were more 
credible, the defendant contended that said witnesses could not be believed and 
that his evidence preponderated. However, because the question of jurisdiction 
was raised, the Court of Appeals did not pass upon the merits of the case and 
certified the same to Us, declaring that under the authority of Administration 
of Hacienda Luisita Estate <em>vs</em>. Alberto, G. R. No. L-12133, Oct. 31, 
1958; National Shipyard &amp; Steel Corp. <em>vs</em>. Almin, et al., 104 Phil., 
835; 56 Off. Gaz., (9) 1899, and other 1958 cases, it had no jurisdiction to 
entertain the appeal of cases seeking to recover compensation for overtime 
services. In other words, the case at bar, involving as it does, hours of 
employment under Comm. Act No. 444, and pursuant to the authorities cited, the 
trial court acquired no jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p>The rulings in said cases, however, were explained in subsequent cases. Thus, 
in the case of NASSCO <em>vs</em>. CIR, (107 Phil., 1006; 58 Off. Gaz., [36] 
5875), we have stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. If the claimants were not actual employees of the NASSCO, 
<em>e.g.</em> they have severed their connection with it or were dismissed, but 
do not insist on reinstatement, their claim for overtime compensation would 
become simply a monetary demand properly cognizable by the regular 
courts".</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Price Stabilization Corp. <em>vs</em>. CIR, etc. (108 Phil., 
134), it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Analyzing these cases, the underlying principle, it will be noted in all of 
them, though not stated in express terms, is that where the employer-employee 
relationship is still existing or is sought to be reestablished because of its 
wrongful severance (as where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of 
Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or in 
connection with the employment, such as those related to the Minimum Wage Law 
and the Eight-Hour Labor Law. After the termination of the relationship and no 
reinstatement is sought, such claims become mere money claims, and come within 
the jurisdiction of the regular courts.</p>
<p>We are aware that in 2 cases, some statements, implying a different view have 
been made, but we now hold and declare the principle set forth in the next 
preceding paragraph as the one governing all cases of this 
nature."</p></blockquote>
<p>The records show that the plaintiff-appellee was no longer connected with or 
employed in the ''Dollar Taxi" of which the defendant-appellant was the 
operator, at the time the complaint was filed and that no insinuation or prayer 
was ever made for plaintiff-appellee's reinstatement in the pleadings. The trial 
court, therefore, acquired jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case, and the 
issues raised in the appeal being dominantly factual, the case is hereby 
returned to the Court of Appeals for determination of the merits of the 
appeal.</p><em>Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., De
