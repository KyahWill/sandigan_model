Manila, Branch XVIII, in Criminal Case No. 69139, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Premises considered, the Court acquits defendant Oscar
Padilla, with costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> and his immediate
release is hereby ordered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect
to defendants Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar, the Court finds and so holds that their
guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the commission of the crime, the
aggravating circumstances of use of motor vehicle and nighttime were attendant,
without any mitigating circumstance to offset any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court also considers against the said
defendants that the crime of direct assault against an agent of a person of
authority was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this
Court is adverse at imposing the capital punishment, nevertheless, in view of
the <span style="">cir</span>cumstances of the case
and the express and mandatory provisions of the second paragraph of Article 5
of the Revised Penal Code, the Court finds itself compelled to comply with the
law and imposes <span style="">upon each of them the
maximum penalty prescribed by law - death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are also sentenced to indemnify jointly and severally, the
government in the sum of P23,778 and the heirs of the deceased Pat. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Daracan</span> in the amount of P5,000.00, and to pay the
costs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> y <span class="SpellE">Ortacio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar y <span class="SpellE">Dayao</span>, Oscar Padilla and <span class="SpellE">Lagim</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagunera</span>, together with others still unidentified, were
charged with the crime of Robbery in Band with Homicide, according to the
Information, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 28th day of February, 1963, at nighttime
which was purposely sought to better accomplish their ends and with the use of
a motor vehicle, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused,
conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one another did then
and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously, with
intent to gain and by means of force, violence and intimidation, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by using a United Taxi with Plate No. 125 <span class="SpellE">Mla</span>. '62 to convey them to their destination and armed with
guns, entered the MVO Branch on Dakota St., <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>,
in said City, and pointing their guns at the employees therein and shooting
Pat. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Daracan</span> y <span class="SpellE">Solayao</span>
with a carbine and .45 caliber pistol, thereby inflicting upon him mortal
wounds which were the direct cause of his death thereafter, take, steal and
carry away cash money in different denominations amounting to P23,778.00 and
several non-negotiable checks of undetermined amount payable to said office, to
the damage and prejudice of the Motor Vehicle Office (Manila Branch) in the
aforesaid sum of P23,778.00, Philippine Currency."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
case against <span class="SpellE">Lagim</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagunera</span>
was dismissed for insufficiency of evidence after the prosecution had closed
its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oscar Padilla was
acquitted by the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 21, 1965, appellant Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>,
through counsel, filed before this Court a Motion for New Trial on the grounds
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) errors of law or
irregularities had been committed during the trial prejudicial to the
substantial rights of the herein appellant; and (2) new and material evidence
had been discovered which the accused could not, with reasonable diligence,
have discovered at the trial, and which if introduced and admitted, would
probably change the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
Minute Resolution dated <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="11">November 2,
 1965</st1:date>, this Court resolved to take up this matter when this case is
considered on its merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the first ground, the motion failed to show any such
error or irregularity that may be the ground for a new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have noted that the arguments contained
therein are not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have been
raised during the hearing and disposed of in the decision of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second ground, the alleged new evidence, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the expected testimony of Romeo
Canary, a fellow convict, exculpating appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>,
is not a ground for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to the decision of the trial court, this appellant was aware of this evidence
but made no effort to produce the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order that this Court, before whom an appeal is pending, may receive
and properly consider new and material evidence, it must be shown that the
evidence was discovered after trial; could not have been discovered and
produced at the trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence; is material and
not merely cumulative, corroborative or impeaching; and is of such weight that
it will probably change the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
A motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence, supported by an
affidavit of a fellow prisoner already convicted of a serious offense
exculpating appellant and assuming with others full responsibility for the
crime, had often been denied as coming from a polluted source and not worthy of
consideration in view of clear evidence of guilt of the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1971</st1:date>,
this Court received from the Bureau of Prisons a certified true copy of the
Certificate of Death of appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar,
showing that said appellant died on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1971</st1:date>, of undetermined cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of the death of the aforesaid appellant during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the automatic review of the judgment of
conviction, his criminal liability, meaning his obligation to serve the
personal or imprisonment penalties, and his liability to pay the fines or
pecuniary penalties, is extinguished.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1963</st1:date>, while Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> was driving
a taxi with Plate No. TX-125, Manila (62) along Felix <span class="SpellE">Huertas</span>,
two men hailed his taxicab near the corner of Gov. Forbes and <span class="SpellE">Laon­-laan</span> Streets and when he stopped, they asked him if
he could take in five passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
an affirmative reply, one of the men beckoned the three other companions and
they approached the cab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the five
boarded the cab, with three passengers at the back, while the other two sat at
the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raul drove his taxicab
through <st1:street><st1:address>Dakota St.</st1:address></st1:street> on instruction
of his passengers who said they were looking for women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the corner of Dakota and Vito
Cruz Streets, the taxi turned left and en<span style="">tered
</span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sagan</span></span><span style=""> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raul
inquired from the group where they were going but one of the passengers
answered that they know where they could find women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raul continued driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the Holiday </span>Motel at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
one of the men at the front seat said they might find some women there but ano­ther
passenger ordered <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> to proceed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the taxicab reached <st1:street><st1:address>Dakota
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Raul was made to turn right and as they
were near the gate of the Motor Vehicles Office one of the passengers poked a
gun at <span class="SpellE">Empedrado's</span> side and told him to stop the car,
which he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>
looked at the man who poked the gun and he identified him at the trial to be
Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, the other passenger at the front seat alighted and
after shoving <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>, he took the wheel and drove
towards the Motor Vehicles Office at <st1:street><st1:address>Dakota Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the place, the car was parked
in the compound at about five (5) meters from the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the passenger who took the wheel
and the other passengers at the back alighted, while <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
kept the gun pointed at <span class="SpellE">Empedrado's</span> head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a lapse of two minutes, during which <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> continued pointing his gun at <span class="SpellE">Empedrado's</span>
forehead, <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> grabbed <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>
by his collar, and using him as a shield, pulled him out of the cab, at the
same time firing his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other shots
followed while <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> pulled <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>
to the counter of the Motor Vehicles Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching the same, <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> suddenly
pushed <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> to one side of the counter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, he heard someone shouted:
"<span class="SpellE"><i>Pasok</i></span><i>,</i><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">dapa</span></span></i><span style="">." </span>While thus lying flat on their bellies, <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> heard several shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the shooting had ceased, Raul got up
and noticed that his taxicab was gone.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution further shows that at the time
the malefactors arrived at the Motor Vehicles Office, <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>, driver-examiner, one Mr. <span class="SpellE">Varona</span> and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>, were
playing chess inside their division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
of a sudden, they heard someone shout: "This is a holdup, do not
move." <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> stood up only to find him
staring at a carbine being pointed at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately after, the man shot the policeman who was then by the main
door about five (5) meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> also saw other persons pointing carbines at the
fallen officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>
immediately crawled under the table and while there he heard someone shout:
"Doming, <span class="SpellE"><i>dali</i></span><i> ka <span class="SpellE">na</span></i>."
While these were taking place, Jose B. Rigor, the Acting Cashier, was called by
his superior and went out of the cashier's cage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While with his superior, they heard a
commotion at the main door about fifteen (15) meters away, and when they looked
up in that direction, they saw a man, with his back towards them, holding a
carbine pointed at the other employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, they heard gun reports.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rigor and his superior then went into the bodega for cover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the other employees had
dropped to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Minerito</span> <span class="SpellE">Giman</span>, who hid under the
Registrar's table, was grabbed by the collar by someone who asked where the
money was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Giman</span>
replied he did not know as they were not in charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man then pushed him inside the cashier's
cage and again asked where the money was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then he saw that the cash register was opened and when he found no money
inside, he ordered <span class="SpellE">Giman</span> to open the drawers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Giman</span> did so and
when he opened the center drawer of the Cashier's table, the man saw that it
contained money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man then ordered <span class="SpellE">Giman</span> to turn around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Giman</span> obeyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly after, the gunman fired two shots to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When silence returned, <span class="SpellE">Giman</span>
turned around but the man was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
saw that the drawer was on the floor, but the money was gone except some bills
that were scattered on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
other shots followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows
that P23,778.00 in cash were taken by the robbers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence also discloses that a mobile patrol notified the
Theft and Robbery Section of the Detective Bureau about the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Detective <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumanog</span>, together with Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>,
proceeded to the Motor Vehicles Office and saw near the main door the body of
the deceased officer, identified as Pat. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Daracan</span>,
riddled with bullets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His service pistol
was missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beside the officer, they
found carbine and .45 caliber pistol empty shells.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about the same time, the Homicide Section
was notified and <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. Jesus <span class="SpellE">Senen</span> responded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They took possession of the sixteen (16) empty shells that were gathered
by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> - ten (10) empty shells of .30
caliber carbine and six (6) shells of .45 caliber pistol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were later turned over to the ballistic
expert for examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shells were found
in the lobby near the office of the Cashier, others were near the main door and
others were near the <span class="SpellE">Trafcon</span> car parked in front of
the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Photographs of the scene of
the crime were taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the police
informants, the police learned that the robbery was committed by known police
characters from <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Search for the suspects was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, during the police
investigation at the scene of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Marcelo, Fingerprint Expert of the Manila Police Department was summoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival thereat, Marcelo found one of
the technicians looking for latent prints, but up to that time, he had not
found any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon Marcelo was summoned to <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
(should be <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span>) Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that the taxi used by the
culprits was found abandoned in front of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Centro</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Escolar</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo examined the taxi for latent prints
and found one on the outside of the door and another one on the inner side of
the windshield (Exhibits "D" and "E").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lifted the latent prints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the back of the car, they found pieces of
rope (Exhibit "B"), a carbine stock (Exhibit "A"), a bullet
(Exhibit "C").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After lifting
the latent fingerprints, Marcelo compared them with the fingerprints on file
with the Detective Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He discovered
that the latent prints lifted from the inner face right side of the windshield
(right glass window) (Exhibit "E-1") tallied with the print of the
middle finger of appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, after the arrest of Aguilar,
Marcelo took the impressions of his fingerprints (Exhibits "F" and
"G"), and com­pared them with the latent fingerprints lifted and
found that the impressions of the right middle finger (Exhibit "F-1")
tallied with the latent prints (Exhibit "E-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo's findings are contained in the
report (Exhibit "J").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the
accused, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar was first apprehended and
brought on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1963</st1:date> to
the office of the Theft and Robbery Section by <span class="SpellE">Campillanes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aguilar was questioned but at first denied
participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on March 6,
1963, <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>
questioned Aguilar and this time, he admitted his participation and gave a
written statement (Exhibit "P"), wherein he identified his companions
during the commission of the crime as <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
(Exhibit "P-3") and Padilla, (Exhibit "P-1"), but both were
not present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of the same
day, Aguilar gave an additional statement (Exhibit "Q"), claiming
among others things that he was about to separate from his companions but
Padilla called him (Exhibit "Q-1").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He identified Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> as the taxi
driver (Exhibit "Q­2"). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
additional statement was sworn to by him before Assistant Fiscal Alfonso
Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days later, upon the
arrest of Padilla, accused Aguilar was confronted with Padilla and he gave
another statement (Exhibit "R"), identifying Oscar Padilla (Exhibit
"R-1").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>, who was picked up on implication by Aguilar, was
likewise questioned and his statement (Exhibit "V") was taken at </span><st1:time minute="50" hour="11"><span style="">11:50 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""> </span><st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted participation and he identified Aguilar as one of his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When shown photographs of Padilla taken from
the files, <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> also identified him (Exhibits
"V-1" and "V-2").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
</span><st1:time minute="0" hour="19"><span style="">7:00
 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""> on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> again executed a statement elaborating the details
of his previous confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
sworn to before the Assistant City Fiscal on the same date (Exhibit
"Z").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="3"><span style="">March 9,
 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> took his additional
statement (Exhibit "S") when he was confronted with Padilla and he
identified the latter (Exhibit "S-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> also
affirmed that before going to the Motor Vehicles Office, he and his companions
met at the <span class="SpellE">Santal</span> Arcade at the cor­ner of <span class="SpellE">Castaños</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span>
Streets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He affirmed under oath the
veracity of his statements before the Assistant City Fiscal on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="3"><span style="">March
 31, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It also appears from the
evidence that on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="3"><span style="">March 3, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Servillano</span> David
made a paraffin test on <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar and
Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>, and on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="3"><span style="">March 9, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, he also made a similar test on Oscar
Padilla.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His findings on the test are
set forth in Exhibit "Y" wherein the dorsal part of the right and
left hands of Aguilar (Exhibits "X-1" and "X-2") and <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> (Exhibits "X-3" and "X-4") are
sketched and blue spots indicating the presence of nitrates marked with letter
"S".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to Padilla, the test
also gave positive reaction and the sketch of the dorsal of </span>his right
hand showing the spot was also made (Exh­ibit "Y-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigating officer submitted the
reports of the investigation (Exhibit "U").</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence further shows that the body of Pat. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Daracan</span> was examined by Dr. Angelo <span class="SpellE">Singian</span>
whose findings are set forth in the Autopsy Report (Exhibit
"K").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to said
report, the victim sustained three (3) gunshot wounds, described in said
Autopsy Report and indicated in the diagram (Exhibit "M"), and the
cause of death was shock and profuse hemorrhage resulting from the gunshot
wounds (Exhibit "L").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> denied any
participation in the commission of the crime and tried to prove that the
robbery was committed by other persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He claimed that he signed Exhibits "S", "V" and
"Z" but without knowing their contents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised by appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the admissibility of his
extrajudicial confessions; and (2) the credibility of Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> contends that his
extrajudicial confessions were given under duress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant claims that the details in his
alleged confessions were supplied by the police from the information gathered
from the taxi driver, Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>, and Motor
Vehicles Office employees <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Varona</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Giman</span>, and that he was forced to sign his declaration after
being tortured.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, however, that the extrajudicial confessions
of appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> (Exhibits "V" and
"Z") described the events relative to the planning of the robbery,
the actual holdup and the flight of the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
stated:</p>

<p class="BODY">Only a participant to the conspiracy could have vividly related
the sequence of events from the commencement of the plan to commit the crime
prior to the group's boarding the taxicab and the perpetration of the crime
itself at the Motor Vehicles Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be said that the source of these details was Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>
because the latter was with the group only from the time they boarded his
taxicab up to the actual holdup at the Motor Vehicles Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be claimed also that they
originated from the Motor Vehicles Office employees because their knowledge of
the robbery was only limited to what transpired at the Motor Vehicles Office
building.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
testified, he claimed that he was given fist and karate blows by the policemen
who investigated him and he was forced to sign the extrajudicial
confessions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied, however,
that when he appeared before Assistant City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Isip</span>
to affirm under oath the veracity of his confessions, he did not complain to
the latter that he did not know the contents of the document and that he was
compelled to execute the same under duress, much less did he file any complaint
against the police officers who allegedly maltreated him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to note that many of the facts in <span class="SpellE">Llamoso's</span> statements were affirmed later by <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar's extrajudicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly observed by Solicitor General,
now Associate Justice of this Court, Hon. Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
"it is absurd to say that <span class="SpellE">Llamoso's</span> confessions
were copied from Aguilar's because except one whose contents only identified
Oscar Padilla, the former were executed earlier." <span class="SpellE">Llamoso's</span>
confessions were made on <st1:date year="1963" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1963</st1:date>
(Exhibit "V"), while Aguilar's were made on <st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1963</st1:date> (Exhibits "P",
"Q") and <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1963</st1:date>
(Exhibit "R").</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>, in impugning his
identification by Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>, claims that it is
highly improbable that the latter, due to fear, could have remembered the face
of the man who poked a gun at his forehead, considering that the persons inside
the Motor Vehicles Office who were confronted with the same situation were not
able to identify any of the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this point, We agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>, unlike the Motor Vehicles Office employees,
stayed for sometime in the company of <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> were together from the time the former picked up
the group in his taxi, throughout their journey along the streets of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and they stayed behind in the taxicab while the rest of the group entered the
Motor Vehicles Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this time
that they were together, <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> acted as <span class="SpellE">Empedrado's</span> guard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> who pointed a gun at <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> shortly before dragging and using him as his
shield when he started firing as they entered the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> <span style="">had all
the opportunity to look at <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> and to remember
his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span>, in his testimony, clearly
and positively identified <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> as one of the five
men who boarded his taxicab and who pointed a gun at him shortly before <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> and his companions entered the Motor Vehicles
Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar's defense
is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that in the
evening of <st1:date year="1963" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1963</st1:date>,
he was performing his duties as security guard at <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>
market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="5" hour="19">7:05</st1:time> in the evening, a boy was apprehended stealing by a
fellow watchman and this boy was endorsed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and three other companions brought this
boy to Manila Police Department Precinct No. 6 where he stayed up to <st1:time minute="20" hour="9">9:20</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Precinct No. 6, he and <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. de <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">los</span>
  Angeles</st1:place></st1:city> took the boy to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Youth</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Arroceros</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> where he
stayed for ten minutes, and after that <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. de <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles</st1:place></st1:city> drove him to <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> market, arriving thereat at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="9">9:45</st1:time>, and thereafter he continued to make
rounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly rejected this defense of alibi of said
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As carefully analyzed by the
trial judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span>,
Jr., Agui­lar's presence at the scene of the crime was clearly established by <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Marcelo, the Manila Police Department Senior
Fingerprint Expert, when he testified that the latent print lifted from the
inner face right side glass window of the abandoned getaway taxi (Exhibits
"E-1" and "I"), tallied with the fingerprints of Aguilar's
middle finger (Exhibits "F-1", "H" and "J").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This positive declaration of an expert witness
stands <span class="SpellE">unrefuted</span> by any competent proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appellant also failed to present <span class="SpellE">Det</span>. de <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">los</span>
  Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>, his alleged companion, or any official of
Precinct No. 6, or anyone from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Youth</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> where the boy was
subsequently taken, to corroborate his alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aguilar, however, claims that his fingerprints were planted by
the police in order to apprehend and bring to the custody of the law the
killers of one of its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this
were true, the police should have also planted the fingerprints of Oscar
Padilla, Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lagim</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagunera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
the taxicab used by the malefactors was examined by <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Marcelo in the same evening of February 28, 1963, shortly after the police had
been notified of the robbery, and he lifted the latent prints from the same
taxicab at 12:55 a.m. of March 1, 1963, while appellant Aguilar was brought to
the police headquarters and his fingerprints taken on March 2, 1963 (Exhibit
"F").</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Aguilar also contends that his extrajudicial
confessions were obtained through force, yet he did not file any complaint
against the police officers who allegedly maltreated him or complain <span style="">to the Fiscal before whom his confessions
were sworn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The confessions contain
details which are confirmatory of the events narrated in <span class="SpellE">Llamoso's</span>
extrajudicial statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, like <span class="SpellE">Llamoso's</span> extrajudicial confessions, appellant's statements
contain <span class="SpellE">informations</span> which only he could have known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that the trial court committed no error in
refusing to accord credence to the allegations of appellant that his
extrajudicial confessions were extracted through force, violence and
intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a claim is rendered
incredible by the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the
testimony of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> and Domingo Gomez on the
voluntary manner in which the extrajudicial declarations were made by the <span class="SpellE">declarants</span> and the circumstances <span class="SpellE">currounding</span>
their <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> under oath by appellants before the
Fiscal; (b) the profusion of details contained therein on the planning,
execution of the crime and flight <span style="">of
the culprits which can only be given by the very person who has experienced the
same or taken part in the execution of the crime; (c) the failure of the
appellants to complain to any of the duly constituted authorities of the
alleged maltreatment before the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
on January 15, 1964 and Aguilar on April 17, 1964; and (d) the circumstance
that many of the facts contained in the aforementioned extrajudicial
confessions were confirmed and corroborated by the other evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Recapitulating, Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
confessed his participation of the robbery where a policeman was fatally
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was positively identified by
Raul <span class="SpellE">Empedrado</span> as one of the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His hand was found positive for gunpowder
residue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar, he too confessed being a member of the
holdup gang who was responsible for the robbery and killing in the Motor
Vehicles Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His fingerprints were
found on the instrument of the crime and his hand was found positive for
gunpowder residue.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, We hold that the trial court did not
commit any error in finding appellants guilty of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction and sentence of
death imposed on appellant Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span> is hereby
AFFIRMED, with the modification that the amount due to the heirs of the victim,
Pat. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Daracan</span>, should be increased to
P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case against appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Aguilar is hereby DISMISSED insofar as his
criminal liability is con­cerned, with proportionate costs <i>de</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>oficio</i></span>.</p>
