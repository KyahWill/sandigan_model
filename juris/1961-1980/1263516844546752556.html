				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendant Jaime <span class="SpellE">Nuevas</span> seeks the reversal of an order of the Court of First
Instance of Manila dismissing his appeal from a decision of the Municipal Court
of Manila, in Civil Case No. 133148 thereof, sentencing him to pay to
plaintiff, Tropical Build­ing Specialties, Inc., the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,815.63</span>, with interest thereon, at the rate of 12% per
annum, from May, 1964 until fully paid, in addition to the sum of P500, as and
for attorney's fees, apart from the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record shows that
plaintiff seeks to recover the price </span>of materials allegedly delivered to
the defendant from 1961 to 1964.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although admitting the deliveries made up to June 23, 1961, with­out
specifying the goods delivered or its value, defendant alleged, in his answer,
that he has "no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to
the truth of the averment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
relating to deliveries made in 1962, 1963 and 1964." As a member of the
Bar, defendant knew that, if said information was necessary for his <span style="">defense, he could have gotten it by applying
for a bill of parti­culars, but he did not ask for one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, since plaintiff had introduced its
evidence in the municipal court, defendant needed no such particulars in the
Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, in
his answer, defendant merely averred that "he had a subsequent agreement
with plaintiff that he would liquidate his account, if any there be, by partial
payments." The total ab­sence of defense on defendant's part is attested
to by the judg­ment of the municipal court granting the relief prayed for in
plaintiff's complaint, except as to attorney's fees, which, in the exercise of
the court's discretion, was reduced from P950 to P500.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant having appealed from this judgment, the record was
forwarded to the Court of First Instance, which caused the case to be set for
pre-trial on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the defendant, this proceeding
and the hearing of the case were postponed first to <st1:date year="1965" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1965</st1:date>, then to <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1966</st1:date>, thereafter to February 16, and
still later to March 15, upon the ground that he was "making efforts at an
amicable settlement." What transpired on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1966</st1:date> is set forth in an order of the same date,
reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon petition of counsel for the defendant for the
postponement of the hearing of this case for the last time, and against the
objection on the part of counsel for the plaintiff, let the hearing of this
case be postponed for the last time to <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4">April
 21, 1966</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30 a.m.</st1:time>, a
date selected by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
understood that no further postponement will be countenanced by the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The parties were notified of this order in open court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Despite the warning contained in this order, defendant did not
show up on scheduled time, in view of which the lower court authorized
plaintiff, <span style="">in </span>an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1966</st1:date>, to present its
evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the defendant, over plaintiff's
objection, the Court, acting under the belief that the former was still
"trying to settle" the case amicably, reconsi­dered said order of <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1966</st1:date> and set the case for
hearing on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, however, the defendant filed, on <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1966</st1:date>, an unverified petition
to transfer the hearing to another date, preferably in the latter part of
August, upon the ground that he had, on <st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1966</st1:date>, a hearing in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">N-428 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, "which
hearing was first set."</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="7"><span style="">July 7,
 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower
court issued the appealed order, from which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When this case was called for hearing this morning counsel
for the defendant was absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever,
there is attached to the record an urgent peti­tion of said counsel to transfer
the hearing to ano­ther date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
the strong opposition of coun­sel for the plaintiff on the ground that the
promise contained in the petition to settle his case out of court was also made
by counsel for the defendant when this case was still in the City Court but
that he has not done anything to comply with it, thus creating doubt as to the
sincerity of said counsel, the petition is hereby denied, and on motion of coun­sel
for the plaintiff, the appeal is dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let this case be remanded to the court of ori­gin for
execution of the judgment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">Considering
that, the hearing of this case in the Court of First Instance had been
postponed five (5) times, on motion of the defendant; that the order of March
15, postponing the hearing to April 21, explicitly stated that it was the
"last," and that "no further postponement" would "be
countenanced by the Court"; that, despite defendant's failure to appear,
in due time, on April 21, said Court granted him, on May 31, another
opportunity to be heard on July 7; that, although defendant claims that the
hearing of his case in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> had been set
"first," or before May 31, 1966, he had ample time to make
representations to this effect, in the Court of First Instance of Manila,
before July, 1966, but did not do so until July 6, 1966, or on the eve of the
hearing of the present case; that the defendant succeeded in securing several
postpone­ments by giving the impression that he was trying to settle the case
amicably, which he never did; that the record suggests that he has no valid
defense and that the present appeal is purely dilatory in nature; that
postponements of hearings are matters primarily addressed to the discretion of the
Court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the exercise of which </span>should not be
interfered with on appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in the absence of a ma­nifest abuse of discretion;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and that no such abuse exists in the case at bar, it is obvious that the order
appealed from must be sustained.</p>
