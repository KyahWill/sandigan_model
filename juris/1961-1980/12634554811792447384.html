Appraisers' Division reported the merchandise for seizure for alleged violation
of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in relation to Sections 1363 (f) and
1250 in the Revised Administrative Code, be­cause one of the requirements for
release is the pre­sentation of Central Bank release certificate; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the
merchandise was released un­der surety bond pending seizure proceedings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the conclusion of said seizure proceedings, the Collector of
Customs for the Port of Manila, in two (2) separate decisions ordered
petitioner and her surety, to jointly and severally pay the full amount of the
bonds filed by them for the release of the goods in question, upon the ground
that the same had been imported in viola­tion of said circulars, in relation to
Sections 1250 and 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal taken by petitioner, said decisions
were affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Peti­tioner appealed from the latter's decisions to the Court of Tax
Appeals, with the same result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her brief, petitioner maintains that the Court of Tax Ap­peals
erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in holding that the
importations are covered by Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 of the Central Bank; (2)
in affirming the decisions of the Commissioner of Customs, despite the alleged
repeal of said circulars by Circular No. 133 of the Monetary Board promulgated
on January 21, 1962; (3) in not holding that the sanction prescribed for
violation of said Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 is imposable, not by the customs
authorities, but by the courts of justice, upon criminal prosecution instituted
at the initiative of the, Central Bank; (4) in not holding that the customs
authorities are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to decree the seizure of
said goods, once the same have been re­leased, after collecting the customs
duties and taxes due for the importation thereof; and (5) in holding that
dollar remittances were involved in the importation in question,
notwithstanding the stipula­tion between the parties to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is already settled that that no-dollar importations, made
while Central Bank Circular Nos. 44 and 45 were in force — such as those
involved in the case bar — required, pursuant to the provisions of said
circulars, a, Central Bank release certificate — under the theory that
practically "all imports," including those involving no-dollar
exchange, represent either an "immediate demand x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> or a potential demand, of foreign exchange"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> —
so that the Central Bank may know the precise volume of our imports of whatever
nature, for guidance in the formu­lation of its policies; that importations, or
the attempt to import goods without the required release certificate,
constituted a violation of sections 1250 and 1363 of the Revised Administrative
Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and are subject to the forfeiture therein provided; and that the liabilities
thus incurred by the importer have not been abrogated or extinguished in
consequence of the promulgation of Central Bank Circular No. 133.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to note that the enforcement of said section
1363 of the Revised Administrative Code and other matters arising under the
Customs Laws or other laws or parts of laws administered by the Bureau of
Customs, including seizures made and forfeitures im­posed in relation thereto,
are explicitly placed by law under the authority of the Commission of Customs,
whose power to decide said matters is subject to review by the Court of Tax
Appeals;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that the bonds filed by petitioner and her surety for the release of the goods
in question expressly acknowledge the authority of the Government to demand
payment of the full amount of said bonds, should the forfeiture of said goods
be eventually decreed; that the release of the goods was thus se­cured by
herein petitioner <u>subject to the right of the Government to decree the
forfeiture of said goods</u>; and that, accordingly, <u>petitioner is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to question such right</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from should be, as it is
hereby, affirmed, with costs against petitioner Juana T. de la Cruz.</p>
