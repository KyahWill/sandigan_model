				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an administrative case filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1967</st1:date> by Atty. Eduardo B. Santos against
Hon. Union <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>
Angeles, Judge of the Court of First Instance and Assistant Provincial Fiscal
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, respectively, charging them with improper
and unethical acts in connection with their official functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents filed their answers to the com­plaint, after which
the case was assigned to Hon. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cañizares</span>,
Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, for investigation, report and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant was counsel for the defense in a criminal case (No.
15403) in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
wherein - three brothers - <span class="SpellE">Natalio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Pornobi</span> - were charged with murder for the
fatal stabbing of one <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Valdez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned to Branch II of said
court, pre­sided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strangely
enough, the administrative complaint was lodged as a result of a motion by
respondent Fiscal for the dismissal of the criminal case and of the order
granting the motion issued by respondent Judge, who had taken over the case
from Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ordinarily it should be the relatives - in this case the widow
particularly - of the victim of the alleged murder who would feel aggrieved by
the dis­missal, and not the lawyer for the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the widow has not seen fit to complain;
indeed it was at her behest that the dismissal came about.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigation report of Justice Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cañizares</span>
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At the trial, the defense tried to establish that the mortal
wounds sustained by the victim were in­flicted solely by <span class="SpellE">Natalio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pornobi</span> in legitimate self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the prosecution
maintained that the slaying was participated in by the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>
three brothers, and that the kill­ing was plain murder and not justi­fiable
homicide as alleged by the defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the lower Court, the pro­secution rested its case with the
presentation of the following wit­nesses and the submission of the following
exhibits:</blockquote>

<blockquote>After these witnesses had testified, Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>
issued an order in this tenor:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'On motion of defense counsel and without objection on the
part of the prosecution, the continuation of the hearing of this case is
ordered post­poned to April 20, 1966 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be understood that the setting of
this case on said date is non­transferable in character and that the court will
not countenance further postponement as the court noticed that <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> this case is set for hearing new witnesses are
being mentioned by defense counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
defense counsel is ordered to give a list of wit­nesses they will present and
if the defense is not yet ready on the date this case is set for continuation
of hearing, the court will consider the defense to have rested their case as
the court has already given sufficient time to the defense to prepare for its
defense.' <span class="GramE">(Exhibit C-6)".</span></p>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1966</st1:date>,
the herein complainant received an order from the clerk of court postponing the
case until further assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
order was issued two (2) days before the date scheduled for the final hearing
of the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 20, 1966, apparently without notice to all the parties and
their lawyers, respondent Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> Angeles
moved for the dismissal of the said murder case before respondent Judge Union
C. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> (who in the meantime had taken over the
duties of Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span> who went on leave), on the
ground that the witnesses were no longer interested in testifying for the
Government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the very same date, that is, <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1966</st1:date>, respondent Judge Union C. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> granted the said motion to dismiss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The complainant has insti­tuted the present administrative case on
the theory (1) that respondent Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> Angeles
acted improperly in filing the motion to dismiss considering that the
prosecution had already rested its case; and (2) that respondent Judge Union C.
Kayanan did not have the inherent authority and discretion to dismiss a murder
case heard and tried by another Judge of equal rank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As to the first question:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant contended that since the prosecution had already rested
its case, the filing of the motion to dismiss by respondent fiscal <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> Angeles was highly irregular and improper, more so,
as the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were al­legedly false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in his sworn statement the complainant
alleged that the mother of the three (3) accused had told him that she had
already reached an agreement with the Judge and Fiscal Angeles for the
dismissal of the case if he (complainant) would just file a motion to dismiss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In reply to this charge the respondent fiscal averred that he never
talked to the mother of the accused, nor did he even know the said
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that while it was
Assistant Fiscal Jose <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span> who appeared for the
prosecution during the trial, nevertheless he was present at the trial of the
case, and had knowledge of the evidence adduced for he was the one assigned to
prosecute all criminal cases in Branch II of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter
of fact after the prosecu­tion had rested its side, he took over the active
prosecution of the case, cross-examining the witnesses for the defense, which
circumstance appears in the transcript of the stenographic notes (Exhibit
1-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Fiscal likewise stated
that since he was as­signed to prosecute all criminal cases in Branch II he,
therefore, had full control and supervision of said cases, and this implies the
authority to file the aforesaid motion to dismiss, especially so, since at the
time he filed the said motion the provincial fiscal was absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, he honestly believed that
the evidence for the State was insufficient to sustain the conviction of all
the accused, contending that the failure of <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
Bautista, the other ocular witness for the prosecution to testify, had left the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Joaquinito</span> <span class="SpellE">Portes</span>
uncorroborated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
complaining widow, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Abracia</span> and the
aforementioned eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Joaquinito</span> <span class="SpellE">Portes</span> approached him and told him that they were no longer
interested in prosecuting the case and that they would not appear <i>as </i>rebuttal
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further declared that the
witness <span class="SpellE">Portes</span> in particular asseverated that except
for the stabbing of the victim he knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding
the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account of this deve­lopment
he asked them to execute an affidavit of retraction but they refused to do so,
saying that they were afraid that they might be held liable for some crimes
instead, they signified their intention to consult their lawyer, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cayo</span> <span class="SpellE">Desembrano</span>, the private
prosecutor in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1966</st1:date>, the said witnesses
did execute their affidavits before special counsel <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Florido</span>, which affidavits embodied the circumstances
hereinbefore related.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confronted with
these cir­cumstances, respondent fiscal claimed he was left with no other
alternative but to file the motion to dismiss in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anent the second issue:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant maintained that the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>
criminal case was "lifted" from the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span> by the
herein respondents and that the said act was highly irregular and unethical.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The foregoing charge, according to respondent Judge Union <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span>, is malicious, because the complainant ad­mitted
that the latter learned of the dismissal of the case some four or five months
after April 18, 1966, and that the complainant never cared to inquire whether
Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span> was actually on duty on April 20, 1966,
or who were the judges on duty in the Court of First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City at the time; and that moreover after April 15,
1966, the presiding Judge of Branch II, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>, went on
leave for two months (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 7), as a result of which
the Department of Justice, by administrative order No. 425 (Exhibit 6),
assigned herein respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> "to
hold court in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City effective December 1, 1965
or as soon thereafter as practicable for the purpose of trying all kinds of
cases and to enter judgment therein," and that this authority included the
dockets of Branches I and II of the said Court of First Instance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span> testified that
before he took his leave of absence on the second half of April 1966, he
requested respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span> to "please
hear those incidents which are important in nature, especially those involving
detained prisoners because I was leaving, there may be petitions or motions, or
incidents pending in my <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> which needs immediate
action."</blockquote>

<blockquote>From these incontrovertible facts, it seems quite clear that
respondent Judge was not guilty of "lifting" the said criminal case
from the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is clear that the
respondent Judge had the authority to act on the said case and to enter
judgment thereon pursuant to Administrative Order No. 25 and considering
further that Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span> himself had personally
requested him to act on petitions, motions or incidents pertaining his <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> which needed immediate action, particularly those
involving detained prisoners, which the accused were.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let it be conceded that the proper course of action which the
respondent Judge should have taken in the premises was to render a judgment of
acquittal on the merits, that is, if he in fact believed, as indeed he
believed, that the evidence at bar could not maintain a judgment of conviction,
instead of dismissing the case, in view of the fact that the prosecution had
already rested its case and the defense was almost through with the
presentation of its evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
error, however, is an error of judgment, to which any judge, human that he is,
may at times fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic thing to
remember -- and here the record speaks for itself -- is that there is not a
shred of evidence to show that the respondents were bribed or promised anything
in money, goods or favor, to betray their trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may <i>-- </i>because of the
semblance of neg­ligence in their actuations -- respond­ent Judge and
respondent fiscal should be advised to show more caution, prudence and
circumspection in dealing with like or similar cases in the future to the end
that nothing may ever destroy the popular faith and confidence in the integrity
of our courts of justice which, as we all know, are the last shield and shelter
of our civil liberties."</blockquote>

<div class="Section2">

<p class="BODY">A number of additional circumstances may be mentioned in order to
place the present administrative complaint in proper perspective.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of respondent
Judge dismissing criminal case No. 15403 was issued on <st1:date year="1966" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint in the instant administrative case was filed on <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1967</st1:date>, or some eleven months
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that on January 26,
1967, respondent Judge subscribed to an affidavit wherein, referring to certain
administrative charges likewise lodged by Atty. Eduardo R. Santos, the same
complainant here, against Judge <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>, the affiant stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>". . . upon knowing that Atty. Eduardo
R. Santos filed charges against Judge <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>, I had occasion to talk with Atty. Santos in my
chamber and asked him why he filed charges against Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>
and Atty. Santos, in answer to me said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Judge, I only have two (2) paying cases, and Judge <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>
has ignored and humiliated me.'" This affidavit tends to explain why:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) this administrative case was initiated
only after a considerably long period of time had elapsed since the order of
respondent Judge complained of was issued; and (b) why the defense counsel
filed the case notwithstanding the fact that his own clients had been favored
by the said order.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge
evidently found himself faced with a dilemma in the criminal case which he
sought to resolve in accordance with what he considered as the imperatives of
ultimate justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus he alleges in his
answer to the complaint:</p>

<blockquote>"Before the herein respondent dis­missed the case, knowing
that the prosecution already rested and the defense was almost through in the
presentation of its witnesses, Co-Respondent Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>
Angeles for the first time approached us in chamber and unveiled his
dilemma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He represented that after the
widow (Lydia <span class="SpellE">Abracia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Valdez) and supposed government eye-witness (<span class="SpellE">Joaquinito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Portes</span>) heard the four (4) defense witnesses, their
conscience bothered them and real­ized that what the influential relatives of
the victim (<span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Valdez) prodded upon them to
testify in Court was absolutely false, and considering that the vital and
material eye-witness (<span class="SpellE">Wil­fredo</span> Bautista) who was
listed as the first witness in the Informa­tion refused to appear in Court,
they pleaded to said Fiscal to dismiss the case; that they did not want to be a
party in the miscarriage of justice; that the widow wanted the accused to feel
indebted to her if she took the initiative to dismiss the case, instead of
waiting for the uncertainty of acquittal; that both witnesses refused to sign
affidavits retracting their testimony in Court for fear they might be
prosecuted for perjury; and that the widow pitied the accused who were then
languishing in jail for more than (3) years, because they are so poor and could
not even afford to put up bail bonds for their provisional liberty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After a cursory examination of the records, the herein Respondent
came across the Motion to Dismiss (ANNEX "IV") filed by Complainant
on Dec. 10, 1963 before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pagbilao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> for co-accused <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> <span class="SpellE">Pornobi</span>,
which however, was denied."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar situation
confronted respondent Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleges
in his answer:</p>

<blockquote>"a-<span style=""> </span>Lydia <span class="SpellE">Abracia</span>, widow
of the late victim <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> Valdez, and the lone
eye-witness to the incident, <span class="SpellE">Joaquinito</span> <span class="SpellE">Portes</span>, approached the herein respondent at his office and
revealed that, after they had heard defense's witnesses in Court, they verified
the truth of latter's testimony from other witnesses, having actual knowledge
of the occurrence, but who, for some reasons unknown to them have not appeared,
as wit­nesses in the case, and they were finally convinced of defendants'
innocence, and consequently, they decided to desist from appearing at the
continuation of Hearing, as state's rebuttal witnesses, and in view thereof,
they requested that a Motion for the dismissal of the case be submitted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After studying the records of the case, he
told those two who came to this office that, since the prosecution had already
rested, and the defense was in the process of adducing evidence, he could not
move to dismiss the case, until and unless they retracted their testimony on
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They informed him that they
would think the matter over, and consult their lawyer, the private prosecutor,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cayo</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Desembrana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They returned later, and because he was, busy
then, they executed and signed their respec­tive Affidavits before Special
Counsel <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Florido</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>c-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cayo</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Desembrana</span> came to see him in Office, bringing the
above-mentioned Affidavits of his clients.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This private prosecutor told him that, after learning from his clients
that they themselves were convinced of <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
innocence and after consultation with victim's other relatives, he could no longer
continue the prosecution of the case, and, therefore, urged him to submit a
petition to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked such
private prosecutor why it appeared in the cited Affidavits that the complainant
and her witness were just no longer interested in prosecuting the case instead
of making a stronger stand and citing their belief in defendants'
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Desembrana</span>
explained that, if his clients would recant outright their previous
declaration, they might be liable for perjury.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He told Atty. <span class="SpellE">Desembrana</span> to return and bring
to him the affiants for conference, and so, all three appeared a little later,
re-affirmed their previous request to dismiss the case, reiterated their belief
in <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> innocence, and restated their
determination not to appear anymore at the continuation of Trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, he told them that he would
further deliberate on the matter, and see if it would be possible for him to
request the dismissal of the case."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any suspicion that
respondent Fiscal, in proceeding as he did, was inspired by other motives than
to do justice to the parties concerned, is dispelled by the fact that the
complainant in the criminal case was represented by a private prosecutor, who
could be expected to act only in the interests of his client, the widow of the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only did he not object to
the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> motion for dismissal, but it was he
himself who proposed that it be filed after under­standably rejecting the
suggestion that the widow sign an affidavit retracting her testimony in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The error of respondents, as pointed out by the investigator is
in the procedure adopted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in terminating
the case upon motion to dismiss instead of through a judgment the merits,
considering that the evidence-in-chief for the prosecution was already in and the
evidence for the defense could soon be com­pleted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The turnabout of the two principal witnesses
for the prosecution in their affidavits was not made on the witness stand in
the course of the trial, and merely referred to their unwillingness to testify further
in the case (presumably as rebuttal witnesses).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was at best of dubious sufficiency to overcome the testimony they had
already given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their protestations of
belief in the innocence of the accused, as voiced by them to respondents, were
not made a matter of record; and if respondents were convinced of the truth
thereof that conviction was strictly <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pectore</u></span>,
which accounts for the fact that it is now ere mentioned in the motion to
dismiss and in the order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents may have served the ultimate ends of justice in this
particular case - there is nothing in the record to show otherwise - but the
procedure they followed failed to take into consideration its possible adverse
effect on the people's faith and confidence in the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the case was not a litigation between two
private parties but one in which the in­terests of society were involved; and
to avoid any doubt as to the correctness of the verdict of acquittal it should
have been on the merits, upon due consideration of the evidence already of
record and, if need be, of such other evidence as might still be taken.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, respondents are hereby strongly admonished to
be more careful in the performance of their duties in the light of what has
been stated in this decision.</p>
