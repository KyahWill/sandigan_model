<p>In addition to this agreed statement of facts, oral and documentary evidence was presented.</p>
<p>Upon the statement of facts and evidence, the court rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which reads, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>EN MERITOS DE TODO LO EXPUESTO, el Juzgudo fulla

y, const- guientemente, se dicta sentencia declarando nula y de ningun

  <p>Las cost as del juicio seran tasadas en contra de los recurvidos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this judgment, the Mayor of the City of ISacoIod and Daisy B.
Gustilo appealed to the Court of Appeals on questions of law. and fact,
and the petitioners appealed to this Court on the claim for damages,
which was denied by the trial court for insufficiency of evidence.</p>
<p>Daisy B. Gustilo claims that the trial court erred in—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*** denying respondent-appellant Gustilo's motion to
dismiss, motion, for reconsideration of the order denying her motion to
dismiss, and motion to dismiss the second amended petition;</p>
  <p>***
deciding this case solely on the basis of the reasons stated in the
award (Exhibit "A-G") and Section 3 of Ordinance No. 13 and in not
taking into account the admission of the parties in their agreed
statement of facts and the testimony of respondent Mayor concerning the
material facts and circumstances surrounding the award and subsequent
sale of Lot No. 379-B-40 to respondent Daisy B. Gustilo;</p>
  <p>***
holding that respondent Mayor did not fellow the provisions of
Ordinance No. 13 in awarding without lottery Lot No. 379-B-40 to
respondent Gustilo;</p>
  <p>*** ordering the respondent Mayor to
conduct a raffle to determine who among the parties shall be the sole
awardee of Lot No. 379-B-40;</p>
  <p>*** declaring the award (Exhibit "A-6") null and void;</p>
  <p>*** not dismissing the present petition for mandamus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The respondent Mayor of Bacolod City imputes two errors allegedly committed by the trial court to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The lower court erred in holding that the 4th
condition specified in subsection (c), Section 3, Ordinance No. 13,
Series of 1959, is the only mandatory provision to be complied with by
the respondent-appellant Teofisto M. Cordova, in making the award for
Lot No. 379-B-40, and in not taking also into consideration the
mandatory provision of condition No. 5 (last sentence) of same
subsection (c), Section 3 of the aforestated ordinance; and</p>
  <p>The
lower court erred in not considering the import of the conference
between respondent-appellant Mayor Cordova and the contending parties
herein on July 81, 1968, and of the letters sent by the
petitioners-appellees to the City Council of Bacolod, the City Mayor
and the President of the Philippines and in holding that the Mayor of
the City of Bacolod, herein respondent-appellant, did not comply with
the provisions of Section 3 of Ordinance No. 13, Series of 1959, when
he awarded lot No. 379-B-40, without lottery, in favor of the
respondent-appellant Daisy B. Gustilo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petitioners as appellants assign two errors claimed to have been committed by the trial court, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The lower court erred in deciding, for all practical
purposes, that a public official who has been found to have failed in
the compliance of (with) his ministerial duty, is not liable for
damages; and</p>
  <p>The lower court erred in declaring only the
award to be null and void and in not declaring that the deed of sale
also is null and void.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court of Appeals certified the record of the case to this Court
for review and final determination pursuant to the provision of section
17 (5) of Republic Act No. 296, as amended by Republic Act No. 2613.</p>
<p>Section 3 of Ordinance No. 13, series of 1959, of Bacolod City provides—</p>
<p><em>Award</em>.—In the award or sale of any and all of the above
subdivision lota, the following rules, priority or preference shall be
strictly observed:</p>
<p>(c) Except side-lots bordering Lacson and Burgos Streets, there
shall be, at most, two awardeea to a lot having 251 square meters, or
more in area who shall divide the lot share and share alike; Provided,
however, that should there be but two occupants as understood in
subparagraph (b) hereinabove immediately preceding, they shall upon
proper applications made in accordance with Section ,"7" hereof, be
deemed and considered the awardees of that particular lot who shall
divide the same share and share alike; Provided, further, that, should
there be three or more occupants claiming preferences to one lot the
two awardees to the same shall have to be determined by lottery among
them; Provided, nevertheless, that, in cases where one of the three or
more occupants actually occupied at least one-half of the lot, said
occupant shall thereby be deemed and considered as one of the two
awardees, the remaining half to be determined by lottery among the
other occupants; Provided, finally, that, <em>in no ease shall there be more than one</em> (1) <em>awardee with respect to tide lots bordering Lacson and Burgos Streets and that, should there be more than one</em> (1) <em>claimant claiming preferences in and over a particular one lot, the award to only one shall be determined by lottery</em>. However, should one of the several occupants claiming preferences occupy or possess <em>at least two-third</em> (2/3) <em>of
a particular lot bordering these streets, said occupant shall thereby,
upon application duly made, be deemed and considered the awardee of the
particular lot to the exclusion of all other occupants of the same</em>.
The award herein shall always be subject to the requirements contained,
made and provided, in Article IV, Section 9, and Article V, Section 5,
paragraph (c) of Ordinance No. 140, Series of 1057, otherwise known as
the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Raculod. (Italics supplied)</p>
<p>Under the above-quoted provisions, the petitioner contend that the
lot could not be awarded without holding a raffle. On the other hand,
the respondent City Mayor claims that he could award the lot without
holding a lottery because the petitioners, in their letters to the City
Council of Bacolod (Exhibit A-4) and interview or conference with the
City Mayor of Bacolod (Exhibit A-5), reiterated the desire to buy only
the parts of the lot actually occupied by their houses and did not ask
for the held ing of a lottery or raffle; and that die was empowered by
section 6 of the ordinance to implement its provisions when the sale of
the lot is not covered by the provision of the ordinance.</p>
<p>The only award that can be made without holding a raffle pursuant to
the provisions of the ordinance quoted above is when one claimant
occupied at least 2/3 of the lot, but as Daisy B. Gustilo's house
occupies an area of 170 square meters of the lot containing a total
area of 289 square meters, which is less than 2/3, she does not come
under the provisions of the ordinance which would make her the awardee
of the whole lot without the holding of a raffle. The requirements
provided in Article IV, section 9, and article V, section 6, paragraph
(c), of Ordinance No. 140, series of 1957, otherwise known as the
Zoning Ordinance of the City of Bacolod, cannot be invoked by the Mayor
and his co-respondent Daisy B. Gustilo; because such requirements are
to be complied with after the award and sale of the lot shall have been
made.</p>
<p>It does not appear that the City Mayor in making the award of the
lot to his co-respondent acted in bad faith. An erroneous
interpretation of the meaning of the provisions of an ordinance does
not constitute nor does it amount to bad faith that would entitle an
aggrieved party to an award for damages.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from in affirmed, with costs against the respondents.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Paredes, Regala</em> and <em>Makalintal, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
