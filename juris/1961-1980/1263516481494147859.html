				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila,
granting defendant’s motion to dismiss and, accordingly, dismissing plaintiffs'
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Claiming to have acted as trustees of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cantonesa</span> de Manila - hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span> plaintiffs Lu Ming, Lam Loy and Lee Won, filed
the complaint herein, with the Court of First Instance of Manila, to compel the
Register of Deeds of Manila to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. 63964,
in the name of his co-defendant, the Manila Cantonese Association, Inc. -
hereinafter referred to as the Corporation upon the ground that the same had
been issued in consequence of a deed of conveyance fraudulently executed by defendant
<span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>, purporting to act
on behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>, in favor of the
Corporation, and to secure from the latter and defendants Vicente Lopez, <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> Fernandez, Francisco Lee <span class="SpellE">Llacer</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leong</span> Chew and <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>, an accounting of the earnings of the property covered
by said title, as well as to recover exemplary damages and attorney's fees,
apart from the costs and expenses of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being summoned, defendants <st1:city><st1:place>Vicente
  Lopez</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Leong</span> Chew and <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> filed separate motions to
dismiss, all predi­cated upon plaintiffs' alleged lack of legal capacity to
sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motions of the first two (2),
likewise, maintained that plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, defendants
Francisco Lee <span class="SpellE">Llacer</span> and <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span>
Fernandez filed their respective answers, admitting the formal allegations of
the complaint, denying the other allegations thereof and setting up affirmative
defenses - including lack of capacity to sue and absence of a cause of action -
as well as a counterclaim for damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After due hearing, the lower court issued the order appealed from,
granting said motions to dismiss and dismissing the complaint, upon the ground
"that the plaintiffs are without legal capacity to bring this
action." A reconsideration of said order having been denied, plaintiffs
interposed this appeal, di­rectly to the Supreme Court, in which only one
question of law is raised, namely, whether "plaintiffs have no legal
capacity to sue."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that plaintiffs - Lu Ming, Lam Loy and Lee E. Won -
and defendants Vicente Lopez, <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> Fernandez, Francisco
Lee <span class="SpellE">Llacer</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leong</span> Chew and <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>, were members of a
corporation organized, on September 1, 1908, under the name <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cantonesa</span> de Manila, the lifetime of which was
scheduled to expire, pursuant to the Corporation Law<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
50 years later, or on September 1, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About a week before the date last mentioned, or on August 23, 1958, the
Board of Director of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>, which consisted
of fifteen (15) members, including plaintiffs herein, approved a resolution
constituting themselves as Board of Liquidators of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>,
with authority, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, to dispose
of the corporate assets, "by sale, donation, or otherwise, or in
trust" for the benefit of its members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This board of liquidators, however, failed to wind up the corporate
affairs during the incumbency of its aforementioned members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although re-elected as members of the board
of directors, and, hence, of the board of liquidators, from 1958 to 1960,
plaintiffs herein lost in their bid for election in 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, defendants <st1:city><st1:place>Vicente
  Lopez</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Leong</span> Chew and <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> were among the fifteen
(15) members of the Board of Directors then elected.</p>

<p class="BODY">By resolution, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1961</st1:date>, the members of this new board of directors constituted
themselves as Board of Liquidators of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>,
with authority to convey the properties thereof to the Corporation, which had,
meanwhile, been organized to continue the humanitarian purposes of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among
said properties were three (3) parcels of land, with the building and other
improvements thereon, located at <span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Poblete</span> Streets, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and more particularly described in T.C.T. No. 17024 of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new board of liquidators, likewise,
authorized the corporate secretary, defendant <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>, to execute, on behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>,
the corresponding deed of conveyance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, acting in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>,
on <st1:date year="1961" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1961</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> conveyed the
aforementioned land, with the building and improvements existing thereon, to
the Corporation, and T.C.T. No. 63964 of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
was issued in its favor, upon cancellation of said T.C.T. No. 17204, in the
name of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">About four (4) years later, or on <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1965</st1:date>, plaintiffs herein commenced the present
action, for the purpose above indicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In their complaint, plaintiffs do not allege that they are trustees of
the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They merely
claim to have <u>acted</u> as such trustees thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At best, however, those who acted as trustees
were not plaintiffs herein, but the <u>Board</u> of Directors for the years
1958 to 1960, of which plaintiffs were merely three (3) of its fifteen (15)
members, thus constituting a small minority thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is not alleged in the complaint
that plaintiffs represent either said Board of Directors or the Board of
Liquidators, or the majority of either.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, they ceased to be members of the Board of Directors in
1960, others having been elected thereto, in lieu of them, in 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, plaintiffs' authority to
participate in the liquidation of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>,
likewise, came to an end in 1960, for the resolution constituting the Board of
Directors of which they formed part, as Board of Liquidators, being good only
"until their successors shall have been selected and qualified in
accordance with x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> law
and x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
By-Laws," in the language of said resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, by resolution of March 31, 1961, the members of the
Board of Directors for 1961, constituted themselves into another Board of
Liquidators, which, as such, and, acting within the scope of its authority,
authorized <span class="SpellE">Kok</span> <span class="SpellE">Ko</span> to convey
the property in question to the Corporation, which had seemingly been organized
to continue the humanitarian objectives of the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>,
inasmuch as the dissolution of the latter was due merely to the expiration of
the maximum term of fifty (50) years allowed by the Corporation Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, there is no allegation in the complaint to the
effect that the aforementioned property had ever been conveyed to the
plaintiffs as trustees thereof, so that the records before us show they have no
authority to sue for the recovery of said property, either as alleged trustees
or on behalf of the "<span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, inasmuch as it has no juridical
existence, even for pur­poses of liquidation, since <st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1961</st1:date>, not even the <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span> could have, in fact, brought the present action.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[1]</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5pt;">, </span>the order appealed from should be, as it
is hereby affirmed, with costs against plaintiffs-appellants, Lu Ming, Lam Loy
and Lee Won.</p>
