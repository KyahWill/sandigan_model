				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1975</st1:date>,
the Court promulgated a Resolution in the above-entitled case, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL <span style="">THE FOREGOING, </span>respondent is hereby found guilty of grave
ignorance of the provisions of Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code as amended
by Republic Act No. 4363 and of the provisions of Section 87 of the Judiciary
Act of 1948, as amended, for which he shall suffer the penalty of suspension
without pay for a period of six (6) months, <span style="">effective upon receipt of this resolution."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the resolution was received by the respondent on <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1975</st1:date>, and on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1975</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
he filed a motion for the reconsideration of said resolution.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1975</st1:date>, the
respondent filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration, praying for the
modification of the judgment upon the ground that the penalty imposed upon him
"is highly incom<span style="">mensurate to the
error committed, if there was any."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Both </span>motions were denied on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1977</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But, while said motions were pending consideration, the
Collecting and Disbursing Officer of this Court, in contemplation of the
resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1975</st1:date>,
withheld payment of the salary of the respondent judge, corresponding to the
months from September, 1975 to February, 1976, inclusive, although the
respondent judge was regularly performing his judicial duties during said
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">September 9, 1977, the
respondent judge filed a second motion for the reconsideration of the
Resolution of July 25, </span>1975, praying that since he was not paid his
salary for <span style="">six </span>(6) months, thus
serving part of the punishment meted to him and leaving only that portion of
suspension <span class="SpellE">unserved</span>, the judgment "be modified
by suppressing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the suspension from office
and thus modified the non-payment of salary be<span style=""> pronounced to have been complied with by the respondent."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The Court, however, denied the motion
on <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1979</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 4, 1979, the respondent judge filed a pleading <span style="">denominated </span>CLARIFICATORY
MANIFESTATION, respecting the execution of the resolution of July 25, 1975,
asking whether or not he will still be suspended for <span style="">six </span>(<span style="">6) months, but with
pay since the monetary portion of the judgment had already been satisfied when
his salary for the period of six (6) months </span><span style="">had </span>been withheld from him.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Officer recommends:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>that the order of suspension of
respondent judge for the period of six (6) months without pay be now implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, considering that his salary (under
the old rate) for seven (7) months (September 1975 to March 1976) were actually
withheld from him while he continued to serve as such judge after he filed his
motion for reconsideration of the order of suspension issued by this Court on
July 25, 1975, the total amount of what was withheld from him should be
refunded to him, or in the alternative his present salary may be paid to him
while serving the <span style="">six </span>(6) months suspension (his salary for the same period under
the old rate having been withheld from him already) or to release to <span style="">him during his suspension the difference between
his present salary and his old salary."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After considering the circumstances of the case, as well as the
arguments adduced, We are of the opinion that it would be just and reasonable
to all concerned by amending the judgment and reduce the penalty imposed upon
the respondent judge to a fine equivalent to his salary for <span style="">six </span>(6) months and then consider the judgment,
so amended, as having been fully satisfied in view of the non-payment of the
respondent's salary for the same period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For one, no material benefit will be attained in further suspending the
respondent from his position, <span style="">and
nothing is lost in allowing him to continue with the performance of his
judicial duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, to
remit to the respondent judge his withheld salary and thereafter order his
suspension from office without pay, pursuant to the resolution of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25,
 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> would leave the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Mabalacat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
without a judge and thereby cause the clogging of </span>its <span style="">docket.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the imposition of the fine, the judicial actuations of the
respondent judge shall have been sufficiently rectified as </span>to <span style="">dissuade him from committing another mistake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE,</b><span style=""> </span>the resolution of May 9, 1979 is set
aside, and the resolution of July 25, 1975 is hereby amended to the effect that
the respondent judge is sentenced to pay a fine equivalent to his salary for <span style="">six </span>(6) months; and it appearing that
the respondent judge has not been paid his salary for such a period, such
non-payment of his salary shall be considered as satisfaction in full of the
judgment, as amended, and the case considered CLOSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge is enjoined to be more
sedulous in the discharge of his judicial duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commission of a similar offense will be
dealt with more severely.</p>
