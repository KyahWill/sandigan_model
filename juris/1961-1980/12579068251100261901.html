decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, convicting him of the crime of murder and 
sentencing him to life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased 
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> in the sum of P5,000, without 
subsidiary imprisonment, in case of insolvency, owing to the nature of the 
principal penalty, and to pay the costs. 
<p>It is not disputed that, while <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was 
walking near his house, in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span>, 
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lagonoy</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on May 10, 1954, 
between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m., appellant <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> had shot 
him with a rifle, thereby inflicting upon <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> 
two (2) gunshot wounds which caused his death, soon thereafter, in consequence 
of the resulting profuse acute hemorrhage.</p>
<p>The evidence for the prosecution is to the effect that, as <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was heading towards his aforementioned house, he 
heard someone nearby say "halt" and then cock his gun; that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> thereby became scared and thereupon began to run 
away; and that, standing beside a coconut tree, near the road where <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was, <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> then fired 
his rifle at <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>, with the result already 
adverted to. </p>
<p>Upon the other hand, the defense introduced evidence to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> had threatened to shoot Pedro <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span>, according to a complaint filed by the latter; that 
the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Lagonoy</span> had, consequently, 
ordered <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>, a member of its police force, to 
proceed to the aforementioned barrio of <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> and 
disarm <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>; that, in compliance with this order, 
<span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> went to <span class="SpellE">Rivero's</span> house 
in said barrio and asked <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> about the place where 
<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> could be found; that, having been informed 
by <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was 
not in his house, a few meters away, and that he probably would show up later, 
he (<span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>) decided to patrol the vicinity; that, at 
about 8:00 p.m., he saw <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> coming towards him; 
that, thereupon, he (<span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>) took cover behind a 
coconut tree and twice bade <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> to halt; that 
<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> ignored these warnings and advanced slowly 
towards <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>, looking intently at him; that this 
induced <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> to believe that he (<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>) intended to fight, in view of which <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> warned him again to halt and fired into the air; and 
that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> then placed his right hand on the left 
side of his waist, as if to draw a gun <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, 
whereupon <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> fired, aiming at his (<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>') legs. </p>
<p>The lower court correctly gave no credence to appellant's version, and 
accepted that of the prosecution. The theory of the defense is contradicted by 
the positive testimony of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Zamudio</span> to the 
effect that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was running away from <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> when the latter shot him (<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>), and we find no plausible reason to doubt the 
veracity of said witness for the prosecution, who was walking a few paces behind 
<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>, at the time of the occurrence. In fact, 
said testimony of <span class="SpellE">Zamudio</span> was partly corroborated by 
<span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>, who admitted having "heard Alfredo Es-<span class="SpellE">trelles</span> run towards his left side". </p>
<p>What is more, said theory is refuted by the location of the injuries found in 
the body of <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>. Indeed, the latter had two (2) 
bullet wounds: one, on the left side of his body, at about 15 centimeters below 
the left <span class="SpellE">axila</span>, and the other, at the right side of 
the middle part of his back. The prosecution believes that the latter, or the 
wound at the back, is the entry wound. Even, however, if the bullet had entered 
the body of <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> through its left side, under the 
<span class="SpellE">axilla</span> - as surmised in the certificate issued by the 
President of the Sanitary Division, who made an autopsy of said body, but, did 
not take the witness stand - this fact shows that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was not advancing towards <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> when the latter shot him, for otherwise the entry 
wound would have been on the anterior part of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> body, instead of at the left side thereof, below 
the left <span class="SpellE">axila</span>.</p>
<p>Contrary to the allegations in the information, we do not believe, however, 
that the crime committed is qualified by either evident premeditation or 
treachery. Manifestly, <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> had not acted with such 
premeditation in killing <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>, he (<span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>) having gone to the scene of the occurrence by order 
of his administrative superior, to disarm <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>. 
Neither was there treachery in the commission of the offense. Although, while 
running away, <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> had no means of defending 
himself, <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> did not purposely take advantage of 
this circumstance to kill him without any danger to himself (<span class="SpellE">Dadis</span>). <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> believed that <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> was armed with a gun, and the record strongly 
indicates that such was a fact, although it is certain that he (<span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span>) had not drawn it.</p>
<p>Obviously, <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> was merely scared, as well, 
perhaps, as somewhat trigger happy, for which reason, the offense committed is 
no more than homicide, and the penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, 
should be imposed in its medium period, no modifying circumstance having 
attended the perpetration of the offense.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from should be, as it is hereby 
modified, and another one shall be entered convicting appellant Manuel <span class="SpellE">Dadis</span> of the crime of homicide, and sentencing him to an 
indeterminate penalty from 10 years of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor 
to 17 years of reclusion temporal, with the corresponding accessory penalties, 
and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Estrelles</span> in the sum of P6,000, as well as to pay the 
costs.</p>
<p><b>IT IS SO ORDERED.</b></p>
