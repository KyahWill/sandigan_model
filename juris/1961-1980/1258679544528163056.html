</style><div class="Section1"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"><o:p></o:p></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Government has interposed a 
direct appeal against the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, in 
its Case No. 54611, ordering the Secretary of Finance, the Commissioner of 
Customs and the Customs Auditor to reinstate the private <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to their respective positions in the Customs 
Patrol Service, with payment of their back salaries, and ousting those who 
replaced them.<o:p></o:p></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Alleging that they were dismissed 
for lack of confidence, in violation of the law and the Constitution, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> Leon <span class="SpellE">Piñero</span>, et al., 
instituted mandamus proceedings in the court below against their replacements, 
the Commissioner of Customs, the Secretary of Finance and the Customs Auditor, 
to compel reinstatement to their positions in the Customs Patrol Service, with 
back salaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is virtually no controversy 
over the facts that gave rise to this proceeding. In his decision, the trial 
judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> M. Vazquez, summarized thus the 
stipulated facts in this case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"The thirty-two petitioners, at 
the time of their dismissal, were employees occupying positions in various 
capacities in the Port Patrol Division of the Bureau of Customs. With the 
exception of petitioners Jose Guerrero, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> 
Medrano and <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> Hernandez, they were holding their 
positions under permanent appointments. The petitioners have rendered services 
in the Bureau of Customs which ranged individually from two years to twenty-six 
years. They were all insured with the Government Service Insurance System. On 
various dates between the first week of December, 1962 up to the last week of 
January, 1963, the petitioners were ordered dismissed or separated from the 
Bureau of Customs by the respondent Acting Secretary of Finance and Acting 
Commissioner of Customs, based on the ground that said respondent had lost 
confidence in them. After their dismissal, the petitioners individually and 
collectively demanded in writing for their immediate reinstatement, but their 
demands were unheeded. Instead, the other respondents (except Rodrigo D. Perez, 
Jr. and the Auditor of the Bureau of Customs) were appointed in the positions 
previously held by the petitioners. On July 27, 1963, the petitioners filed this 
action before this Court."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The trial court held that under 
the Constitution (Article XII, section 4) as well as the Civil Service Law (Rep. 
Act No. 2260) the petitioners below (private respondents in this Court) could 
not be dismissed or removed from their positions without cause and due hearing 
even if their positions should be primarily confidential, as contended by the 
Customs and Finance authorities , because the Civil Service law at present 
protects not only those who belong to the classified service but also those in 
the unclassified service, that include positions primarily confidential, policy 
determining or highly technical. It, therefore, rendered judgment ordering the 
reinstatement of petitioners with payment of back salaries and commanding those 
who replaced them in their respective positions to vacate and surrender the same 
to the claimants, since these replacements were "illegally appointed to 
positions which were not vacant".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The State then duly brought the 
case to this Court by direct appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The principal issue posed is 
whether claimants may be dismissed without cause or hearing for mere lack of 
confidence, in view of the fact that the positions occupied by them in the 
Customs Patrol Service are "primarily confidential", having been so declared by 
Executive Order No. 397, series of 1941, and Executive Order No. 94, series of 
1947.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants buttress their claim 
upon the executive orders aforesaid. It is well to note, however, that while 
Executive Order No. 397, Series of 1941, declares that – <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"the appointment, promotion, 
discipline and removal of the members of the Harbor Police be subject only to 
the discretion of the appointing authority"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Executive Order No. 94, Series of 
1947, in its Section 53 and 54, merely provides: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'SEC. 53. There is hereby 
organized as "Customs Patrol Service" through the consolidation of the Secret 
Service Division and the Harbor Police Division, including the positions and 
personnel paid by the entity operating the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> 
service, to take direct charge of the enforcement of the laws and regulations 
within the customs premises and the port area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'SEC. 54. The positions in the 
Customs Patrol Service are hereby declared primarily confidential and 
appointments thereto will be subject only to the discretion of the Secretary of 
Finance.’", <o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">without, therefore, reiterating 
the former Executive Order (397) that (besides appointment) their discipline and 
removal would be, likewise, at the discretion of the Secretary of Finance. 
Appellants, however, maintain that the Executive Order (No. 397) supplements the 
deficiency in the latter one (No. 94, series of 1947), and that in not so 
holding the trial court committed error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We do not find it necessary to 
resolve this particular issue, because of the more fundamental reason that, 
under Section 5 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 now in force, what determines 
ultimately whether an administrative position is primarily confidential, policy 
determining or highly technical, is the nature of the functions attached to the 
position. This clearly appears from the wording and history of section 5 of the 
1959 Civil Service Act (R. A. 2260), which recites:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 5.<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> The Non-competitive Service.</span></em> - The 
non-competitive or unclassified service shall be composed of positions expressly 
declared by law to be in the non-competitive or unclassified service or those 
which are policy determining, primarily confidential or highly technical in 
nature." (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Act's legislative history 
reveals that while Senate Bill No. 133 (that ultimately became Republic Act 
2260) was being debated in the Senate, Section 5 originally provided as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 5. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Non-competitive Service</span></em>. - The 
non-competitive or unclassified service shall be composed of positions expressly 
declared by law to be in the non-competitive or unclassified service or to be 
policy determining , primarily confidential, or highly technical in nature." 
(Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The change from the original 
wording of the bill (expressly declared by law . . . . . . . . . . to be policy 
determining, etc.) to that finally approved and enacted ("or which are policy 
determining, etc. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">in nature"</span></em>) 
came about because of the observations of Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, that as originally worded the proposed bill gave 
Congress power to declare by <i>fiat of law</i> a certain position as primarily 
confidential or policy determining, which should not be the case. The Senator 
urged that since the Constitution speaks of positions which are "primarily 
confidential, policy determining or highly technical in nature"<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>, it is not within the power of Congress 
to declare what positions are primarily confidential or policy determining. "It 
is the<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> nature</span></em> alone of the 
position that determines whether it is policy determining or primarily 
confidential." Hence, the Senator further observed, the matter should be left to 
the "proper implementation of the laws, depending upon the nature of the 
position to be filled", and if the position is "highly confidential" then the 
President and the Civil Service Commissioner must implement the 
law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">To a question of Senator <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, "But in positions that involved both confidential 
matters and matters which are routine, . . . . . . . . who is going to determine 
whether it is primarily confidential?" Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> 
replied:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">“’SENATOR TAÑADA: Well, at the 
first instance, it is the appointing power that determines that: the nature of 
the position. In case of conflict then it is the Court that determines whether 
the position is primarily confidential or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"'I remember a case that has been 
decided by the Supreme Court involving the position of a district engineer in 
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, and there, precisely, the nature of the 
position was in issue. It was the Supreme Court that passed upon the nature of 
the position, and held that the president could not transfer the district 
engineer in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> against his consent.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">'</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, therefore, proposed an amendment to section 5 of the 
bill, deleting the words "to be" and inserting in lieu thereof the words 
"Positions which are by their nature" policy determining, etc., and deleting the 
last words "in nature". Subsequently, Senator Padilla presented an amendment to 
the <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> amendment by adopting the very words of the 
Constitution, i.e., "those which are policy determining, primarily confidential 
and highly technical in nature". The Padilla amendment was adopted, and it was 
this last wording with which section 5 was passed and was enacted (Senate 
Journal, May 10, 1959, Vol. 11, No. 32, pp. 679-681).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It is plain that, at least since 
the enactment of the 1959 Civil Service Act (R. A. 2260), it is the nature of 
the position which finally determines whether a position is primarily 
confidential, policy determining or highly technical. Executive pronouncements 
can be no more than initial determinations that are not conclusive in case of 
conflict. And it must be so, or else it would then lie within the discretion of 
the Chief Executive to deny to any officer, by executive fiat, the protection of 
section 4, Article XII, of the Constitution.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Now, the record is devoid of data 
as to the functions discharged by the members of the Port Patrol, other than 
they are part of the Customs police forces. But this fact does not by itself 
indicate that the position is primarily confidential, so as to dispense with 
security of tenure for the incumbents. In De <span class="SpellE">los</span> 
Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, 87 Phil. 289, this Court, in 
holding that the position of City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> 
was not a primarily confidential one, reasoned as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"Every appointment implies 
confidence, but much more than ordinary confidence is reposed in the occupant of 
a position that is primarily confidential. The latter phrase denotes not only 
confidence in the aptitude of the appointee for the duties of the office but 
primarily close intimacy which insures freedom of intercourse without 
embarrassment or freedom from misgivings of betrayals of personal trust or 
confidential matters of state" (<span class="SpellE">Cas</span>. cit. at p. 
298).<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">As previously pointed out, there 
are no proven facts to show that there is any such close Intimacy and trust 
between the appointing power and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> as 
would support a finding that confidence was the primary reason for the existence 
of the positions held by them or for their appointment thereto. Certainly, it is 
extremely improbable that the service demands any such close trust and intimate 
relation between the appointing official and, not one or two members alone but 
the entire Customs Patrol (Harbor Police) force, so that every member thereof 
can be said to hold "primarily confidential" posts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We are thus compelled to conclude 
that the positions formerly held by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were not 
primarily confidential in nature, so as to make their terms of office 
co-terminal with the confidence reposed in them. The inevitable corollary is 
that respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, Leon <span class="SpellE">Piñero</span>, et al., were not subject to dismissal or removal, 
except for cause specified by law and with due process (Civil Service Law, 
Republic Act 2260, section 32). Hence, the court below committed no error in 
holding that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> could not be legally separated 
from the service for mere lack of confidence, the same not being one of the 
causes for removal mentioned in section 33 of the Civil Service 
Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Nor do we find tenable the 
contention of appellants that removal of petitioners is discretionary in the 
Secretary of Finance because it is so provided in Executive Order No. 397, 
Series of 1941, that supplements the subsequent Executive Order No. 94, Series 
of 1947, Section 53, the latter being silent on the manner of removing Customs 
Patrol (ex-Harbor Police) officers. The reason is not only that Executive Order 
No. 94, Series of 1947, was issued pursuant to the Reorganization Act of 1946 
(Republic Act No. 51),specifically enacted for the organization of the 
Administrative services of the independent Republic, and, therefore, it 
necessarily superseded Executive Order No. 397, Series of 1941, that only 
envisaged the services under the Commonwealth, but also because the 1941 order 
appears predicated upon Section 671, paragraph 1, of the Administrative Code 
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span>, and the latter section was among 
those expressly repealed by Section 45 of the Civil Service Law of 1959. Even 
assuming, therefore, that Executive Order No. 94, Series of 1947, is still in 
force, the discretionary removal of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> is not 
authorized by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The appellants argue that 
respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein do not possess civil 
service eligibility appropriate for the positions they were holding. But this 
question was not invoked in petitioners' answer in the court below, and hence 
can not be raised for the first time on appeal. Besides, the parties expressly 
stipulated that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> (with the exception of Jose 
Guerrero, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> Medrano and <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> Hernandez) were issued permanent appointments, and 
the presumption of regularity applies to them. Even in the case of those holding 
provisional or probationary appointments (like the three above-named) the 
invalidity thereof can not be declared unless it is first shown that there were 
appropriate <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span> at the time they were appointed, 
and this requisite has not been established by evidence (Civil Service Rule VI, 
sections 13 and 14).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 13. Whenever a vacancy 
occurs and the filling thereof is necessary in the interest of the service and 
in the findings of the Commissioner there is no appropriate eligible at the time 
of appointment, the appointing officer may, upon prior authorization of the 
Commissioner, Provincial or City Treasurer, as the case may be, issue a 
provisional appointment to a person who has not qualified in an appropriate 
examination but who otherwise meets the requirements for appointment to a 
regular position in the competitive or classified service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 14. A provisional 
appointment shall in no case extend beyond 30 days from receipt by the 
appointing officer of the certification of <span class="SpellE">eligibles</span>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In view of the deficiencies of 
the record, and the failure in the answer to properly tender issue on these 
points, it is our opinion that the matter of eligibility should be threshed out 
in an appropriate proceeding, giving all parties ample opportunity to litigate 
their respective contentions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Appellants, likewise, aver that 
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to 
claim dismissal without just cause and hearing, because they accepted 
appointment and assumed their positions under Executive Order No. 397, series of 
1941, declaring their positions to be primarily confidential. But assuming that 
such declaration was constitutional and valid, the subsequent 1959 Civil Service 
Law determined the character of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' tenure 
according to the nature of the position itself, and we fail to see how <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> could operate to deprive <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> of the benefits accorded by this subsequent 
statute, particularly when the law itself prohibits waiver of any right or 
rights accruing under the law to the civil service employee. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"SEC. 40. <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Waiver of Rights.</span></em> - No public officer 
or employee acting for a public officer shall be permitted to require an 
applicant for employment or any employee to sign any paper or document whereby 
such applicant for employment waives any right or rights accruing to him under 
this law."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The final contentions are 
procedural. Petitioners Insist that the National Treasurer is an indispensable 
party to this action, since <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> claimed payment 
of back salaries; and that these proceedings are in fact a suit against the 
government, not maintainable without its consent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">We find these contentions of 
appellants untenable. The payment of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' back 
salaries is purely incidental to the main question relative to the legality of 
their ouster, and would be a mere consequence of a declaration that the same was 
illegal. It nowhere appears that the Insular Treasurer has objected to paying 
the back salaries of <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> herein in the event it 
should be declared by the courts that they were illegally dismissed; nor does it 
appear that such salaries are not, or have not been, included and appropriated 
in the yearly budgets enacted by the Legislature and approved by the President 
of the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">It was pointed out in State 
Mineral Lease Commission vs. Lawrence, 157 So. 897 (quoted with approval in 
Ruiz, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabahug</span>, et al., 54 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., No. 2, pp.351, 354), that the cases wherein the rule 
of state immunity from suit has been applied and upheld are: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"<span class="SpellE">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> those which demanded a 
money judgment, and wherein the discharge of the judgment, if obtained, would 
require the appropriation or an expenditure <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, 
which being legislative in its character is a province exclusively of the 
political departments of the state. And in the less frequent number of cases 
where no money judgment is demanded, and the rule of immunity is still upheld, 
it will be found in them that the relief demanded would be, nevertheless, to 
require of the state or its political subdivision the affirmative performance of 
some asserted obligation, the nature of which, and the process of its discharge 
belong to the state in its political 
capacity.’"<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">None of these circumstances 
obtains in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
