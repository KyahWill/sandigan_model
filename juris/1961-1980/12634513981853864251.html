<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, the bank may not be considered a

consonance with the doctrine enunciated by the Supreme Court, to wit:</p>

of a defect or lack of title in his vendor cannot claim that he has acquired
title thereto in good faith as against the true owner of the land of an
interest therein; and the same rule must be applied to one who has knowledge of
facts which should have put him upon such inquiry and investigation as might be
necessary to acquaint him with the defects in the title of his vendor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>purchaser
cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man upon his
guard, and the claim that he acted in good faith under the belief that there
was no defect in the title of the vendor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His mere refusal to believe that such defect exists, or his willful
closing of his eyes to the possibility of the existence of a defect in his
vendor's title, will not make him an innocent purchaser for value, if it
afterwards develops that the title was in fact defective, and it appears that
he had such notice of the defect as would have led to its discovery had he
acted with that measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a
prudent man in a like situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
