<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Two criminal cases against 
petitioners are before this Court for review on certiorari: The first, a 
violation of Section 2703, Revised Administrative Code [fraudulent practice 
against customs revenues (smuggling)]; and, the second, a violation of Article 
192, Revised Penal Code [illegal importation of prohibited drugs (opium)]. The

guilty on both counts. The sentence against each: For smuggling (violation of 
Section 2703, Revised Administrative Code), "an indeterminate penalty ranging 
from a minimum of not less than 1 year imprisonment (no maximum provided) and to 
pay a fine of P2,000 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency"; and, 
for illegal importation of opium (violation of Article 192, Revised Penal Code), 
"an indeterminate penalty ranging from a minimum of 1 year and 1 day to a 
maximum of 3 years, 6 months and 21 days of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> 
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span> and to pay a fine of P2,000, with 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency." On appeal, the Court of Appeals 
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" style1=""><span class="style2style1"><sup><span style="font-family: Verdana;">[2]</span></sup></span><sup></sup></span> voted to affirm, 
except for the smuggling case where an indeterminate prison term "consisting of 
a minimum of not less than six (6) months and a maximum of not more than two (2) 
years" was imposed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The undisputed facts 
are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Sometime in March, 1955, 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang, a merchant with an annual 
allocation of $1,000.00, opened a letter of credit with the China Banking 
Corporation for $100.00 to be used for the importation of "joss" papers from 
<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>. In accordance with the accepted firm offer 
and the letter of credit, a bill of lading covering "joss" papers contained in 
four bales was sent to, and received by, <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang from 
the shipper. Bee <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> Hong in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">On March 16, 1955, a shipment of 
four bales supposedly consisting of "joss" papers, bearing identification mark 
"BTC" and consigned to <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang, was unloaded in the 
Port of Manila from the steamer "S/S <span class="SpellE">Schwabenstein</span>" 
which came from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>. The shipment was placed 
under customs' custody pending release in due course to the 
consignee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After arrival of the bales 
above-mentioned, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Kim <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span>, in representation of consignee <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang, submitted to the Bureau of Customs the necessary 
documents for the release of the shipment, which was later given Entry No. 
23450. These documents consisted of the permit to deliver the imported goods; 
the importer's declaration for advance payment of sales tax; the official 
receipt of cash deposit made to cover the estimated taxes; the release 
certificate from the Central Bank through the China Banking Corporation as 
agent; the bill of lading; the commercial invoices; and the Customs Consumption 
Entry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Prior to the arrival of the 
shipment, there had been reports of illegal importation of dutiable merchandise. 
Said shipment was, consequently, subjected to rigid inspection. Instead of 
examining the bales at the pier where they were unloaded, the customs 
authorities decided to inspect them thoroughly at the Parcel Section. Upon 
opening the four bales -by a committee composed of Customs Examiner <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, Chief Appraiser <span class="SpellE">Aceron</span>, 
Deputy Collector <span class="SpellE">Millares</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rizalino</span> de Guzman of the Port Terminal Secret Service, in 
the presence of other persons - it was found that two of the bales, Nos. 3 and 
4, had holes in the center, 1/2 foot square (6x6 inches) and about 1 foot deep. 
In bale No. 3, twenty-two packages containing ladies' and men's watches of 
different makes, together with stainless steel and gold-filled bracelets and 
watch crowns, were found, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>: 2,860 watches for men 
and ladies; 973 gold-filled watch crowns, and 2,400 gold-filled and stainless 
bracelets for men's and ladies' watches. In bale No. 4, 170 tins of opium (Dog 
Brand) were discovered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The tins of opium were submitted 
for analysis to the National Bureau of Investigation. Its chemist, Lorenzo A. 
<span class="SpellE">Sunico</span>, selected at random several tins from the six 
packages submitted to him, found that the contents thereof were 
opium.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Ang</span></span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Kim <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> - who submitted the papers for the release of the four 
bales of supposed "joss" papers - was investigated. His statement was taken down 
in writing. There, he stated that he is a cousin of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang who resides at 503 <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> 
St.; that the negotiable bill of lading was among the papers signed by him and 
submitted to the Bureau of Customs for the release of the four bales. In none of 
these papers were the goods in question declared. Only "joss" papers in four 
packages were mentioned. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang, however, asserted 
that he did not order them. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Kim <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> testified that he took steps to have the goods 
released; that he was not able to do so as he was informed on March 23, 1955 by 
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aceron</span>, Chief Appraiser, that they would not be 
released; that he informed <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang about the matter, 
but that the latter did not do anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">1. Our inquiry is mainly directed 
at the question of whether the People had discharged its heavy burden. And this, 
on the face of petitioners' disclaimer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">But the facts just recited - 
without more - will support the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that "[N]o 
one else in the whole world could have ordered them to be shipped to 
Manila"<span class="style11">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span><span class="style2style1"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> Because there is no point in petitioners' averment 
that the innocuous documents show only an importation of "joss" papers. For, 
documents would not recite the clandestinely imported goods. These are, as here, 
ingeniously concealed with legally imported merchandise on the chance that the 
former could escape detection. Or, if discovered, the importer could, by 
improper methods, obtain delivery thereof just the same. Smugglers thrive on 
their wits. Neither will it profit petitioners to throw the burden of illegal 
shipment on their shipper. Reason: the shipper will not include it unless 
ordered and paid; or, unless a secret understanding was had between him and the 
local importer. Those undeclared goods could not have been planted either. The 
value thereof leaves us unwilling to accept that a racketeer mixed them with the 
genuinely imported "joss" papers. Unless, of course, an unholy alliance existed 
between him and petitioners. So much is to be risked for so uncertain a 
result.</span></span></span><span class="style2style1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Here is the picture that the 
record projects: <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang is the importer. The bales, 
in which the smuggled items were discovered, were consigned to him. Previous 
reports of illegal importation of dutiable merchandise reached the authorities. 
The other petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Kim <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span>, is a longtime employee and cousin of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Fang. The two <span class="SpellE">Angs</span> are both 
interested in the release because they imported the goods. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Kim <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> pressed for the 
immediate release of the goods. When told that the bales would undergo rigid 
inspection at the Parcel Office, petitioners shied away; they did not appear at 
the scheduled examination, despite the fact that both were duly notified 
thereof. They did not bother to procure delivery of the joss papers, did not 
even as much as inquire about the cause for refusal to release them; and this, 
in spite of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Kim <span class="SpellE">Tiao</span> was at first insistent in prompt release. This pattern 
of conduct does not comport with petitioners' claim that they are ignorant of 
the clandestine shipment and that they are but victims of an ingenious plot 
concocted by others. Correctly, as the Court of Appeals observed, "[I]t would be 
sheer <span class="SpellE">naivete</span>' if not pure infantilism of thought to 
accept their pretensions"<span class="style11">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">2. Next, we address ourselves to 
the penalty. That imposed by the courts below for the illegal importation of 
opium is fair. For the crime of fraudulent practice against customs revenues 
(Section 2703, Revised Administrative Code), we feel that we should - under the 
Indeterminate Sentence Act - elevate the minimum of the penalty to the level set 
by the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Wherefore, the judgment under 
review is modified in the sense that, for the violation of Section 2703 of the 
Revised Administrative Code, petitioners are hereby sentenced each to 
imprisonment for an indeterminate period ranging from one (1) year to two (2) 
years<span class="style11">,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span> and to pay a fine of Two 
Thousand Pesos (f 2,000), with the corresponding subsidiary <span class="SpellE">subsidiary</span> imprisonment. In all other respects, said 
judgment is affirmed. Costs against petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
