				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners seek the review and reversal of the decision of the
Court of Appeals, in its Case CA-GR No. 32290-R, reversing the one rendered <span style="">in their favor by the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> in Civil Case No. 2729.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="2">12 February 1960</st1:date>,
petitioners commenced a <span style="">suit in </span>the
court of origin, seeking to quiet title to a parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Nalibunan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, described in the complaint and covered
by Tax Declara­tion No. 565; to recover the same from private respondents
herein and to collect damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
pleadings of the parties it can be gathered that both sides claim title from
the late <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>;
but while plaintiffs predicate their ownership as successors of <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, who acquired
the land from <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> by succession and purchase of
the shares of her coheirs, defendants, in turn, asserted that four heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cirpriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, to wit, <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> (one of
plaintiffs), <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>,
defendant Mariano <span class="SpellE">Reas</span> and Norberto <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> (deceased husband of defendant Paula <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>) had verbally
partitioned the land in question in 1938, the other heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> having received other properties; that each <span class="SpellE">partitioner</span> had since then possessed his respective share
as exclusive owner, the oral partition having been ra­tified in writing in
1949.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendants further pleaded
title by adverse possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance upheld the contentions of plaintiffs
(petitioners in the case before us) because of a decision in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, rendered by the
Court of Land Registration in <span class="SpellE">Tac­loban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, in its Case No. 235, which decision was rendered on
21 June 1937, and of the sale by heirs of <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> of
their interest in favor of coheir Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>,
petitioners' predecessor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
adjudged petitioners to be the owners of the disputed land, and ordered
defendants (now respondents) to restore possession and pay P20.00 a month until
actual return of the land to plaintiffs, plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon appeal duly interposed, the Court of Appeals reversed the
Court of First Instance on the basis that the decision in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> was not entered or transcribed in the manner
provided <span style="">in </span>Section 41 of the
Land Registration Act (Act 496) and no decree nor certificate of title was ever
issued, hence <span class="SpellE">Cipriana's</span> title to the land did not
become indefeasible or <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"The decision in the land registration case (G. L. R. O.
Record No. 51534) rendered on June 21, 1937 adjudicating the whole area <span style="">in </span>favor of <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> <span style="">is
unavailing. -------- </span>Said<span style=""> </span>decision
lost its vigor and enforceability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although it became final, the same was not executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no final decree entered neither a
certificate of title issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
</span>nothing but a statement of the facts of the case and the law ap<span style="">plicable thereto.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">--------</span><span style=""> Inasmuch as the
time within which it could have been enforced had long expired 'the judgment is
not merely dormant but dead.' </span><span style="">--------</span><span style=""> It did never toll or suspend the running of
the prescriptive period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In com­puting
the period of adverse possession of land, the time of <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of any abandoned, or otherwise discontinued action in respect thereto is to be
treated as though such action had never been ins­tituted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[3]</span></span></a><span style=""> --------“</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">With respect to the second issue of
prescription, the Court of Appeals found that -<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Defendants-appellants <span style="">have
proven preponderantly that they have </span><span style="">been in actual, </span>open,
public, continuous possession under claim of exclusive ownership over the land
in question for more than 10 years before the instant suit was lodged in the <span style="">court below.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Such possession has ripened <span style="">into ownership </span>by and through prescription."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[4]</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In arriving at the aforesaid conclusion,
the Appellate Court observed that plaintiffs' cause of action commenced to run
from 1940 upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> from whom plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayot</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>-Ramirez derived their title of ownership to the
land.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[5]</span></span></a> It found proved that after the death of <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span>, the persons "who appeared to have taken
possession of the land" left by her were <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rufino</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>
and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Reas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><u>Eustaquio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>-Ramirez
did not exercise any right of possession and ownership over their supposed
shares.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[6]</span></span></a><span style=""> It was likewise found that </span>as early
as 1948, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> leased his share <span style="">in the partition to </span>third persons <span style="">where </span>a sawmill and lumberyard were
installed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
was an instrumental witness to the lease contract.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[7]</span></span></a> On <st1:date year="1949" day="12" month="10">12 October 1949</st1:date>, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Reas</span>, <span style="">Norberto and</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> ratified or
confirmed in a public instrument their long time possession by partitioning the
land among themselves into four (4) parts, with <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> <span style="">taking
two shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These portions were
subsequently </span>declared for taxation purposes and this fact was admitted
by the plaintiffs in the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[8]</span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> has been an
occupant and possessor of his shares of the land (Lots 2 and <span style="">7, Exhibit "13").</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[9]</span></span></a> When these lands were traversed by municipal
roads later, it <span style="">was </span>to these
persons, among others as recognized owners, that com­pensation was paid for the
right-of-way secured <span style="">by the Municipal </span>Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-petitioners do not question <span style="">in this </span>instance the correctness of the finding of the Court of
Appeals that the <span style="">decision </span>in favor
of their predecessor, <span class="SpellE">Cipriana</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>,
albeit rendered in a land registration c<span style="">ase,
acquired no greater force than an ordinary judgment and could be defeated by
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in the absence of
proper entry of judgment and a decree of registration the land involved did not
become registered land, is clear from the provisions of sections 41, 45 and 46
of the Land Registration law (Act 496).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But petitioners vigorously challenge the holding that the defendant
acquired ownership by adverse possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the Court of Appeals upon this issue, that de­fendants
ever since 1949 held the land as exclusive owners, and exercised acts of
dominion thereon, while petitioners never had possession thereof, are findings
of fact that are binding upon this Court, whose jurisdiction in this class of
cases is limited to reviewing errors of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 1116 of the New Civil Code, prescription already
running before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code shall be
governed by the laws previously in force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this particular case, the law applicable <span style="">is the Code of Civil Procedure, specifically Sections 40 and 41
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals having
ruled that defendants-appellants had been in possession of the land adversely,
continuously and in the concept of owners since 1949, at least, they have
acquired title over the land through acquisitive prescription, pursuant to
Section 41 which reads -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Title to land by prescription.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Ten years actual adverse possession by any
person claiming to be owner for that time of any land or interest in land,
uninterruptedly continued for ten years by occupancy, descent, grants, or
otherwise, <u>in whatever way such occupancy may have commenced or continued,
shall vest in every actual occupant or possessor of such land a full and
complete title</u>, saving to the person under disabilities the rights secured
by the next section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to
constitute such title by prescription or adverse possession, the possession by<span style=""> the claimant or by the person under or
through whom he claims must be <u>actual, open, public, continuous, under a
claim of title exclusive of any other right and adverse to all other claimants</u>
. . . . . . . . . . .</span><span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[10]</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Prescription lies under the said section even in the absence of
good faith and just title.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the contention that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Reas</span>
could not acquire a portion of the property covered by Tax Declaration No.
11592 (Exhibit "H") for the reason that he <span style="">was </span>merely an administrator thereof, the Court of Appeals ruled
that "we find the same both <u>factually</u> and legally impossible"
(Resolution on Motion to Reconsider, Annex "C" of Petition, page 7);
and added -</p>

<blockquote>"But under the circumstances, such relationship had been
repudiated long ago by Mariano <span class="SpellE">Reas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He was in exclusive possession of the land
in the concept of an owner as previously shown.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No fruit nor moiety of the produce of the land was given to anyone who
claimed to have appointed him to administer the property consisting of only 1926
hectare of land</u> - - - - - - - - - -."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[11]</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court went on further to say that if
an administrator repudiates his representative capacity, at least in so far as
the land in dispute is concerned, and sets up an independent, exclusive, and
hostile right in himself, openly and notoriously, his possession may become
adverse to the heirs or devisees of the estate, providing, of course, that they
are under no disability,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[12]</span></span></a> and it
found plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayot</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>-Ramirez to be under no disability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the decision of the trial court was reversed by the Court
of Appeals and the complaint was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A motion for reconsideration was filed by the plaintiffs but the same
was denied in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="11">9
 November 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion reads -</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, we are of the considered view that,
while we do not agree with the original findings of this Court that appellants
have been in the adverse possession of the land in question even before 1937
when the said land was the subject of <span style="">a </span>decision in a land registration case, <u>we
still find that the action of plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
as held in the previous decision of this Court, has long prescribed and that
appellants have acquired ownership of the land in question by acquisitive
prescription, having been in adverse possession of the same for more than ten
(10) years</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
reconsideration is hereby denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[13]</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts and the law on which the decision is based have been
clearly and distinctly set forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
findings, of facts are supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The extra-judicial partition of <st1:date year="1949" day="12" month="10">12 October 1949</st1:date> can hardly be
disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the
complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[14]</span></span></a> <span style="">and, therefore, admitted as such.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[15]</span></span></a><span style=""> T</span><span style="">he <span style="">admission of its </span></span><span style="">existence, although the partition is </span><span style="">branded as <span style="">unlawful, binds </span></span><span style="">the
petitioners in so far as their </span><span style="">knowledge
of the same <span style="">is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="">It was precisely that </span><span style="">knowledge which made them file the action to quiet </span><span style="">the title to, and be declared </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">sole and <span style="">exclusive </span></span><span style="">owners </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the land described in the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by the petitioners that <span style="">they discovered </span><span style="">this </span><span style="">parti­</span><span style="">tion, </span>and specifically the perfidy <span style="">of administrator Mariano <span class="SpellE">Reas</span>,
only in </span>February, 1960 as a result of <span style="">which the complaint was filed on </span><st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="2">12 February 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as the Court <span style="">of Appeals correctly found, this </span>is
belied by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alvero</span></span><span style="">, who is one of
petitioners-­</span>plaintiffs, was even a party and signatory to the <st1:date year="1949" day="12" month="10"><span style="">12 October 1949</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>extra-judicial
partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requisites for <span style="">acquisitive
prescription </span>under Section 41, Act 190, were found <span style="">to have been
complied with </span>when the Court of Appeals concluded that
"defendants-a<span style="">ppellants</span> <span style="">have </span>proven
preponderantly that they have been <span style="">in actual, open, public, </span><span style="">continuous possession </span>under claim of
exclusive <span style="">title
of ownership over </span>the land in question for more than 10 <span style="">years before </span><span style="">the instant </span><span style="">suit w</span><span style="">as </span>lodged - - - - - - -.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">possession has ripened into ownership </span>by and
through prescription."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[16]</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 41, Act 190, makes it clear that the <span style="">ten-year
prescriptive </span>period may be had "in whatever way <span style="">such</span><span style=""> <span style="">occupancy
may have commenced </span></span>or continued".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, even if appellants <span style="">should have sold a
piece of </span>the land previously, such sale <span style="">will not bar their right to set up adverse </span>possession
for themselves over the <span style="">same property partitioned by them </span>later as long as the conditions <span style="">specified in
Section 41 are shown to </span>exist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These conditions were found by <span style="">the Ap</span><span style="">p<span style="">ellate Court to have been </span></span>complied
with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further claim that <span style="">certain exhibits have been tampered </span>with
or falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, this Court <span style="">is urged to examine
and weigh </span>the documentary evidence <span style="">presented by</span><span style=""> </span>the p<span style="">a<span style="">rties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santa </span><span style="">Ana</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span>Jr., vs. Hernandez,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[17]</span></span></a> it was
held <span style="">by this </span><span style="">C<span style="">ourt
that </span></span>the credibility <span style="">of </span>witnesses and the weighing of <span style="">conflicting</span><span style=""> <span style="">evidence
are matters within </span></span>the exclusive authority of the Court of <span style="">Appeals, and it is
not necessarily </span>bound by the <span style="">conclusions of </span><span style="">the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision went further </span>to state
that barring a showing that the <span style="">findings
complained of </span>are totally devoid of support in the record, <span style="">or that </span><span style="">they are </span>so glaringly erroneous as to constitute a serious <span style="">abuse </span>of discretion, such findings
must stand, for the <span style="">Supreme Court is
not expected </span>or required to examine and <span style="">contrast the oral and documentary evi</span>dence submitted by the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">law creating the Court </span><span style="">of
Appeals </span>was intended mainly to take away from the Supreme Court the work
<span style="">of examining the evidence and confine
its task for the </span><span style="">determination
of </span><span style="">questions which do not call
for the reading and study of transcripts containing the testimony of
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Fortus</span>
</span><span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Novero</span>,</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[18]</span></span><span style=""> it was
likewise ruled by the Supreme Court that where the query necessarily invites
calibration of the whole evidence, </span><span style="">considering mainly </span>the credibility of witnesses, existence and <span style="">relevancy of specific surrounding
circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole and the
probabilities of the situation, the question must be <u>factual</u> for the
Appeals Court to solve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
