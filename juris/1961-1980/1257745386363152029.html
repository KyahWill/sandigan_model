				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order granting several motions to dismiss and, accordingly, 
dismissing plaintiffs' complaint, with costs against the latter.
<p>In said complaint, plaintiffs—numbering 67—allege that they are occupants 
and/or owners of residential lots, situated in Tatalon, Matalahib and Masambong, 
Quezon City, purchased by them from several persons named in said pleading and 
collectively designated therein as Deudors; that said residential lots are 
covered by a Torrens title in the name of J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc.; that by 
virtue of a compromise agreement dated March 16, 1953, the Deudors sold, 
transferred and conveyed to J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, 
Inc. a parcel of land of 50 "quiñones", including said residential lots occupied 
and/or owned by plaintiffs, for a valuable consideration stated in said 
agreement; that despite the recognition therein of the rights of the Deudors—and 
hence, of those of plaintiffs herein, as successors and assigns of the 
Deudors—in and to said residential lots, the aforementioned J.M. Tuason &amp; 
Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. instituted, in the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal, Quezon City Branch, numerous suits against the plaintiffs to eject 
them from said residential lots; and that, as a consequence of these suits, said 
corporations contemplate and threaten, unless restrained by a writ of 
preliminary injunction, to proceed with the ejectment proceedings and/or oust 
and force the plaintiffs to vacate the lots they had respectively purchased from 
the Deudors.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs prayed, therefore: a) that judgment be rendered: (1) declaring 
that they are entitled to enforce their respective contracts with the Deudors 
against said corporatfons, and, accordingly, to step into the shoes of the 
Deudors, in respect of the rights of the latter, under the aforementioned 
Compromise Agreement, with regard to the residential lots above referred to, and 
that said corporations cannot demand from plaintiffs payment of a price higher 
than that fixed in the contract between the latter and the Deudors or, else, 
that the increase in the price, if any, should be deducted from the amount due 
to the Deudors under said compromise agreement; and (2) ordering said 
corporations to execute the corresponding deeds of sale in favor of the 
plaintiffs; and b) that, meanwhile, said corporations and the Sheriff of Quezon 
City be enjoined fitom further proceedings in the aforementioned ejectment 
suits.</p>
<p>Soon after the filing of said complaint, plaintiffs filed an urgent <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> 
motion for a writ of preliminary injunction, to which the main defendants 
objected, and which was eventually denied by the lower court.</p>
<p>In due time, J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and Gregorio Araneta, Inc. filed 
separate motions to dismiss on various grounds, one of which was that venue had 
been improperly laid. These motions were granted upon the last ground, the 
residential lots in question not being located wholly or partly in the City of 
Manila. The order of the lower court to this effect is now assailed by 
plaintiffs-appellants upon two (2) grounds, namely: (1) that this is a personal 
action, for specific performance, which was properly instituted in Manila, where 
defendant corporations have their main offices; and (2) that venue had been 
waived by said defendants.</p>
<p>There is no merit in this pretense. Plaintiffs' action is predicated upon the 
theory that they "are occupants, landholders", and "most" of them "owners by 
purchase" of the residential lots in question; that, in consequence of the 
compromise agreement adverted to above, between the Deudors and defendant 
corporations, the latter had acknowledged the right and title of the Deudors in 
and to said lots, and hence, the right and title of the plaintiffs, as 
successors in interest of the Deudors; that, by entering into said agreement, 
defendant corporations had, also, waived their right to invoke the 
indefeasibility of the Torrens title in favor of J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc.; 
and that defendants have no right, therefore, to oust plaintiffs from the lots 
respectively occupied by them and which they claim to be entitled to hold. 
Obviously, this action affects, therefore, not only the <i>possession</i> of 
real property, but, also, the <i>title</i> thereto. Accordingly, it should have 
been instituted in the Court of First Instance Of the Province of Rizal in which 
said property is situated (Rule 5, section 3, Rules of Court).</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' second argument is premised upon the allegation that in Civil 
Case No. 36303 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled "Philippine 
Sugar Estates Development Co., Ltd. vs. J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. and/or 
Gregorio Araneta, Inc.", which is allegedly, "similar and identical" to the 
case at bar, defendant corporations had not objected to the venue. Not being 
parties in said case No. 36303, it is obvious that plaintiffs herein cannot 
avail themselves of the waiver therein allegedly made by said corporations, 
which, at the first opportunity, have expressly objected to the venue in the 
present case.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs insist that the lower court should have issued the writ of 
preliminary injunction prayed for by them, but, the venue having been improperly 
laid, it is clear that plaintiffs' contention has no leg to stand on.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
plaintiffs-appellants. It is so ordered.</p> <i>Bengzon, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, 
Paredes, Dizon,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
