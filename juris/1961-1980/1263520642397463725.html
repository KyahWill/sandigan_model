				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Defendant Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> seeks the
reversal of a decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, on reasonable doubt, the accused PAN PROVO and
LEONARDO DAVID are ACQUITTED of the crime charged, with costs de officio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, PAN PROVO should not be re­leased
from detention because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Criminal
Case No. 2190 of this Court wherein the said accused is one-of those charged
for Murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With reference to LEONARDO
DAVID, his imme­diate release is ordered unless his confinement is warranted by
some other legal cause.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As for the accused JOSE MESINA, the Court finds him GUILTY of
the crime of Murder punishable under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and
he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>;
to indemnify the heirs of the victim <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano
in the amount of TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00); and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has imposed the penalty in its
medium period instead of the maximum penalty of death because the aggravating
circumstance of nighttime and use of superior strength alleged in the inform­ation
have already been absorbed in the qualifying circum­stance of treachery."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 9, 1958, shortly after dusk, <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
Serrano, a security guard of the Clark Field Air Base, was forcibly taken away
by five men from his guard post at Fish Hawk No. 1, locally known as "<span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>", at <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, where there is a cement vault, about 1-1/2 meters
by 2 meters at its base and about 2-1/2 meters in height, with an iron door
which is padlocked. There are electric wires, on top of the vault, connected
with the wirings running southward from wooden transmission posts on both sides
of said vault.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>His dead body was found, on October 11, 1958, in a sugarcane plantation
near a wooded area, known as <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bituka</span>, not far away from said post, with fractured
"cervical vertebrae, right mandible, and right <span class="SpellE">baso­frontal</span>
bones." On December 2, 1958, a complaint was filed accus­ing herein
appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, together with John Doe, Peter
Doe, Richard Doe and William Doe, of kidnapping with murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon there­after, the corresponding
information was filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
charging Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and Leonardo David, <u>alias</u>
<span class="SpellE">Benaring</span>, with the aforesaid crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still later, the information was amended to
include Pan Provo as one of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main evidence for the prosecution against <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
consisted of the testimonies of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Gil­bert,
<span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> and Emilio
Provo, and Exhibits C and E. The prosecution, likewise, introduced the
testimony, among others, of Ro­bert Armstrong, superintendent of the police, at
the Air Base, which is partly in Camp O'Donnell, province of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and partly in <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Armstrong testified that, in addition to a private road therein,
the Air Base used to maintain its communications with Camp O'Don­nell by radio,
as well as thru underground cables, about two (2) inches in diameter,
containing around 900 wires, for the protection of which and other property
within the base the U. S. Government had engaged as sentries the services of
former members of the Philippine Scouts and members of the Non-Christian tribe
known as "<span class="SpellE">Baluga</span>", among-whom was the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano, whose guard post was on a
small plateau, on top of a hill, about 600 feet high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early in 1958, the communication officer of
the Air Base had reported difficulty in communication, which was found to be
due to the disappear­ance of a portion of said cables, about 3 miles in length
- apart from the disappearance of bridges and culverts - owing, presumably to
pilferage. In the evening of October 9, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano, another <span class="SpellE">Baluga</span> sentry, reported that his
brother <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano had been missing from his
post at "<span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>", with his carbine, since <u>6:00
o'clock</u> that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day,
a posse searched in vain the vicinity of "<span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 11, 1958, the body of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> was found in a state of decay at <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bituka</span>, not far away from <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The carbine
and ammunition issued to him were missing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Armstrong further said that Pan Provo is another <span class="SpellE">Baluga</span>
chief in the region; that he (Armstrong) had seen Pan Provo and <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> together on several occasions; that Pan Provo and <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> are related to each other; and that once Pan Provo
asked him (Armstrong) to engage the services of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
as security guard.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano, Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
Gilbert and <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
that, on October 9, 1958, at about 9:00 a.m., <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, at <span class="SpellE">Baluga</span> Village, accompanied by a man whose face was partly
covered; that, presently, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Gilbert arrived,
also, at said house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, to ask for
some rice; that the three (3) visitors took their lunch in that house; that,
soon thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> urged <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
to let him get some "pipes", referring to the electric cable lines, guarded
by <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano near <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>,
within the Air Base; that <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> answered that he
could not grant <span class="SpellE">Mesina's</span> request because the
"pipes" (cables) belonged to the Americans; that, thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> remarked: "If you do not knew how to get along
with people, you will not live long"; that, later, at about 3:00 p. m., <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and the unknown man, who came with him, departed
stat­ing that they were in a hurry because they had companions waiting for them
at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>; that, just after sunset that evening, Benita
<span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> went to the post of her husband at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span> and gave him a flashlight he had bade her to bring;
that, soon after, five (5) men, four (4) of them masked, came; that the
unmasked man was <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, whom she knew long before,
and who asked a cig­arette from <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>; that, as
the latter extended his hand holding the cigarette, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
grabbed the rifle slang on his (<span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>') shoulder,
whereas the four (4) masked men held him, and, with the help of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, dragged him down the hill, and disappeared in the
darkness at the foot thereof; that she, thereupon, screamed for help; that as
her nephew <span class="SpellE">Berting</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>,
whose house was not far away, came, she bade him to inform her brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
had been kidnapped; that when <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano came,
later that evening, he found Benita crying miserably; that he gathered from her
that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> had been taken away by several men, and
since, in view of her condi­tion, he could not get from her the details of the
occurrence, he proceeded to the Air Base and reported the matter; that the offi­cer
then on duty therein told him (<span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>) to go home
and come back the next day with a search team, which he did; that upon learning
of the disappearance of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>, on October 10,
1958, <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>,
another security guard of the Air Base, went, with several persons, to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, where Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>
confirmed the news that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> had been kidnapped
by several persons and told him that one of them was Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>;
that, as <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> and others proceeded down the hill
to search for <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>, following the footprints
visible on the ground, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> came and joined the
search; that the afore­mentioned footprints led to a sugarcane field, at a
given point of which the footprints were divided into two (2) sets, one leading
to the left and another to the right; that when the search team was about to
take the latter direction, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> persuaded the
members of the Team to follow the footprints leading to the left; that, heeding
<span class="SpellE">Mesina's</span> advice, the search team followed this lead
but failed to locate <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>; that when the team,
together with <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, returned to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano was there; that Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> then said that <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
should not be allowed to go free "because he was the one who kidnapped my
husband"; that, thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> brought <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and the others to the office of the Provost Marshal;
and that, one Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, an officer therein,
referred them to Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>, upon the ground that
the event had taken place beyond his territorial jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an affidavit, Exhibit C, subscribed and sworn to before the
Justice of the Peace of Angeles, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Leonardo
David stated that, when he was about to fetch his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
in the vicinity of <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, early in the evening of
October 9, 1958, he met his brother, Federico David, alias "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>", who was accompanied by Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and Manuel Zamora, alias "<span class="SpellE">Maning</span>";
that "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>" bade him to join the group,
which he did, in going to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>; that as <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano refused to allow them passage therein,
"<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>" held <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>,
snatched his carbine, and, with the assistance of his companions, dragged him
away from his guard post; that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> was brought
to a place in <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bituka</span>,
under a big tree, where "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>" gave him
fist blows and then hit him on the head with the butt of the carbine taken away
from him; and that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> then fell down
unconscious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit E is the transcript of the testimony given by Emilio
Provo before Fiscal Fernando M. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, at the pre­liminary investigation conducted by the
latter, on July 16, 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emilio Provo
then testified, among other things, that <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> is
well known to him, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> having visited frequently
Emilio's father, Pan Provo; that in 1958, his father was engaged in supervising
the digging of cable lines and culverts and the dismantling of bridges in the
Clark Air Force Base - with the assistance of many persons, among them Emilio
Provo acid Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>; that the cables, culverts and
I-Beams thus obtained were sold to Domingo de Vera and a Chinaman in <span class="SpellE">Mabalacat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>; that on
October 9, 1958, just after twilight, Emilio and Pan Provo went to the house of
Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, whom the latter invited to go to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>; that on the way thereto, Federico David, alias
"<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>", and Leonardo David, alias "<span class="SpellE">Benaring</span>", joined them; that before reaching <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, Emilio's companions said that they would get <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano, the guard in that place, "because of
the tubes" they were taking "and that one that was enclosed in a tank
which were being guarded by <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano";
that as they reached. <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, Pan Provo called <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano; that as <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
stepped out of his guard post, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> wrested the
carbine slung on the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> shoulder; that Pan
Provo and Federico and Leonardo David helped <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
drag <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> down the hill; that, as <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> offered resistance, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
Pan Provo and Federico David <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> him at <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bituka</span>, where <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> was left, already dead; and that when they learned
that the body of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano was found sub­sequently,
Emilio Provo and Pan Provo fled to <span class="SpellE">Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE">Calara</span>, in the mountains.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although Emilio Provo admitted having given this testimony, he
denied, before the lower court, any knowledge about the truth thereof and
affirmed that he gave said testimony upon instructions of Angel <span class="SpellE">Manipon</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Panolapi</span>, who had
assured him that he would, thereafter, be free.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied having performed any of the acts imputed to him
by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense would,
also, have the Court believe that on October 9, 1958, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
was in his house at Barrio San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Bamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, up to 5:00 o'clock p. m.; that, after taking an
early dinner, he attended the religious service, which lasted up to 8:00 p. m.
, at the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>, to which he is af­filiated, in that barrio; that,
at about 8:30 p.m., he and Ruben Villas attended a barrio meeting called by
barrio lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>;
that, upon adjournment of the meeting, around 10:00 p. m. they returned to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and then went to bed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As indicated above, the trial court acquitted Pan Provo and
Leonardo David, upon the ground of reasonable doubt, but con­victed <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> of the crime of murder, and sentenced him accord­ingly,
whereupon <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> interposed the present appeal,
contending that the trial court erred: (1) in relying upon the testimony of
Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>; (2) in giving credence to the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Ser­rano, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span>
Gilbert and <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>;
(3) in admitting Exhibits C and E as evidence; and (4) in not believing the
evidence for the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assignment of error, the defense assails the
credibility of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu's</span> testimony, upon the
ground that she had given conflicting versions, in that at one time she said it
was dark, between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m., when her husband was taken away by several
men, one of whom was <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, and, at another time,
stated that the occurrence took place just after twilight, in a seeming effort
to explain how she could recognize said appel­lant; that in the evening of
October 9, 1958, she did not tell either her nephew <span class="SpellE">Berting</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> or her brother-in-law <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano, that she had recognized appellant among the kidnappers of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>; that she, likewise, failed to convey such
information to <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, as soon as he
arrived at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span> the next Morning, not even when <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> then showed up in that place; and that neither had
she revealed his participation in the commission of the crime charged, while
they were going to the office of the provost Marshal on October 10, 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>At the outset, it should
be noted that Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> is a mem­ber of the
Non-Christian tribe known as <span class="SpellE">Baluga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, she had grown up and lived in a
primitive condition, devoid of any education whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is illiterate and cannot read, not even a
time­piece.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
had been snatched by his kidnappers at 8:00 or 8:30 p. m., she explained that
this was a mere estimate of the time, which may be mistaken, and that the event
had hap­pened "just after twilight." It is well to remember, in this
con­nection, that, in response to her screams for help, her nephew <span class="SpellE">Berting</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> came; that she bade
<span class="SpellE">Berting</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> to forthwith
inform her brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, of the
kidnapping of <span class="SpellE">Matig­nas</span>; and that, after verifying
this fact, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano imme­diately reported to
the authorities that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> "had been missing
with his carbine since 1800 hours x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> 9 Oct. 58, " as recorded in the "Daily Journal
SPL Police Operation" of the Air Base.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano had
estimated the time of the dis­appearance of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
to be about <u>6 p.m</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that <span class="SpellE">Anas­tacio</span> is more enlightened than Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> and that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> had been
snatched from his post "just after twilight," there is every reason
to believe that <span class="SpellE">Anastacio's</span> estimate of the time of
the occur­rence is more accurate than that of his sister-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Benita testified that, at 5 p.m.,
she brought the dinner of <span class="SpellE">Matig­nas</span>, who, after
taking the same, bade her to bring his flashlight, whereupon she picked it up
at their hut, barely 70 meters away from <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, and
then brought the flashlight thereto, <u>at about 6 p.m</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The occurrence took place shortly thereafter.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, "<span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>" is in a
small plateau, then cleared of grass, on a hill about 600 feet in height.
Although, for lack of electric lights in the vicinity, it was already dark,
particularly at the foot of the hill, it is a fact that <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>
was at the top there­of; that twilight had been over only shortly before; that
the hut of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> and Benita was barely 70 meters
away from Pisok;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
that Benita's eyesight had already been adjusted to the existing conditions
when" she went to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span> bringing a flashlight to
<span class="SpellE">Matig­nas</span>; that her ability to see an recognize
persons and objects was enhanced by the circumstance that she had been with <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> seve­ral minutes before the arrival of his
kidnappers; that the glow of the light at the Air Base proper, although 5 to 6
kilometers or miles away, rendered the top of the hill, where <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span> was, less dark than the area at the foot thereof; and
that she was beside her husband when the malefactors snatched him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied that the surrounding
circumstances were not such as to render it impossible, or even improbable, for
Benita to identify a person whom she knew well, like <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
had he been with the kidnappers, unmasked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
learned from Benita, on October 10, 1958, that she had recognized <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> among the offenders, the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>-testified
that, in a conversation he had with her on October 10, 1958, Benita said she
had recognized one of the kidnappers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benita had no possible reason to inculpate him - if he were not really
the unmasked kid­napper - and thereby exculpate the true culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us now consider appellant's argument based upon Benita's
failure to forthwith reveal the participation of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
in the commission of the crime. It will be recalled that, as soon as <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> and his kidnappers had disappeared in the darkness
at the foot of the hill, Benita hurried down another part of the hill, screaming
for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, soon thereafter, her
nephew <span class="SpellE">Berting</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
appeared, she bade him to inform <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano
that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> had been kidnapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not tell <span class="SpellE">Berting</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> the details of the occurrence, for there was
vital urgency of res­cuing <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> and, hence, she
did not wait for <span class="SpellE">Berting</span> to ap­proach her, but
conveyed her message to him as soon as he was within shouting distance.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano came, it was
sometime later. Meanwhile, there was nothing she could do to save <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
unusual for female members of our masses, particularly those least enlightened,
to express their sorrow or desperation by crying loudly and otherwise acting in
a frenzied or hysterical manner. An intense lamentation and expression of grief
for a misfortune, when unchecked soon enough, is bound to result in a condition
of numbness, under which the mind becomes some­what dull.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, it is not
difficult to picture Benita's plight on October 10, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano eventually arrived, she was in no condition to explain the occur­rence
or to do anything except lament the loss of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in a daze, and did not clearly
perceive or remember what she did, or what transpired about her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not converse with <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano when he arrived, or notice the presence of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
either when he first showed up that morning, or when she went to Clark Field
and later to Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> arrived later in the morning of October 10, 1958,
she, however, confided to him that Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> was
one of the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And still later,
when the search team headed by <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> came back
empty handed, she said: "do not let this man (referring to <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>) go free, for he was the one who kid­napped"
her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error is, therefore, untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assails the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> Gilbert upon the ground that
neither had inquired about the identity of the companion of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
or converse with him (<span class="SpellE">Mesina's</span> companion) when they (<span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and his companion) allegedly went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano in the morning of October 9, 1958, and
stayed there up to 3:00 p. m., and that the remark of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
about the short life of those who do not know how to get along with others,
does not have the import the pro­secution attaches thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The significance of said remark is, however, irrelevant to the
veracity of said witnesses for the prosecution, who corro­borated each other in
connection therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the
light of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and the unknown person,
who came with him, left the house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano, at 3:00 p. m., stating that their companions were waiting for them at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>; that, at about 6:00 p. m., that same day, <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and four (4) masked men went to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>,
snatched the carbine of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> and dragged him
away; and that, thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> was found dead,
it is clear that the remark in question, made after the refusal of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano to allow further pilferage of electric
cables within the Air Base, was meant to be a threat to those who might
obstruct said pilferage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other
hand, since the man who accompanied <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano had his face covered with
a towel, it was obvious that <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and he did not
want his identity to be known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was,
therefore, indiscreet and useless to converse with him or to otherwise ask who
he was or where he came from.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the act of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> of
dissuading the posse headed by <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> from following the set of footprints going to the
right of the sugarcane plantation near <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, and of
persuading the posse to track the footprints leading to the left of said
plantation is "too insignificant" to implicate said appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is manifestly devoid of merit,
aside from being imma­terial to the issue of credibility of <span class="SpellE">Laxamana's</span>
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed, considering that the
posse had thereby failed to locate the body of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>,
which it would have found had it (the posse) turned right, which was the
logical course to take - as <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> wanted to - for
there were small footprints in that direction and <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
is small, the aforementioned act of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> tends to
show that he knew where the body was and corroborates the tes­timony of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> to the effect that he was one of those who snatched <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> in the evening of October 9, 1958.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is next urged that <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano and
Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> had contradicted each other, in that –
according to the defense - the first said that Benita "told the search
party not to allow <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> to go free because he was
the one who kid­napped her husband," whereas <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano affirmed that Benita "told him about Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
only the day after they came from the Office of the Provost Marshal and when
they were al­ready at Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>," and Benita
declared that "it was only when they were at Clark Field when she told <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano about Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
and she did not tell the same to other members of the search party. <a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The statement of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>, testified
to by <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, was made to <u>him</u>, not to the
search party or to <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, so that no
inconsistency exists between the latter's testimony and that of <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>. Besides, Benita did <u>not</u> testify that the
partici­pation of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> in the commission of the
offense had been revealed by her to <u>no other</u> person than <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What she said is that no other person <u>heard</u> <u>her</u> or <u>was</u>
<u>present</u> when she conveyed the aforementioned information to <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano. Then, too, after the ordeal of the night
before, Benita did not feel well on October 10, 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apprehension and the tension resulting
from the failure to locate the body of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> on
that date did not cer­tainly help improve the situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when she was, thereafter, brought, first
to Clark Field and, then - after the usual period of waiting during the
preliminary inquiries therein made - referred to Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>,
she was literally and understandably groggy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we add to this the fact 'that she was kept on the witness stand for
five (5) days, and that she was so extensively cross-examined by several
lawyers for the defense that the transcript of her tes­timony covered one
hundred and five (105) pages, some of which are single space, it is not in the
least strange that this simple, illiterate member of one of our tribes of
aborigines, found herself uncertain or confused on whether her conversation
with <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano took place at Clark Field or
at Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well settled is the rule that inconsistencies and contradictions incurred
by an illiterate wit­ness in the course of a lengthy examination will not
affect the cre­dibility of her testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One fact stands in bold relief, and that is that Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span> had positively recognized one of the culprits and
that she had so stated, from the very first moment she explained the
circumstances under which her husband had been "kidnapped." This was
estab­lished, not only by her testimony and that of <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano, but, also, by the appellant himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> In the light of the foregoing, and
considering that neither <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, nor <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano, nor Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>
had any possible motive to falsely incriminate appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, We do not find suffi­cient grounds to doubt the
veracity of said witnesses for the prose­cution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Referring now to Exhibits C and E, Leonardo David testified that
he had acted under duress in subscribing to the first and swear­ing to the
truth of its contents, whereas Emilio Provo affirmed that he knew nothing about
the truth of his statements in Exhibit E, he having made the same upon
instructions of Angel <span class="SpellE">Manipon</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Panolapi</span>, who assured him that he would thereby be set
free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, appellant maintains
that, being in the nature of extra­judicial admissions or confessions, the same
are admissible in evidence against its makers only, not against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Leonardo David about his alleged maltreat­ment
by the police has all the earmarks of artificiality, for he did not reveal said
maltreatment, either to his own father, when the latter visited him at Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>, or to the Justice of the Peace of Angeles City,
before whom he subscribed and swore to the truth of the contents of Exhibit
C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, his signatures on each and
everyone of the three (3) pages thereof appear to have been written with a firm
hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More important still, apart from,
in effect, ex­culpating himself therein, Leonardo David points in Exhibit C to
his brother - Federico David, <u>alias</u> "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>"
- as the sole killer of <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The participation of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
as one of those who helped "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>" drag <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> away from his guard post, was merely an incident
in the description of the crime, as committed principally by "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise significant is the fact that the latter - Federico David, <u>alias</u>
"<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>" - had al­ready been killed, in an
encounter with peace officers, shortly after October 9, 1958.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> In
short, there was no reason why the agents of the law who investigated Leonardo
David would resort to duress in order to secure a statement substantially
favorable to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit E is the transcript of the questions propounded by Fiscal
<span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and of
the answers given by Emilio Provo at the preliminary investigation conducted by
said official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angel <span class="SpellE">Manipon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Panolapi</span> - who, according to Emilio Provo,
induced him to give said answers - did not take part in said
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not even appear
that they were present when it was held.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is, likewise, nothing in the record to indicate the interest, if
any, of <span class="SpellE">Manipon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Panolapi</span>
in the case at bar, or that Emilio Provo had reasonable grounds to believe that
they could order his release or cause it to take place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, unlike Exhibit C, which depicts Federico David - <u>alias</u>
"<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>" - as the main culprit, the testimony
of Emilio Provo in Exhibit E tends to show that his father, Pan Provo, was the
mastermind, for it was he (Pan Provo) who invited <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>
to go to <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, and it was he (Pan Provo) who called <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> and persuaded him to step out of his guard post. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Moreover, Pan Provo took part in the act of
hacking <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in Exhibit C, the reference to <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> in Exhibit E was merely in­cidental to the main role
played by Pan Provo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had it been con­cocted
by the prosecution in this case, the story given by Emilio Provo in Exhibit E
would have, in all probability, followed a pat­tern identical to that of
Exhibit C, made prior thereto, or to that resulting from the testimony of
Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>
Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although all are unanimous on the parti­cipation
of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, and Exhibits C and E are in accord that
Pan Provo and Federico David had taken part, also, in the commission of the
crime, these two (2) documents do not agree as regards the details of their
participation therein. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In short, the
explanation given by Emilio Provo, for his statements contained in Exhibit E,
is manifestly unworthy of credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the admissibility of Exhibits C and E as evi­dence
against <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>, it should be noted that, although
extraju­dicial confessions are in general admissible only against those who
made the same, this rule is subject to an exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out and applied in People v.
Condemena<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Extra-judicial confessions independently made without
collusion, which are identical with each other in their essential details and
are corroborated by other evidence on record, <u>are admissible</u> as cir­cumstantial
evidence <u>against the person implicated</u> to show the probability of the
latter's actual participation in the commission of the crime."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as early as November 5, 1915, this Court had occasion to
state<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
truth of the incriminating state­ments of <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> Valencia's widow,
in connection with each one of the said three defendants, is proved by those
made by the other witness for the prosecution, Lorenzo Reyes, and by the
confession, <u>although extra-judicial</u>, made by Faustino <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span> himself in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>
to the lieutenant of the Constabulary, <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> <span class="SpellE">Cerquella</span>, and to the municipal presi­dent and a policeman
of the said pueblo; and this confession is worthy of credence and is admissi­ble
against him, as it is likewise credible and admissible <u>against his
co-defendants</u>, <span class="SpellE">Abdon</span> de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> Perez, his accusation of their participation in
the crime, <u>inasmuch as the confession is corroborated both by the testimony
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibug</span> herself and by that of Lorenzo Reyes and confirmed by
the other evidence related thereto and found in the record</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The applicability of the foregoing exception - which has been
repeatedly acknowledged and applied by this Court<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> -
to the case at bar becomes apparent when we bear in mind that the statements
contained in Exhibits C and E were made - obviously without collusion and
independently of each other - for the pur­pose of establishing the guilt of
Federico David and Pan Provo, respectively, and that they corroborate one
another and the tes­timony of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Kudiaru</span> <span class="SpellE">Laxa­mana</span> with respect to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span>
Serrano was dragged away from his guard post in the evening of October 9, 1958,
by <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> and several other persons - apparently for
not allowing them to steal and take away electric cables from Clark Field Air
Base - and then killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, said
Exhibits C and E were properly admitted as circumstantial evidence tending to
show the probability of the participation of appellant in the commission of
said offense, as testified to by said witnesses for the prose­cution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, as one of the weakest defenses available in
criminal cases, the alibi set up by appellant herein cannot off­set the
testimony of Benita <span class="SpellE">Mayuyu</span>, who positively identified
him as one of those who seized <span class="SpellE">Matignas</span> Serrano, at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, in the evening of October 9, 1958, corroborated by
the testimony of the aforementioned witnesses for the prosecution and by the
afore­mentioned Exhibits C and E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may
not be amiss to add that <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> David, whose
testimony was introduced by <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> to corroborate his
alibi, could not explain why he allegedly re­membered distinctly the presence
of <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> at the religious service in the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>
and the barrio meeting held subsequently thereto, in the evening of October 9,
1958, but could not remember other events of similar nature, at about that
period of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> would have Us
believe that <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> arrived at said meeting in the
barrio of San Nicolas around <u>9:00</u> p.m., which does not negate <span class="SpellE">Mesina's</span> presence at <span class="SpellE">Pisok</span>, at
about <u>6:00</u> p.m., the latter being less than 1/2 kilometer from the
barrio of <span class="SpellE">Camat­sili</span>, which, in turn, is about
one-hour walk from San Nicolas.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The acts proven constitute the crime of murder, qualified by
abuse of superior strength, with the aggravating circum­stances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and evident premeditation, which would warrant
the imposition of the extreme penalty, were it not for the lack of the number
of votes necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except as to the indemnity, which should be
increased from P10,000 to P12,000,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> We find, therefore, no reason to
disturb the deci­sion appealed from, which, as thus modified as to the indem­nity,
is hereby affirmed, in all other respects, with the costs of this instance
against appellant Jose <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>.</p>
