public domain to effective use for the good of the public. In pursuance of this 
policy, laws, rules and regulations have been adopted, laying down the steps by 
which such purpose may be effectively carried out.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1939">February 28, 1939</st1:date> Juan 
Padilla filed with the Bureau of Lands Homestead Application No. V-6992 over a 
parcel of land, now Lot No. 3986 of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Cadastre, 
situated in <span class="SpellE">Mambaling</span>, City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, with an area of 53,773 square meters. Since <st1:date month="2" day="4" year="1936">February 4, 1936</st1:date>, he has occupied 2.76 
hectares of the northern part of said lot as grantee of <span class="SpellE">Nipa-Bacauan</span> Plantation Permits No. 63 issued by the Bureau 
of Forestry. The Bureau of Lands approved the application for homestead on 
<st1:date month="3" day="17" year="1949">March 17, 1949</st1:date>. Padilla made 
the required improvements on the land and presented the final proof of 
occupation and. cultivation pursuant to Sec. 14 of Commonwealth Act 141. On 
<st1:date month="12" day="16" year="1952">December 16, 1952</st1:date>, the 
Director of Lands ordered the issuance of a homestead patent in his favor.</p>
<p>South of Juan Padilla's <span class="SpellE">Nipa-Bacauan</span> Plantation, 
but within Lot No. 3986, <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Quijano</span> operated a salt-work of 2.09 hectares under <span class="SpellE">Saltwork</span> Lease Agreement No. 115 with the Bureau of 
Forestry. <span class="SpellE">Quijano's</span> lease dated to as far back as 
<st1:date month="6" day="21" year="1932">June 21, 1932</st1:date>. On <st1:date month="6" day="2" year="1941">June 2, 1941</st1:date> he assigned the lease to 
the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> which intended to erect a market 
and a slaughterhouse on the land. On <st1:date month="6" day="23" year="1941">June 23, 1941</st1:date> the Bureau of Forestry issued Gratuitous 
Permit No. 1 to the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> and the latter periodically 
renewed it, the last renewal being on <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1953">June 30, 1953</st1:date>, for the period ending <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1955">June 30, 1955</st1:date>.</p>
<p>In November 1941 the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> contracted with Engineer Luis 
<span class="SpellE">Regner</span> for the construction of a slaughterhouse at the 
site covered by Gratuitous Permit No. 1. In preparation for the construction, 
lumber and other construction materials were hauled to the site. However, World 
War II broke out before construction could commence.</p>
<p>After liberation or specifically on <st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1951">October 25, 1951</st1:date> the municipal board of 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> passed Resolution No. 681 
abandoning the slaughterhouse project on the ground that it "would be 
impractical and expensive" and "would endanger the health of the persons living 
in the community". In 1954, however, said municipal board passed Resolutions 
Nos. 806 and 1119 requesting the President of the Philippines "to proclaim Lot 
No. 3986, <span class="SpellE">Swo</span> 22654, situated in the Barrio of <span class="SpellE">Mambaling</span>, City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, 
containing an area of 53,772 square meters as a permanent reservation site of 
the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> for an abattoir, city pound, 
stockyard and veterinary center".</p>
<p>Juan Padilla died on December 10, 19-16. His heirs, Emilio and Alberto 
Padilla, inherited his homestead. They filed on <st1:date month="8" day="5" year="1954">August 5, 1954</st1:date> a petition with the Bureau of Forestry to 
cancel Gratuitous Permit No. 1 on the ground that the same covered land within 
their homestead. On <st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1955">May 12, 
1955</st1:date> the Director of Forestry denied the petition, stating that the 
aforesaid homestead fell within forest zone, and ordered the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> to vacate the premises and remove their 
improvements <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>. The <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources, but the Director of Forestry was sustained.</p>
<p>Whereupon, on <st1:date month="10" day="11" year="1955">October 11, 
1955</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> filed in the Court of 
First Instance of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> a 
petition for certiorari (Case No. R-4233) seeking review of the Director of 
Forestry's decision of <st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1955">May 12, 
1955</st1:date> and the order of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources affirming it, dated <st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1955">August 1, 
1955</st1:date>. However, this case was dismissed because on <st1:date month="10" day="21" year="1955">October 21, 1955</st1:date> the Secretary set 
aside his order dated <st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1955">August 1, 
1955</st1:date>. On <st1:date month="9" day="9" year="1957">September 9, 
1957</st1:date> the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> filed with the Secretary a 
motion for reconsideration of the latter's new order.</p>
<p>The <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> also filed a petition for mandamus 
(Civil Case No. R-4041) on May 31, 1955, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> against the Director of Lands, compelling him to issue 
the homestead patent over Lot No. 3986 in their favor as ordered on December 16, 
1952. The City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> tried, but failed, to intervene. 
The petition for mandamus was granted. The Director of Lands appealed but later 
withdrew his appeal. Nonetheless, the patent has not been issued.</p>
<p>On <st1:date month="3" day="3" year="1956">March 3, 1956</st1:date> the City 
of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> 
filed with the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources a motion for the 
reconsideration of the order of <st1:date month="12" day="16" year="1952">December 16, 1952</st1:date> directing the issuance of a homestead 
patent in favor of Juan Padilla. Furthermore, the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> filed 
a complaint in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to 
declare null and void the decision in Civil Case No. R-4011 (Mandamus) ; the 
order of the Director of Lands for the issuance of homestead patent in favor of 
Padilla; the patent itself, if issued; and the orders and decisions of the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Director of Lands in 
favor of the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span>. It also asked for possession of 
Lot No. 3986, reimbursement of expenses, damages and costs. The <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> were included as <span class="GramE">parties</span> 
defendants. Subsequently, the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> amended its complaint by further 
alleging that its motions for reconsideration had not yet been acted upon by the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of cause of 
action, stating that it was prematurely filed. The court granted the motion and 
dismissed the complaint.</p>
<p>The City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> appealed and the case was 
elevated to the Court of Appeals. On <st1:date month="9" day="18" year="1961">September 18, 1961</st1:date>, however, the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> moved 
in said court for the confirmation of an agreement it had entered into with the 
<span class="SpellE">Padiltas</span>. The terms of the agreement are embodied in 
Resolution No. 823 of the municipal board, reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"Resolved, That the Municipal Board, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, 
confirming the letter of the Chairman, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City 
Planning Board, dated April 14, 1961, addressed to Mr. Alberto Padilla, would 
interpose no objection to the granting of title to a portion or portions of that 
tract of land known, us Lot No. 3986 located at <span class="SpellE">Spolarium-Kinalumsan</span> River, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
City, provided that the other portion or areas thereof marked and set aside as 
site (1) for the proposed City Abattoir, (2) for the proposed extension of 
Salvador Street, and (3) for the proposed <span class="SpellE">channelization</span> of <span class="SpellE">Kinalumsan</span> River 
be first excluded from the said title that may be so granted, in view of the 
fact that said lot is included in the Neighborhood Development Plan, Scheme-C, 
as per Resolution No. 20, dated November 4, 1960, of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Planning Board; and provided further that a 
separate title or title should first be issued to the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> covering each of the areas desired and set aside as 
site for the proposed City Abattoir, extension of Salvador Street, and <span class="SpellE">channelization</span> of <span class="SpellE">Kinalumsan</span> River 
above mentioned;</p>
<p>"Resolved Further, That a copy of this Resolution be furnished the Director 
of Lands, Manila, with the pertinent plan duly approved by the proper 
authorities in Manila showing the site for the proposed City Abattoir, extension 
of Salvador Street, and the <span class="SpellE">channelization</span> of <span class="SpellE">Kinalumsan</span> River aforesaid; and another copy thereof be 
furnished Mr. Alberto Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Taboc</span>-canal, <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
City."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="GramE">and</span> in a public document signed by the Padilla 
brothers, quoted hereunder;</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p>"KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:</p>
<p>"We, Emilio Padilla and Alberto Padilla, both Filipinos, of age, married and 
residents of <span class="SpellE">Mambaling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
City, do hereby known to the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
City that we agree and consent to the proposals and terms embodied in Resolution 
No. 823 of the Municipal Board and request that this manifestation of our 
approval in conformity to the said terms and conditions of the proposal in 
Resolution No. 823 be noted, subject to the rules, laws, regulations and just 
determinations by the Director of Lands in cases of this nature, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, July 26, 1961"</p></blockquote>
<p>On this motion for confirmation of agreement, the Solicitor General, acting 
in behalf of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources, manifested that he would interpose no objection to the agreement 
provided that the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> be issued no title to 
the excluded sites, on the ground that they are public land and the City of 
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> had not filed an application to acquire title 
thereto.</p>
<p><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> thereupon stated that should the 
objection of the Solicitor General be considered as tenable, it could have no 
alternative but to insist that the case be decided on the merits. The <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span>, on the other hand, prayed for judgment in 
accordance with the motion for confirmation leaving out the portion objected to 
by the Solicitor General. The Court of Appeals desisted from acting on the 
aforesaid motion; instead, it forwarded the case to this Court as involving a 
question of law.</p>
<p>The City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> interposes no objection to the 
granting of patent over Lot No. 3986, provided the three sites already mentioned 
be excluded from the patent and a separate title thereto be first issued in its 
favor. Such proposal was accepted by the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> 
"subject to the rules, laws, regulations and just determinations of the Director 
of Lands". Subsequently, both parties asked for judgment based on their 
agreement.</p>
<p>Under pertinent laws, rules and regulations, the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> 
cannot be given a title over the three sites aforementioned as it has not 
previously taken proper steps to acquire title thereto.</p>
<p>Obviously, the agreement of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> and the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> should be construed in the light of existing laws, 
rules and regulations. We specifically refer to Section 83 of the Public Land 
Law which the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> can avail of by resolution of 
its municipal board requesting the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources to recommend a proclamation by the President of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
withdrawing from sale or settlement and reserving for its use, the three sites 
aforementioned. Such prerequisites under the law should be followed before the 
City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> may be granted exclusive use of the sites 
in question; that is precisely what the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span>, in 
conforming to the terms of the agreement, must have had in mind when they 
specifically stated, "subject to the rules, laws, regulations and just 
determinations by the Director of Lands in cases of this nature."</p>
<p>We observe that in 1954, the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>, per Resolutions Nos. 806 and 
1119 of the municipal board, requested the President of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> to 
reserve the lot in question for its exclusive use. The records do not show, 
however, any action taken thereon by the President. It is not hard to see why 
Lot No. 3986 was not reserved for the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> as requested by said 
resolutions: <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3986 was being claimed by the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span>. The confirmation of the agreement between the City 
of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> 
and the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span> will pave the way for the reservation 
by the Chief Executive of the three sites within <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3986 
to be segregated from the <span class="SpellE">Padillas</span>' homestead.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of dismissal is set aside and the "Motion for 
C onfirmation of Agreement" is hereby granted. Judgment is rendered approving the 
agreement of the parties, in consonance with which the Director of Lands and the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources are ordered to exclude the sites 
for the proposed city abattoir, extension of Salvador Street and <span class="SpellE">channelization</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Kinalumsan</span> 
River from the homestead patent that may be issued to Emilio and Alberto Padilla 
for Lot No. 3986. The acquisition and/or exclusive use by the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> of 
the portions so excluded <span class="GramE">is</span> subject to the compliance 
of the provisions of law. No costs. </p>
