rebuttal police chief Narciso Laureta, Judge Francisco T. Valera, Roque
Alcantara and Jael Pisco.</p>

<p class="BODY">No eyewitness to the commission of the double murder was
presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on the basis of
appellant's extrajudicial confession and the testimonies of witnesses who
conducted the investigation of the offenses, the following facts were
established.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the night of 31 July 1968, at about 10:00, Chief of Police
Narciso Laureta received a report from one of his policemen that two persons
were found dead in the middle of the road leading to Barrio Anggad, Bangued,
Abra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Laureta, together with
Municipal Judge Francisco T. Valera, and some policemen and a civilian, followed
later by Dr. Luis Bringas and Patrolman Eduardo Bringas, went to the
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found the dead bodies of an
old man and an old woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lying at a
distance of 25 to 30 meters apart, the victims were identified as Constantino
Bose and Consolacion Bandayrel-Bose, husband and wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was apparent that they came from the
fields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Constantino Bose was found,
the yoke of the plow was still on his shoulder and his hand was holding a rope
tied to a cow which was nonchalantly grazing at the side of the road.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pictures were taken of the victims by Mr. Vic Abaya and a sketch
of the scene of the crime was drawn by Cpl. Faustino Castillo Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the bodies of victims were
brought home.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a routine procedure, Chief of Police Laureta began his
investigation and inquiry to identify the perpetrator(s) of the crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that one policeman, Pat. Eduardo
Bringas who was on duty informed him that a few hours earlier in the same
evening at about 8:00 p.m., while he was on his way to the Municipal Hall,
coming from his house where he took his supper, he passed by Luis Beralde and
Jaime Bringas, standing at the junction (lipit) leading to Barrio Anggad, some
30 to 40 meters away from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Pat. Bringas, the two men
stopped him to ask for cigarettes and he obligingly gave them one stick of
cigarette each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lingered for a while,
talked with them, and asked why they were there, and Beralde told him that he
was waiting for his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (Pat.
Bringas) then proceeded on his way to the Municipal building.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning, on August 1, 1968, Chief of Police
Laureta, acting upon the information of Pat. Bringas, ordered his policemen to
bring Luis Beralde and Jaime Bringas to the Municipal Hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They fetched, first, Jaime Bringas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the beginning of the investigation,
Bringas hesitated to give his story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, however, he relented and told Chief Laureta that while he and
Luis Beralde were waiting at the opening of the alley, Luis intimated to him
his plan to kill the couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because he
did not like the idea, he persuaded him to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luis Beralde, however, refused and so he
(Bringas) went home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That later,
Beralde arrived home and informed him that "they were already
dead".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jaime Bringas' statements
were taken down by Sgt. Martin Arce in the presence of Chief Laureta who
occasionally asked questions.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later on, at about 10:00 a.m. of the same day, Pat. Eduardo
Bringas arrived with Luis Beralde.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief
Laureta interrogated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first,
Beralde was also evasive; but after several searching questions, he broke down
and cried and admitted that he was the one who killed Constantino Bose and
Consolacion Bose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told Chief Laureta
that he killed them because the woman was a witch and she had
"tapped" his wife's head, which caused her illness; that he felt that
there was no use to go on living if his wife would die because of her
condition; that he first boloed the woman on the head and when Constantino Bose
turned around and found what happened, he delivered a thrust on the breast of
Constantino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked what weapon he
used in killing the victims, he revealed that it was a pointed bolo and that
the same was buried in the middle of the corn field, east of their house in
Barrio Anggad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Chief Laureta,
together with some policemen accompanied Beralde to the said place, and there,
at the spot Beralde pointed to, they unearthed a bolo which had stains on the
blade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not be ascertained,
however, if the stains were human blood.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Brought back to the municipal building, Beralde reiterated to
Bangued Mayor, Simplicio Bringas, the circumstances surrounding the killing of
the old man and the old woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, in
the presence of Chief Laureta -- who also propounded questions, particularly
the motive for the killing -- and Cpl. Faustino Castillo, the statement of the
accused was reduced to writing by Sgt. Martin Arce.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

in his confession that he also killed the old man Constantino Bose when said
Constantino Bose went to help his wife, but the court can­not believe this
because according to the testimony of Dr. Luis Bringas and Chief Laureta who
went to see the body of the victims on the night of the incident, they saw the
bolo of Constantino Bose still underneath the body of the deceased unsheathed
from its scabbard, so that the court is of the opinion that the accused also
killed the deceased Constantino Bose treacherously and with evident
premeditation, hence, he has also committed the crime of Murder for killing the
deceased Constantino Bose."</blockquote>

any preadventure of doubt of the crime of Double Murder for killing
treacherously and with evident premeditation Consolacion Bandayrel-Bose and her
husband, Constantino Bose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the

<p class="BODY">Now to consider and resolve the merits of the foregoing.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.a. <u>That Beralde's extrajudicial confession, Exhibit
"H", is involuntary</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
disowning his extra­judicial confession, accused-appellant claims that at the
time he was being subjected to interrogation he was forced, through violence
and intimidation, to admit the killing of the victims; that it was 3:00 in the
afternoon when the investigation was finished; that he was threatened by the
policemen that if he would not swear to it before the judge, he would suffer
further maltreatment; that at the house of the judge he was weak and dizzy as
he had not taken his lunch and he could not pay attention anymore to what was
read to him by Judge Valera; that he signed the confession because of fear that
he would be returned to the <u>presidencia</u> to undergo more maltreatment.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the trial Court found and We perceive no
reason to disturb its findings which derive ample support in the records --
that appellant's bare self-serving assertions are not worthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it noted "...the accused insisted
that Sgt. Arce maltreated him (but) he knows pretty well that Sgt. Arce, a
former member of the Bangued Police Force is no longer in the service and his
whereabouts is (sic) unknown and cannot be presented at all by the prosecution
because he cannot be located.”<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a> Moreover, accused Beralde cannot
name the other two policemen whom he alleged to have maltreated him, though he
is a co-employee in the municipal government of Bangued” and he admitted that
he had been going with them, he being a water bill collector.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a>
And lastly, the Court concluded that since "the accused is a co-employee
of the police authorities, the first natural impulse of a co-employee is to
save a co-employee under ordinary circumstances".<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We made a painstaking study of the transcript of stenographic
notes and We find that the claims of accused-appellant do not deserve serious
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot overcome the
testimonies of Chief of Police Narciso Laureta and Municipal Judge Francisco T.
Valera that the confession of the accused-appellant was freely and voluntarily
given by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These public officials who
testified for the state were not shown to have ulterior motives for testifying
falsely against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there is in their favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of
their official duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chief of Police Laureta testified that he was the one who
investigated the accused when he admitted the killing of the victims and that
he was present when Sgt. Arce reduced accused-appellant's statement into
writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That appellant was allowed to
take his lunch and that there was no force or intimidation employed upon him,
especially as he was their co-employee in the municipal government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That accused easily broke down, cried and
confessed upon learning that Jaime Bringas had supplied the police with vital
information.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Valera in turn, a disinterested witness, testified that
before appellant swore to his written confession, he informed him of his
constitutional rights, specifically his right not to testify against himself;
that he read the contents of the confession to the accused and he asked him if
he desires to sign his statement, to which he answered "yes".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He like­wise stated that when appellant
appeared before him, he was calm and there was no sign of duress.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, a perusal of the confession shows that it is rich in
details which only he could have revealed to the investigators -- the motives
behind the assault on Consolacion and Constantino; the place where the killing
took place and the time; that he met police Eduardo and even asked a cigarette
from him; and, finally, the place where he hid the fatal weapon, which was
verified by the police authorities to be correct and where in fact the bolo
(Exh. "B") was recovered.</p>

<p class="NUM">b. <u>That Exhibit "H" has badges of fraud and falsity</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that there are discrepancies
between the testimonies given in court and the statements appearing in Exhibit
"H".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellant,
his correct age then was 22 and not 24 as stated in the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, Exhibit "H" mentions
10:00 p.m. as the proximate time he killed the victims, while Dr. Bringas
definitely testified that the death of the victims occurred between 7:00 to
7:30 in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also
capitalizes on the statement of Dr. Bringas that the bolo Exhibit "B"
could not be the weapon that was used in stabbing Constantino Bose because the
wound is triangular in shape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
finally, that the motive behind the killing of the victims as stated in Exhibit
"H" is a mere fabrication, alleging that there is no corroboration
that Juliet Beralde had been sick or bewitched by Consolacion Bose and that
there is no evidence that the latter was a witch.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing alleged inconsistencies, discrepancies and
falsities in the statement (Exh. "H") upon which, coupled with proof
of <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>, the accused has been found guilty, are either
minor and inconsequential and/or sufficiently explained in the context of the
evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not merit
serious consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the
People's Brief<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a>
well taken and successfully establishes the integrity of the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus –</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant speaks of alleged badges of fraud and falsity of
Exh. "H" (p. 20, Appellant's Brief).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For instance, he contends that in Exhibit "H", his age was 24
years instead of 22 which was his correct age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, he points to the fact that Exhibit "H" also
mentions 10:00 o'clock p.m. as the approximate time when he killed the
victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discre­pancy in age
appearing in Exhibit "H" could have been deliberately intended by the
appellant to mislead the court into concluding that the confession was not
voluntarily given because of certain inaccuracies therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the same token, the information given by
the appellant in Exhibit "H" that he killed the couple at 10:00
o'clock in the night of Oct. 31, 1968 could have been also intended to mislead
the court in its appreciation of the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why would the police investigators give the
wrong information as to the approximate time of the death of the couple when at
the time the con­fession was executed, they already knew that the approximate
time of the killing was 8:00 p.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
confession was a coerced one, what the investigators would have done was to
make the recital of facts in the confession conform as much as possible with
the actual state of facts, because to do otherwise would render the confession
suspect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again, appellant describes the bolo, Exhibit 'B' used in the
killing of the couple, as fake (pp. 21 - 25, Appellant's Brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain this view, appellant poses the
question as to why the bolo was not photographed by the police, nor the
recovery of the bolo included in the narration of facts in the confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer to this question is self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the reasons why police investigators
usu­ally photograph objects used in the crime is that such objects would be
difficult to be brought to court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
is not the case as regards to the bolo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The omission of any reference regarding the bolo in the confession is
explained by the fact that the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the
bolo were within the knowledge of the police investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, any reference on the matter in the
confession would serve no purpose at all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, appellant alleges that the bolo, Exhibit 'B' could
not have been the fatal weapon because the wound inflicted on Constantino Bose
was triangular in shape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conten­tion,
however, has no basis because as Dr. Luis Bringas had later on tes­tified, the
triangular shape of the wound could have been caused by the twisting of the
bolo inside the wound, thereby giving a triangular appearance of the
wound."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">33</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to motive, it is settled that motive is not a requisite
element of any offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate the
alleged motive was supplied by accused-appellant himself and he cannot now be
heard to dispute it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides Jael Pisco,
a niece of Consolacion Bose, was presented to testify that there was a rumor
that her aunt was a witch; it is a fact, in her own words "that she gives
medicine like what the quack doctor does which we call '<u>mangod</u>-<u>odong</u>'
-- calling for the return of the spirit that was left behind somewhere".<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">34</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">c. <u>That Jaime Bringas and Sgt. Martin Arce were not presented
as witnesses for the prosecution</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant contends that since Jaime Bringas and Sgt. Arce were the
persons who could corroborate the execution of Exh. "H", the wilfull
suppression of these witnesses by the prosecution creates the presumption that
presentation would have been adverse to the prosecution and favorable to the
defense, citing Rule 131, Rules of Court, Section 5(e).<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of the Solicitor General by way of traverse is
well-taken.</p>

<blockquote>"x x x There can be no possible adverse effect insofar as the
case of the prosecution is concerned in the non-presentation of these two
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, their testimonies
were not indispensable to sustain the court's finding of guilt of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least their testimonies,
had it been given to court would have been merely corroborative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is necessarily so because, on the part
of Jaime Bringas, he only provided the clue which was availed of by the police
authorities in tracing the authorship of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be recalled that Jaime Bringas was
never an eyewitness to the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
regards Sgt. Martin Arce, while he was the one who investigated the appel­lant,
which investigation led to the execution of the extra-judicial con­fession,
Exhibit "H", his testimony in court was not deemed necessary because
the prosecution had sufficiently established the voluntariness of said
confession from the testimony of the Chief of Police as well as of the Mu­nicipal
Judge of Bangued, Abra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the
Chief of Police was present during the entire length of the interrogation of
the appellant by Sgt. Arce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of
the matter, however, is that the prosecution tried to present these two
witnesses, but notwithstanding its efforts in this direction, these two persons
were nowhere to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the defense
is of the theory that these two witnesses were available during the hearing of
the case at bar, why did it not present them, albeit, as hostile witnesses to
illicit any information that might have led the lower court to conclude that
the confes­sion of the accused was a coerced one."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">35</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">d. <u>That Beralde was denied the right to be assisted by a
counsel</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly without
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been a settled rule in our
jurisdiction since March 3, 1975, first enunciated in <u>Magtoto v. Manguerra</u>,
G.R. No. L-37201-02 and reiterated in subsequent decisions, the most recent of
which is <u>People v. Molleda</u>, G.R. No. L-34248, prom., December 12, 1978,
that the right to be represented by counsel at custo­dial investigation became
effective and enforceable only after the enactment of the Constitution on
January 17, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
investigation of accused Beralde took place in 1968 and before the enactment of
the new Constitution, the right to counsel was not applicable in this case.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. That the lower court should have accorded credence to the alibi
of appellant and acquit him on the ground of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense is alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to accused-appellant, he was at home with his family in the
Poblacion, Bangued, Abra when the victims were killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He presented his immediate relatives to corroborate
his alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's defense of alibi must necessarily fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proximity of his place of residence to
the scene of the crime does not preclude the possibility that he was at the
place of the crime at the time it was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the defense of alibi to prosper, it is
not enough that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed,
but he must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to
have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the distance between his
house and the scene of the crime could easily be negotiated in half an hour,
especially so if he used the tricycle of his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he admitted -- which admission was
corroborated by Sgt. Eduardo Bringas -- that he was present at the scene of the
crime at or about 8:00 in the same evening it was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, after a very careful consideration of the evidence of both
sides -- the extrajudicial confession freely and voluntarily given with the
proof of <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u> — and the finding that the alibi is not worthy
of credence, We conclude that the guilt of the appellant has been established
beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, as to the nature of the offense/offenses committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, under the facts proven on
record, killed Consolacion Bandayrel Bose -- whom he suspected of being a witch
and of having inflicted spells on his wife which caused her to suffer -- by
hacking her from behind with a bolo and hitting her on the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to her, therefore, the accused
committed the offense of murder qualified by treachery, i.e., the sudden attack
from the rear which prevented Consolacion from offering any defense against his
sudden homicidal assault.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Constantino Bose, the accused himself testified
that when Constantino saw him hack Consolacion from behind, Constantino, on
sudden impulse and in order to protect her, made an attempt to come to her
rescue by hitting him with his bolo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whereupon, the accused lunged at him, also inflicting fatal wounds on Constantino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, found that the
accused committed murder as against Constantino, thus –</p>

<blockquote>"x x x As to her husband, the accused stated in his confession
that he also killed the old man Constantino Bose when said Constantino Bose
went to help his wife, but the Court can­not believe this because, accord­ing
to the testimony of Dr. Luis Bringas and Chief Laureta who went to see the body
of the vic­tims on the night of the incident, they saw the bolo of Constantino
Bose still underneath the body of the deceased unsheathed from its scabbard, so
that the Court is of the opinion that the accused also killed the deceased
Constantino Bose treacherously and with evident premeditation, hence, he also
com­mitted the crime of Murder for killing the deceased Constantino Bose."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">36</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record supports the foregoing conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The oral testimony of Dr. Luis F. Bringas who saw the bodies of
the victims in the evening of July 31, 1968, clearly shows that the victim
Constantino Bose whose body was already lifeless <u>was still holding the rope
of his cow</u> which was still grazing on the side of the road, while the <u>yoke
of his plow was still on his left shoulder</u>, indicating that he came from
the fields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of Dr.
Bringas' testimony is quoted hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.

<blockquote>"Q.
- The bodies were already life­less?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Yes, sir, they were lying in the middle of
the street at a distance of around 20 meters from each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The old man was ahead, while the old woman
was at the back or behind with the particular thing that the old man had, even
dead, was holding the rope of his cow grazing at the side of the road, with his
plow on his shoulder or rather the yoke of his plow at his left shoulder,
indicating that he came from the fields.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Yes, there was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Maybe that is the handle of the bolo of the
man.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the photographer is

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Yes, sir, that is right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.
- It is partly hidden?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Yes, the bolo is partly hidden by the
victim as could be seen here."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Chief of Police Narciso Laureta, who also saw the bodies of the
victims, testified that <u>the rope of the cow was still "tied" to
the hands of Constantino Bose</u><a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a> and that the body of Constantino
was <u>resting on a bolo which was inserted in its scabbard</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, these witnesses saw that the bodies of the victims
were lying at a distance of at least 20 meters apart.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If it were true, as claimed by appellant, that Constantino Bose
"came to bolo" him while he (appellant) was attacking Consolacion,
the body of Constantino would not have been found so far away from
Consolacion's body, and he (Constantino) would have been found holding a bolo
in his hand or, at least removed the same from its scabbard, but not, as the
evidence showed, holding the rope of his cow, with the yoke of his plow still
on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The logical conclusion, therefore, is that accused-appellant
attacked Constantino so suddenly without giving him a chance to prepare for the
attack, or an opportunity to defend himself, and for such a treacherous act,
appellant should be held liable for murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, finally, as to the proper penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Information charged the accused with double murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may therefore - on the basis of the
foregoing established facts - be found guilty of the lesser-included offenses
of separate murders, of Consolacion and Constantino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the charge for double murder is not
well-taken, it appearing that the offenses committed, as the facts show, were
that of murders committed one after the other and inspired by distinct
homicidal urges, as distinguished from the complex offense of double murder,
resulting from a single act on the part of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime of murder of Consolacion was committed with the
attending, aggravating circumstance of nighttime, which accused purposely
sought to facilitate the commission of said offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, is absorbed by the qualifying
circumstance of treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">41</span></span></a> With respect to Constantino,
nocturnity is not aggravating since it was not especially sought by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intent to kill Constantino
was conceived only shortly before its commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information alleged evident premedita­tion as an aggravating
circumstance and the lower court, although it imposed the penalties of two <u>reclution
perpetuas</u> only, noted that evident premeditation, aside from treachery,
attended the killing of the deceased spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation is not present in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no direct proof offered by the
prosecution to show when Beralde meditated and reflected upon his decision to
kill the spouses and the time that had elapsed before his plan was carried out.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">42</span></span></a>
His admission that he was at Barrio Anggad at 6:00 p.m. is not a sufficient
indication of the time when he made plans or sought the deceased spouses to
accomplish his evil scheme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
the mere fact that the accused waited for his victims just before the attack is
not sufficient to sustain a finding of evident premeditation, in the absence of
proof that he had been lying in wait for a <u>substantial period</u> of time.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">43</span></span></a>
Besides, Pat. Bringas testified that when he met Beralde he found no weapon on
his person.</p>

<p class="BODY">To appreciate the circumstance of evident premeditation, it is
necessary to establish the following:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1)the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) act
manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination; and (3)
a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution to allow him
to reflect upon the consequences of his act and to allow his conscience to
overcome the resolu­tion of his will had he desired to hearken to its warning.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">44</span></span></a>
None the foregoing requisites had been proved by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the trial court's judgment
is affirmed with the sole modification that accused is guilty of two separate
