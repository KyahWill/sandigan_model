				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Sole question raised on appeal <span style="">is </span>this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is a court order confirming a sheriff's sale
upon a judgment in a real estate foreclosure case a bar to a subsequent action
by the judgment debtor to annul the sale upon grounds which were raised in said
foreclosure proceedings?</p>

<p class="BODY">First, to the background facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A contested case to foreclose a real estate and chattel mortgage [Civil
Case 45778, Court of First Instance of Manila, "Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>, plaintiff, vs. Isabel O. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Chi <span class="SpellE">Chioco</span>, et al., defendants"], resulted in
judgment ordering appellant Isabel O. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Chi <span class="SpellE">Chioco</span> (now known <span style="">as </span>Isabel <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>)
to pay <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>
P2,000.00, with 1% interest per month from December 5, 1958 until full payment,
and P500.00 as attorney’s fees, and directing that after failure to pay the
above amounts in ninety days, the properties mortgaged be sold at public
auction, subject to a first mortgage in favor of the Philippine National Bank
in reference to appellant's land (located in <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>) mortgaged.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment debt remained unpaid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court, on <span class="SpellE">Domalanta's</span>
motion, issued a writ <span style="">of </span>execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
thereto, on May 8, 1962, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> sheriff sold at
public auction the mortgaged land of 32,558 square meters to the highest
bidder, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>,
for P3,537.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>
moved to confirm the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
appellant's objection, the court, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1962</st1:date>, confirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the June 2, 1962 order had become final, appellant started
the present suit (Civil Case N-496 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, entitled "Isabel <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
plaintiff, vs. Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> Martinez, in his capacity as Provincial <span style="">Sheriff </span>of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, defendants") to annul the sheriff's sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant mortgagor was not properly notified of the foreclosure sale;
and the price for which the property was sold was "very much lower than
the actual market value" and shocking to the conscience, and thus
invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> moved to dismiss the complaint below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reason, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court, on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1962</st1:date>,
dismissed the case "with prejudice and with costs against the
plaintiff." A move to reconsider was thwarted below in the order of <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Adverted to earlier <span style="">is
</span>that the <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1962</st1:date>
order of con­firmation of the sheriff's sale in the first case - Case 45778 -
was issued over appellant's opposition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That objection projected before the court the very same grounds relied
upon in the complaint herein -the second case - to wit, lack of notice by the
Provincial Sheriff to appellant of the foreclosure sale, and irregularities in
the auction sale and non-conformity thereof to the rules of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the order of confirmation, the
thrust of appellant's said objection is that <span style="">she </span>"was not notified of the sheriff's sale and that the
price for which the property was sold <span style="">is
</span>unconscionable." But these factual allegations, so the same order
of June 2, 1962 stresses, “have not been established by any evidence", nor
was appellant's opposition verified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing in the record <span style="">suggests
that </span>after the order of June 2, 1962 in the first case (Civil Case
45778), attempt was ever made by appellant to cure the defects so pointedly
expressed by the court in that order.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Law and jurisprudence have formulated the rule that
confirmation of sale of real estate in judicial foreclosure proceedings cuts
off all interests of the mortgagor in the real estate sold and vests them in
the purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confirmation retroacts to
the date of the sale.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>An order of confirmation in court
foreclosure proceedings is a final order, not merely interlocutory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
has long been recognized.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, it <span style="">is
</span>the final order from which appeal may be taken in judicial fore­closure
proceedings.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
No appeal <span style="">was </span>taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that said order is final, binding.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Not that the disputed order of confirmation may be <span class="SpellE">labelled</span> null and void, <span style="">as </span>appellant would want it to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption that the notice of sale of
real estate in foreclosure proceedings has been given, holds true here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, indeed, a legal tenet of long standing
is that official duty presumptively has been regularly per­formed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant pleaded such lack of notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her duty it was to prove it in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">And if the notice that appellant here complains of <span style="">is </span><u>personal</u>
<u>notice</u> to her, she is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because, personal notice is not required by Section 16 of Rule 39 of the
1940 Rules of Court, now Section 18, Rule 39 of the new Rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This legal provision was given judicial nod
as early as 1930 in <u>La</u> <u>Urbana</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Bolando</u></span>,
54 Phil. 930, 932 -a case of foreclosure of real estate mortgage - where we
pronounced that "[t]he law does not require that such notification be
given personally to the party upon whose property execution is levied."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor was there an averment in the complaint now before us that if
a resale should take place, "the realty would bring a higher price"
thereat, a circumstance "essential to rescind a sale regularly made and
confirmed by a competent court, on the ground of inadequacy of price."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The mere averment that the price is unconscionable is nothing more than a
conclusion of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The value of such
allegation <span style="">is
</span>further downgraded by the lack of proof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is one case which epitomizes the fatal distance between allegation
and proof.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. Properly to be pointed out here is that the dismissal order of
<st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1962</st1:date> now on
appeal, states that the legality of the foreclosure sale questioned in this
action "was an issue that could have been, and was in fact, raised and
litigated in the anterior suit" (Civil Case 45778).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the Provincial Sheriff who <span style="">is </span>a nominal defendant here, the
parties in the two suits below are the same:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Isabel <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subject matter is the same land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment and order of confirmation of
that sheriff's sale in the first suit have both become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first suit is a judicial foreclosure of mortgage; the second,
annulment of the foreclosure sale conducted in the first suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A proceeding for judicial foreclosure of
mortgage is an action <u>quasi</u> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is based on a personal claim sought to be
enforced against a specific property of a person named party defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, its purpose is to have the property
seized and sold by court order to the end that the proceeds thereof be applied
to the payment of plaintiff's claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To be read as controlling here are Sections 44 and 45, Rule 39 of
the old Rules of Court - which is now substantially embodied in Section 49,
Rule 39 of the new Rules of Court, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 49. <u>Effect</u> <u>of</u> <u>judgments</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The effect of a judgment or final order
rendered by a court or judge of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or order, may be as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) In case of a judgment or order against a specific thing, or in
respect to the probate of a will, or the ad­ministration of the estate of a
deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition
or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment
or order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration,
or the condition, status or relationship of the person; however, the probate of
a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) In other cases the judgment or order is, with respect to the
matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised
in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in
interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special
proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the
same capacity;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their
successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former
judgment which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was
actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph (a) of the foregoing rule is commonly known to speak of
judgments <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>; paragraph (b) is said
to refer to judgments <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>; and
paragraph (c) is the concept understood in law as "conclusiveness of
judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Here, the first suit was
an action <u>quasi</u> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment therein "is conclusive only
between the parties."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Directly applica­ble is paragraph (b)
above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By that provision, the
confirmation order in the foreclosure case is, "with respect to the matter
directly adjudged or </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to any other matter
that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties"
and their privies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As we view this case from
another standpoint, we reach the same result.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that the cause of action in the first suit </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not exactly identical to the cause of action
in the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, the latter merely
challenges the legality of the sheriff's sale in the first proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do </span><span style="">say, </span><span style="">however, that such legality of sale is an issue which could have been,
and was in fact </span><span style="">raised and </span><span style="">rejected in the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, coming into play also is paragraph (c)
above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the question
raised by appellant in the present suit should be "deemed to have been
adjudged in a former </span><span style="">judgment </span><span style="">which appears upon its face to have been so
adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily in­cluded therein or necessary
thereto."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is thus beyond doubt
that the present action is barred by the conclusiveness of judgment in the
anterior suit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This case must be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
