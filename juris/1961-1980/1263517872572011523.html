				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition filed directly
with this Court to question the validity of the order of the Public Service
Commission in its Case No. 59407, dated <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">6
 December 1967</st1:date>, allegedly issued without notice to petitioner Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Transit, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Transportation Co., Inc., was the grantee of a certificate of public
convenience to operate transportation service on lines OBANDO (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>) - PORT AREA (Manila); TAÑGOS (<span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) - PORT AREA (Manila); and DAMPALIT (<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) - PORT AREA
(Manila) via <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> and vice-versa (Case No.
59407).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grantee was also authorized
to terminal the said lines from <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> Market to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Aduana</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> in the Port
Area, passing through <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>,
E. de Santos, <span class="SpellE">Elcano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Urbiztondo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span>, Rosario, Plaza Lawton, <span class="SpellE">Arroceros</span>, P. Burgos, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>,
25th Street and <span class="SpellE">Aduana</span>, only from 5:00 a. m. to 8:00
a. m. and from 4:00 p. m. to 6:00 p. m. everyday, and also from 12:00 noon to
2:00 p. m. on Saturdays and other half-day workdays.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 8 November 1952, De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Transportation petitioned the Public Service Commission for amendment of its
certificate to allow the re-routing of its lines from <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span>
Market, passing through <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Bridge,
Plaza Lawton, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Drive up to <span class="SpellE">Aduana</span>, or by passing through <span class="SpellE">Azcarraga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, Plaza <span class="SpellE">Goiti</span>, <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Bridge, Plaza Lawton, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Drive up to <span class="SpellE">Aduana</span> Street, said grantee proposing to
maintain hourly trips on these lines from 5:00 a. m. to 10:00 p. m., which
interval of trips may be reduced to 5 minutes and its service extended up to
12:00 midnight on Saturdays, Sundays, eves of holidays and holidays. It was
alleged that the proposed change of routes was demanded by public necessity.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that although the petition was tried, with the <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit appearing as lone <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>,
it remained unresolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="8">15 August 1967</st1:date>, De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Transportation filed a motion requesting the
Commission to act on the petition on the ground that the present conditions of
vehicular traffic, traffic regulations, business necessities and volume of
passenger traffic demand the immediate resolu­tion thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="9">27
 September 1967</st1:date>, the motion was heard, during which hearing nobody
appeared to oppose the same, notwithstanding publication of the notice of
hearing and service thereof to the regis­tered <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> Transit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">6 December 1967</st1:date>,
the Public Service Commission granted the petition to re-route the lines, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing from the evidence and the records of this
Commission that there is no other operator operating on the lines and routes
proposed by petitioner, it being the sole operator therein, except on short
portions thereof; that the operation of the authorized lines under the original
routes, time schedules, restrictions and conditions are no longer suited to
present business conditions, movement of passenger traffic and traffic
regulations, the Commission believes, and so holds, that public interest and
convenience would best be promoted in a proper, <span class="SpellE">adequate</span>
and suitable manner if petitioner were allowed to operate the same number of
units on the same lines, eliminating existing restrictions and operating on the
proposed routes, timetables and conditions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The certificate of public convenience was
thus accordingly amended to contain the re-routed lines proposed by the
grantee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="12">6 December 1967</st1:date>, De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Transportation Co. commenced its operation on the newly-approved routes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 September 1968, Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
Transit, Inc., a franchise holder and operator of public utility buses plying
from <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to
the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Monument (Caloocan), filed with this
Court the present petition, charging the Public Service Commission of having
acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion on granting the
petition of De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Transportation Co. presented 15
years earlier, and without notice to said petitioner, and praying that
respondents be enjoined from operating in the approved re-routed lines.</p>

<p class="BODY">With leave of this Court, the petition was amended to include
Manila De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Transportation Co. as party
respondent, it appearing that the lines covered by Case No. 59407 have been
sold and transferred to the latter by the De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Transportation Co., which transfer was duly approved by the Public Service
Commission on 31 July 1968 in Case C. N. 68-3078 (Annex 3, pages 48-55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the petition, herein respondents De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Transportation Co. and Manila De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Transportation
Co., Inc., contend that petitioner has no right to institute the present
proceeding, the latter's line of operation being different from those of the
respondents; that having allowed respondents to operate on the re-routed lines
since 7 December 1967, or for a period of more than 9 months, without lodging
any complaint against it with the Public Service Commission, petitioner is
guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; and that the instant action for <i>certiorari</i>
is not the proper remedy available to petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records bear out the fact that on <st1:date year="1968" day="31" month="7">31 July 1968</st1:date> the Public Service Commission
authorized the Manila De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Transportation. <st1:place>Co.</st1:place>,
as vendee of the lines previously granted to the De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
Transportation Co. in Case No. 59407, to operate on the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>(Lines V and VI, BALUT (<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>) - CITY
HALL (Manila) and NORTH BAY BOULEVARD - BONIFACIO DRIVE are not pertinent to
the issue in this case, and may be omitted).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the extant records of this case show that
petitioner Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Transit, Inc., is a franchise
holder and operator of public utility vehicles on the following routes:</p>

<blockquote>PARAÑAQUE (<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) - BONIFACIO MONUMENT (<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City) line, via Taft Ave. (<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City), E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos Highway (<span class="SpellE">Makati</span>) and
E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos Highway (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City), granted in Case No. 62-4559 (Annex A-Petition);</blockquote>

<blockquote>BACLARAN - BONIFACIO
MONUMENT Line, starting at the intersection of the Military road leading to
Camp Nichols passing the Manila South Road, Taft Ave., Ext., Taft Ave., Plaza
Lawton, <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Bridge, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Avenue and ends at the intersection of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Ave.,
Ext. and Samson Road (<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>), and vice-versa,
approved in Case No. 61-5645 (Annex A-3, Petition).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Although there is allegation that
petitioner also operates on certain lines granted in Cases Nos. 63-4309,
61-5644, 61-7074, 64-6724, 65-2657, and 61-5645, no proof to this effect has
here been presented. Similarly, while it is true that copies of the orders of
the Commission in Cases Nos. 62-1842 and 62-2617, provisionally approving the
therein applications for lines MALANDAY (Polo, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>)
- LIBERTAD (<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>) and BACLARAN BONIFACIO MONUMENT,
were annexed to the petition, respondents asserted in their answer that said
temporary authorizations had already expired on 16 October 1962 and 15 November
1962, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the
said orders expressly, specified, the expiration dates of the provisional
authorization of the aforementioned two (2) lines, (Annexes A-1 and A-2,
Petition), and petitioner has failed to refute, even to deny, respondents'
contention, we can only consider the above enumerated lines in the
determination of the question raised in this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from a reading of the bus-routes allowed to both
parties that there is indeed duplication in the operation of petitioner's
BACLARAN -BONIFACIO MONUMENT Line (Case No. 61-5645) and that of respondents'
Lines I, II and IV, but only starting from the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Monument, through <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, until Taft Avenue
near the City Hall (Manila), where respondents' buses will leave the main
thoroughfare, take P. Burgos street, and proceed westward to <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span> Drive and the Port Area. Petitioner's public
conveyances, on the other hand, will keep on to Taft Avenue going southward
until their terminal in <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regard respondents' Line III, NAVOTAS -
PORT AREA, the duplication of lines likewise starts from <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Monument, through <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue Extension (Grace
Park), until the intersection of <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue Extension, where respondents' Port Area bound
buses will take <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, pass through <span class="SpellE">Reina</span> <span class="SpellE">Regente</span> and Jones bridge;
whereas petitioners' buses destined for <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span> will
continue on to <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, passing the <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> bridge instead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At Plaza Lawton, however, the two lines will again Join until the
intersection of Taft Avenue and P. Burgos, where respondents' buses will veer
to the latter street on their way to Port Area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other than in these portions of Taft Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Avenue and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue Extension, no other identity
of the routes of the two companies can be cited.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such facts do not sustain petitioner's pretense of prejudice by
the approval of respondents' re-routed lines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be re­membered that the termini of petitioner's line are the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Monument and <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>,
whereas those of respondents are Port Area and the suburban towns of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>) or <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> (Tinajeros), which is some distance away from the <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Monument, or <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span> or
<span class="SpellE">Balut</span> (North Bay Boulevard sector), which are never
reached or served by petitioner's buses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Public Service Commission, in the order complained of, in fact found
that respondents' vehicles are the only public utility buses making direct
trips to those places. In short, while petitioner's buses particularly serve
that portion of the riding public that take the <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Monument route, via Manila, those of the
respondents serve especially the passengers from those suburban areas like <span class="SpellE">Obando</span> (Bulacan), <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span> bound for Manila (Port Area) and vice-versa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it may be, that on their way to or from
their starting points respondents' buses may take in or drop off passengers at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue or a part of Taft Avenue, there being no
prohibition in their franchise to this effect, but that alone would not make
herein petitioner or the operator of any line similarly using the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue and Taft Avenue route an interested party who
should be notified of the proceeding in PSC Case No. 59407.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That respon­dents' buses have to pass through
these main streets to reach their respective destination is unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To take to the smaller streets would not only
be inconvenient to the passengers but impractical as well, considering the
condition of our present traffic system. Besides, it must be realized that <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and Taft avenues are national roads taken by all
northbound vehicles coming from areas south of Manila, like <span class="SpellE">Baclaran</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> and others, and by all southbound vehicles
coining from places north of Manila, such as <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span> and others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These roads, constituting the main artery of vehicular traffic from the
north to the south of the city of Manila, are being used not only by public
conveyances operating in Manila and suburbs but even by provincial buses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold, therefore, that all such users of
these roads are interested parties that must be personally notified of the
hearing of respondents' motion for re-routing of their lines would be to
require the unreasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in one
case, where the termini of the lines applied for by a party are found to be the
intersection of N. Domingo and Boston streets and the intersection of N.
Domingo and <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span> streets (in San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) and the City Hall in Manila, whereas the termini of
the line of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> are located at the
intersection of N. Domingo and <span class="SpellE">Blumentritt</span> in San
Juan and the intersection of <span class="SpellE">Arlegui</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barbosa</span> streets in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>,
Manila, this Court held that the services respectively rendered by the parties
therein are entirely different and distinct from each other, although parts of
their routes are identical.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And where the authorized lines of the <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> are
different from those applied for by the applicant, the former cannot be
considered to have substantial interest in the applica­tion so as to require
his personal notification of the hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, there is evidence on record that the motion to
re-route their lines was demanded by public interest and convenience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the Commission granting said
motion stated:</p>

<blockquote>"In support of the petition, petitioner adduced evidence to
the effect that presently, it is the only authorized transportation operator on
the lines <span class="SpellE">Obando</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>)-Port
Area, Manila; <span class="SpellE">Tañgos</span> (Navotas, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>)-Port
Area, Manila; <span class="SpellE">Dampalit</span> (Malabon, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>)-Port
Area, Manila via <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Balut</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>)-Port Area; that the certificate sought to be
amended is of pre World War II vintage issued under totally different
conditions and circumstances; that said conditions and circumstances have
materially changed in the matter of business conditions, traffic regulations
and most of all, the volume and movement of passenger traffic; that the
important business sectors of Manila had shifted from the western section of
the city towards the eastern, that is, towards <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Avenue and <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>; that while the pre-war service was
one catering mostly to businessmen and vendors going to <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span>,
now the bulk of passengers consists of commuters who attend classes in the
different universities and Schools in Manila, as well as employees reporting
for work daily in the different government and private offices in the city;
that when the certificate was issued the MERALCO was then operating its
electric car system with its trolley buses and regular buses, both of which
went out of existence with the termination of the war; that the restrictions
imposed under the certificate were so placed to protect the MERALCO and the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> Transportation Co. city transport operators who have
long ceased to operate; that the starting and stopping points fixed in the
existing certificate no longer respond adequately to the needs and convenience
of the present traveling, public that have multiplied manifold; that no other
operator serves nor operates on the lines and routes authorized to petitioner, nor
on the proposed routes except on short portions thereof; that the operation on
the original round-about line to Port Area with restricted hours of operation
has become impractical and inadequate; that through actual experience,
petitioner knows that it is no longer practical, profitable nor beneficial to
the public interest for petitioner to continue operating under the conditions
and routes authorized under the certificate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The rule observed in this jurisdiction
places a premium on public convenience and necessity; no grave abuse of
discretion, therefore, has been committed by the Public Service Commission in
authorizing the re-routing of the lines where, as here found, the interest of
the public would thereby be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem apparent, however, that in the course of the years
that elapsed, between the trial of respondent De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
1957 petition and the decision in 1967, changes in circumstances and the
interests of petitioner as operator in the area had supervened, which the
Public Service Commission had not taken into account in its decision based on
the evidence submitted by the respondent De <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances, of course, would have
justified petitioner Del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Transit in seeking a
reopening of the case so that its own interests should be taken into account.
Unfortunately, the record is bare of any evidence indicating that petitioner
ever called the attention of the Public Service Commission to the change in
conditions above adverted to, and to its consequent error in approving the motion
for re-routing without notice to affected parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And except in certain meritorious cases, the
es­tablished rule requires, before <i>certiorari</i> proceeding may be resorted
to, that the attention of the lower court or agency must first be called to the
alleged error that rectification, if proper, may there be made.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner's omission on this point is fatal to the present action.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>
