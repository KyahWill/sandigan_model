<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon their arrest, the said petitioners
posted bail bonds in the amount of P12,000.00, each, for their temporary

court presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Midpantao</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Adil</span> rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, all accused, namely, Rudy <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span> are hereby

of his old age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are imposing this
maximum penalty in view of the presence of three aggravating circumstances,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>conspiracy which we concluded as
equal or synonymous with evident premeditation and therefore, qualified the
killing as murder, and the aggravating circumstance of superior strength and
means to weaken the defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On account of the penalty imposed the Indeterminate Sentence
Law does not apply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All accused are jointly and severally condemned to indemnify
the heirs of the late Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Solinap</span>, Sr. the sum of

<p class="BODY">As ordered, the bail bonds of the accused were cancelled and the
accused were committed to the Iloilo Provincial Jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1976</st1:date>,
the accused filed their notice to appeal the decision to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> However,
on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1976</st1:date>, the
said accused filed a motion to withdraw their notice of appeal to enable their
new counsel, Atty. Ramon Gonzales, to file a motion for the reconsideration of
the decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 12, 1976, the accused filed a motion for the
reconsideration of said decision, contending that since they were charged with
homicide, they cannot be convicted of murder; that while the decision finds
that there was superior strength or means employed to weaken the defense, the
same was not alleged in the information and can only be considered, if ever, as
an aggravating circumstance in the crime of homicide, but not a circumstance
that would qualify the offense as murder; that the allegation of conspiracy is
not equivalent to an allegation that the offense was committed with evident
premeditation; and that since the information charges homicide, and conviction
cannot be more than said crime, the accused should be released on their bail
bonds, pending appeal, at the discretion of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court, however, denied the motion on <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1976</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused filed a petition on December 3, 1976 for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to annul and set aside the decision, upon the ground that conspiracy, which the
trial court found to be synonymous with evident premeÂ­ditation, could not
qualify the crime as MURDER, but may be appreciated only, if ever, as an
aggravating circumstance of HOMICIDE.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of Criminal Case No. 4079 were elevated on <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1976</st1:date> to the Court for
the automatic review of the decision and the case was docketed as <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. L-45266.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
with preliminary injunction (<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. L-45149) on <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1978</st1:date>, the issue therein
raised being involved in the automatic review of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1978</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed the instant petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>,
praying, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, that they be
released on their original bail bonds pending the review of the trial court's
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court issued on <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="7">July
 13, 1978</st1:date> the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> returnable to the
court and required the respondent to make a return of the writ not later than <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1978</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 a.m.</st1:time><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1978, the Solicitor General submitted a return to the
writ and answer to the petition, asking for the dismissal of the petition upon
the ground that the information charged the petitioners with the crime of
MURDER and that the petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> will not lie since
the petitioners are lawfully deÂ­tained by virtue of a decision rendered by a
court of competent jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>, the
petitioners pray that they be released on their original bail bonds pending the
review of the trial court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We take note of the fact that the information filed against the
accused does not allege any qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gravest offense therefore, for which they
may be found guilty is only homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, the instant petition shall be considered as a petition
for bail and an incident in case <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
L-45266.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is consistent with equity
and justice that the accused should be released on bail pending determination
of the criminal case against them on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of Criminal Case No. 4079,
however show that after the denial of the motion for reconsideration of the
decision, the accused, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span>,
who was "sentenced to life imprisonment" did not file a notice of his
intention to appeal the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the judgment of the lower court, insofar as he is concerned, has already become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the accused-petitioners Rudy <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span> are
hereby ordered released from custody upon their filing of a bond in the amount
of P20,000.00, each, unless there be any other reason for which they shall

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span class="SpellE">BARREDO</span>, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur but inasmuch as the circumstances of this case are
rather unusual, I would like to explain my vote in favor of allowing
accused-appellants Rudy <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span> in G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-45266 to be released
on bail because I deem it particularly necessary to elucidate on the propriety
of <u>habeas corpus</u> in G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-48450.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As explained in the main opinion penned by our distinguished
colleague, Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Jr., the
accused-appellants-petitioners above named were convicted of murder by the
trial court, with Rudy <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span> being sentenced to suffer the capital penalty of
death and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pardilla</span>
that of life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
peculiarity, however, of such judgment lies in that the fiscal labeled the
charge against them in the information as homicide and yet, their conviction
was for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the first issue
submitted for <span class="GramE">Our</span> resolution is the legality of such
conviction for an offense allegedly graver than that charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Midpantao</span> <span class="SpellE">Adil</span> presiding, obviously aware of the rule that an accused
cannot be convicted of an offense graver than that charged even if the evidence
proves the graver offense (Sec. 4, Rule 120; Sec. 13, Rule 110), justified its
assailed judgment by holding that the information under which appellants were
tried actually charged the crime of murder in its factual allegations and that
the denomination of the fiscal of the offense as homicide was erroneous, and
since the evidence supports such allegations in the information, the conviction
in question is in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main opinion rightly holds that such posture of the trial
judge is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that what
is decisive in construing <span class="GramE">an information</span> or criminal
complaint is not the nomenclature of the offense given by the fiscal or
complainant but the material facts alleged in its body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that score, however, I agree with the
holding in the main opinion that the facts alleged in the information here
involved do not constitute murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bare allegation in the information to the effect that the
three accused "conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping
each other, armed with a sharp-pointed knife known as <span class="SpellE">pinote</span>
and canes, with intent to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously attack" the deceased cannot be <span class="GramE">construed</span>, as the trial judge erroneously did, as alleging
either evident premeditation or abuse of superior strength, much less employing
means to weaken the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That two or
three persons have conspired and confederated together and mutually helped one
another in committing an offense does not necessarily imply evident
premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite clear in the
law that conspiracy is deemed to exist the moment "two or more persons
come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit
it." (Art. 8, Revised Penal Code.) On the other hand, "to authorize
the finding of premeditation it must appear not only that the accused had
formed a determination to commit the crime prior to the moment of its execution
but that this determinaÂ­tion was the result of meditation, calculation,
reflection or persistent attempt." (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Aquino</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> Revised Penal Code, Vol. I, pp. 326-327.) Thus, an
allegation of conspiracy, without more, cannot be equated with the qualifying
circumstance of evident premeditation, (People vs. Peralta, 25 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 759; People vs. Mendoza, 91 Phil. 58; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lesada</span>, 70 Phil. 525; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>,
30 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 694.) specially when such allegation is taken
together with the fact that the fiscal must have had in mind only homicide as
proven by the denomination he specifically attached to the offense in the
information signed by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in
case of doubt when there is seeming variance between the body of the
information and the naming of the offense by the fiscal, such doubt must be
resolved in favor of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it may be stated that while it is perhaps
best that in cases of murder, the fiscal should allege clearly the qualifying
circumstance he means to charge distinctly from the aggravating circumstances
also mentioned in the information, the present practice whereby the
denomination itself of the charge as murder is already considered as
sufficiently indicating that any qualifying circumstances therein alleged,
unless otherwise indicated, is intended to be so is permissible, as long as at
the arraignment the exact nature of the charge is clearly explained to the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a circumstance alleged in
the information, which by its nature is a qualifying one, may be deemed as such
only when the crime is denominated by the fiscal specifically as murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can the offense here in question be deemed as qualified
by the allegation that there were three persons (the accused) who attacked the
deceased, which the trial court considered as constituting sufficient
allegation of taking advantage of superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Superioridad</u></span>
is not a matter of number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the
additional allegation in the information that the accused were "armed with
a sharp-pointed knife and known as <span class="SpellE">pinote</span> and
canes" be deemed as adequately alleging "taking advantage of superior
strength", there being no other circumstances alleged leading inexorably
to such conclusion." It is to be presumed that since the fiscal
denominated the offense as homicide instead of murder, he must have done so
because the facts gathered by him during the preliminary investigation do not
warrant such a conclusion, notwithstanding the number of the accused and the
weapons they were armed with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Much less may such allegation that the accused were superior in
number and armed, without more, be enough to constitute an allegation that they
"employed means to weaken the defense", which respondent judge
considered as also a qualifying circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be unfair to the accused to do so, for the same reasons I have
discussed with reference to superior strength.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, fiscals have the primary responsibility to frame <span class="SpellE">informations</span> with due care, so as to avoid controversy as
to the definite nature of the offense charged therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should always bear in mind the
imperative need for such definiteness, considering the legal complications that
can arise otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That an accused
person can be convicted only of a lesser offense than that actually committed
by him, only because of ambiguity or error in the framing of the information is
a rank disservice to the interests of justice and public order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And trial judges ought not to construe any
information on the basis of the evidence but only in the light of its own
factual allegations, <span class="GramE">specially</span> when such construction
would prejudice the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
construction has to be indulged in because of any ambiguity in the information,
it is imperative under the unequivocal mandate of the Bill of Rights to
properly inform the accused about such need at the arraignment and not
afterwards, certainly, not in the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such is also the demand of fairness and justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused must not be made to stand trial
and be convicted for an offense of which he was not duly informed beforeÂ­hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No less than the Constitution is definite
that the exact nature of the offense must be made known and understood by the
accused at the arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
constitutional rule cannot be changed by the trial judges on the excuse that
they are acting on the basis of the facts subsequently gathered by them from
the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Judges,</span>
like referees in sports contests, may not change the rules after play has
began, much less at the end of the game.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, <span class="GramE">We</span> have already held that convicting an
accused of an offense graver than that charged is a denial of due process
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bumanlag</span>, G. R. No. L-9483, <st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="1">Jan. 30, 1960</st1:date>, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Despavellador</span>, 1 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 205) and
consequently, the court must be deemed to exceed its jurisdiction, if it does
so.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another peculiarity in the decision under Our scrutiny,
which I consider of equal, if not more significant importance, if only because
it involves a point of procedure which appears to me to be of first impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refer to the propriety of <u>habeas corpus</u>
as the remedy under the unusual situation in which petitioners-appellants have
found themselves in this case thru no fault of theirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As will be noted, <span class="GramE">We</span> are actually
resolving the case of appellants under two <span class="SpellE">expedientes</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the appeal of appellants from their
conviction (G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-45266) and (2) their petition for
habeas corpus (G. R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-48450).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This came about because at first, when the
decision in question was read to them, the accused merely filed an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after they had apparently
perfected their appeal that their new counsel withdrew the same and filed a
motion for reconsideration, calling the attention of the court to the first
peculiarity I have discussed of its having convicted them of murder under a
charge of homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When His Honor
denied said motion for reconsideration, they came to us with a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> (in G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-45149); which was,
however, denied on the ground that the issue could be resolved in the course of
the appeal itself, it being necessarily involved therein.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, instead of asking for the reconsideration of that
dismissal, appellants filed the instant petition for <u>habeas corpus</u>,
contending that they are being denied their right to liberty on bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, the procedural question that
confronts <span class="GramE">Us</span> is, is not Our denial of that petition
for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> in <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
<span class="GramE">L-45149 a bar to this petition for <u>habeas corpus</u>?</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, is <u>habeas corpus</u> the
appropriate remedy in the premises?</p>

<p class="BODY">To my mind, the first thing to consider in answering these
questions is that the error of the trial court I have explained above of
convicting the appellants of murder instead of homicide only is not just an
error of judgment but one of excess of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a trial court to convict an accused of
homicide where he is charged with murder because of erroneous appreciation of
the evidence or of a misapplication of the pertinent provisions of the Revised
Penal Code would be an error of judgment only because he would be acting within
his powers, homicide being an offense included in that which is charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case, however, where the offense charged
is homicide and nothing in the allegations in the information can be clearly
construed as a qualifying circumstance, such as to make the accused aware at
the arraignment that upon proof thereof it could be considered as such against
him, but, in the mind of the judge, the evidence shows the existence of such
qualifying circumstance, like the situation in the case at bar, there is the
explicit injunction of Section 4 of Rule 120 to the effect that in the face of
such variance between the allegation in the information and the proof, the
"defendant shall be convicted (only) of the offense charged included in
that which is proved" and never of the offense proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Guzman, 8 Phil. 21.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, Section 4 of Rule 20 delimits the authority and
power of the court in the situations therein contemplated, such that a court
would be committing an act in excess of jurisdiction rather than a mere error
of judgment the moment it convicts an accused for an offense graver than that
with which he is charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to
the view maintained by the Office of the Solicitor General thru then Acting
Solicitor General Vicente Mendoza, Assistant Solicitor General Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Racela</span> and Solicitor Norberto P. Eduardo, I hold that the
matter involved here is one of jurisdiction since, as I have already stated
earlier, it amounts to a denial of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even in such an eventuality, the error may not be corrected
by <i>certiorari</i>, if it can adequately be taken up in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Certiorari</i>, like the other special
civil actions of prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> is conditioned on the absence
of "appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law." (Sections 1, 2 and 3, Rule 65.) Thus, it is only when such
appeal or other remedy is inadequate to avoid irreparable injury or obvious
injustice that a special civil action may be resorted to even where want or excess
of jurisdiction is alleged.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, when appellants came to this Court with
their petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> in <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>.
No. L-45129, the Court acted pursuant to the foregoing rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in ruling in <span class="GramE">Our</span>
resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1979</st1:date>
that "the question raised (is) involved in the automatic review", We
simply meant that the question being raised by petitioners need not be the
subject of a separate suit or proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This did not necessarily mean that the matter may not be taken up as a
preliminary issue in the appeal proceedings, as for instance, in a motion for
bail based, precisely on the ground that since the accused should have been
convicted only of homicide, and not of murder, and could not, under the
circumstances found by the trial court, have been sentenced to suffer a penalty
of more than <u>reclusion temporal</u> under Article 249 of the Revised Penal
Code, they are entitled to bail as a matter of right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, such a motion could be filed here
even after the trial court has denied a similar one filed with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as stated in the main opinion, disregarding technicalities
of procedure, and so that herein accused appellants may enjoy immediately the
right which the trial court has erroneously denied them, <span class="GramE">We</span>
have treated the petition for <u>habeas corpus</u> in G. R. No. L-48450 as the
motion for bail I have referred to above.</p>

<p class="BODY">I must add <span class="SpellE">tho</span>' that, in my view, such
petition for <u>habeas corpus</u> was not out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a sense, after the trial court denied
appellants' petition for bail, their continued detention became illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reiterate, appellants have been denied due
process; their constitutional right to be properly informed of the charge
against them has been violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If for this alone, they are entitled to a speedy remedy by which
their right to be freed on bail, accused as they are of a <span class="SpellE">bailable</span>
offense, could be recognized and enforced.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 1 of Rule 102, "the
writ of <u>habeas corpus</u> shall extend to all cases of illegal confinement
or detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty." In <span class="SpellE">Dacuyan</span> vs. Ramos, 85 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 487,
Our distinguished present Chief Justice, the Honorable Enrique M. Fernando,
ruled that "<u>habeas corpus</u> lies in case of loss of jurisdiction by a
tribunal due to a denial of constitutional right", citing the 1924 case of
<span class="SpellE">Conde</span> vs. Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, in actual practice, erroneous denial of bail in cases involving
capital offenses has always been brought to this Court via <u>habeas corpus</u>
petitions and <span class="GramE">We</span> have always entertained them as
such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, I cannot see any reason why
under the peculiar circumstances of the case of herein appellants, <u>habeas
corpus</u> would not <span class="GramE">lie</span>, the denial of the petition
for <i>certiorari</i> in <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. L-45149
notwithstanding, <span class="GramE">specially</span> because said denial was not
based on the merits but on a procedural ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the conviction of the appellants of a crime graver than that
they were charged with is in more than a sense similar to the imposition of a
penalty that is excessive, where the remedy is <u>habeas corpus</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, the release on bail of the appellants has nothing to
do with the issue of their guilt of the crime for which they have been
tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that <span class="GramE">We</span>
are deciding here is that in any event, they cannot be convicted of murder but
only of homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling does not
even close the door to their acquittal if <span class="GramE">We</span> should
find the evidence insufficient to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
