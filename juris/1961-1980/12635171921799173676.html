				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Youth, the threshold of life, is invariably accompanied by that euphoric
sense of well-being, and with reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The future, bright with promise, looms ahead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One's powers are still to be tested, but one
feels ready for whatever challenge may come his way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is that heady atmosphere of
self-confidence, at times carried to excess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The temptation to take risks is there, ever so often, difficult, if not
impossible, to resist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could be
then a lessening of prudence and foresight, qualities usually associated with
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For death seems so remote and
contingent an event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is not always
the case though, and a slip may be attended with consequences at times
unfortunate, even fatal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some such thought apparently was in the mind of the lower court
when it dismissed the complaint for recovery of damages filed by plaintiff-appellant,
<span class="SpellE">Preciolita</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>,
whose husband, the late Ralph W. <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>, was, at the
tender age of twenty-one, the victim of a grim tragedy, when the jeep he was
driving collided with a locomotive of defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Manila Railroad Company, close to midnight on the evening of February 21, 1957,
at the railroad crossing in <span class="SpellE">Balibago</span>, Angeles, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, in front of the Clark Air Force Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the decision appealed from, the lower
court, after summarizing the evidence, concluded that the deceased "in his
eagerness to beat, so to speak, the on­coming locomotive, took the risk and
attempted to reach the other side, but unfortunately he became the victim of
his own mis­calculation."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The negligence imputed to defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
was thus ruled out by the lower court, satisfactory proof to that effect, in
its opinion, being lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this
appeal direct to us, the amount sought in the concept of damages reaching the
sum a P282,065.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of the
evidence of record fails to yield a basis for a reversal of the decision
appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the decision appealed from, there is no dispute as
to the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In December
1956, plaintiff, 19 years of age, married Ralph W. <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>,
Jr., 21 years of age, * * *; that <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>, Jr. was an
air police of the Clark Air Force Base; that at the time of the accident, he
was driving the fatal jeep; that he was then returning in said jeep, together
with a P. C. soldier, to the Base; and that <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>,
Jr. died of serious burns at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Base</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> the next day, while the
soldier sustained serious physical injuries and burns."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then came a summary of the testimony of two of the witnesses for
plaintiff-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Ronald J. Ennis, a witness of the
plaintiff, substantially declared in his deposition, * * *, that at the time of
the accident, he was awaiting transportation at the entrance of Clark Field,
which was about 40 to 50 yards away from the tracks and that while there he saw
the jeep coming towards the Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said that said jeep slowed down before reaching the crossing, that it made a
brief stop but that it did not stop –dead stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Elaborating, he declared that while it was slowing down, <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>, Jr. shifted into first gear and that was what he
meant by a brief stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified
that he could see the train coming from the direction of <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city> and that he heard a warning but that it was
not sufficient enough to avoid the accident."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Also:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
de la Paz, another witness of the plaintiff, testified that on the night of <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1957</st1:date>, he was at the <span class="SpellE">Balibago</span> checkpoint and saw the train coming from Angeles
and a jeep going towards the direction of Clark Field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that he heard the whistle of the
locomotive and saw the collision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
jeep, which caught fire, was pushed forward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He helped the P. C. soldier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
stated that he saw the jeep running fast and heard the tooting of the
horn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not stop at the railroad
crossing, according to him."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After which reference was made to the testimony of the main
witness for defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Capin</span>, "who was at the engine at the time of the
mishap," and who "testified that before the locomotive, which had
been previously inspected and found to be in good condition, approached the
crossing, that is, about 300 meters away, he blew the siren and repeated it in
compliance with the regulations until he saw the jeep suddenly spurt, and that
although the locomotive was running between 20 and 25 kilometers an hour and
although he had applied the brakes, the jeep was caught in the middle of the
tracks."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The above finding as to the non-existence of negligence
attributable to defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Manila Railroad
Company comes to us encased in the armor of what admittedly appears to be a
careful judicial appraisal and scrutiny of the evidence of record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus proof against any attack unless
sustained and overwhelming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that it
is invulnerable, but it is likely to stand firth in the face of even the most
formidable barrage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the more traditional terminology, the lower court judgment has
in its favor the presumption of correctness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is entitled to great respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all, the lower court had the opportunity of weighing carefully
what was testified to and apparently did not neglect it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no affront to justice then if its
finding be accorded acceptance, subject of course to the contingency of ulti­mate
reversal if error or errors, substantial in character, be shown in the
conclusion thus arrived at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fair
statement of the governing principle to say that the appellate function is
exhausted when there is found to be a rational basis for the result reached by
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As was held in a 1961 decision:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"We have already ruled that when the credibility of witnesses is
the one at issue, the trial court's judgment as to their degree of credence
deserves serious consideration by this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
An earlier expression of the same view is found in Jai-Alai Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"After going over the record, we find no
reason for rejecting the findings of the court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questions raised hinge on credibility,
and it is well-settled that in the absence of compelling reasons, its
determination is best left to the trial judge who had the advantage of hearing
the parties testify and of observing their demeanor on the witness stand."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a 1964 opinion, we adhered to such an approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"'Nothing in the record suggests any arbitrary or abusive conduct
on the part of the trial judge in the formulation of the ruling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conclusion on the matter is sufficiently
borne out by the evidence presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are denied, therefore, the prerogative to disturb that finding, consonant to
the time-honored tradition of this Tribunal to hold trial judges better
situated to make conclusions on questions of fact.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On this ground alone we can rest the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of
the judgment appealed from.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Nor is the result different even if no such presumption were
indulged in and the matter examined as if we were exercising original and not
appellate jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sad and
deplorable situation in which plaintiff-appellant now finds herself, to the
contrary notwithstanding, we find no reason for reversing the judgment of the
lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">This action is predicated on negligence, the Civil Code making
clear that whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being
negligence, is under obligation to pay for the damage done.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Unless it could be satisfactorily shown, therefore, that defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was guilty of negli­gence then it could riot be
held liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crucial question,
therefore, is the existence of negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above Civil Code provision, which is a reiteration of that
found in the Civil Code of Spain, formerly applicable in this jurisdiction,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
had been interpreted in earlier decisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, in Smith v. <span class="SpellE">Cadwallader</span> Gibson Lumber
Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span> was cited to the following effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"'Among the questions most frequently
raised and upon which the majority of cases have been decided with respect to
the application of this liability, are those referring to the determination of
the damage or prejudice, and to the fault or negligence of the person
responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are the two indispensable factors in the obligations under
discussion, for without damage or prejudice there can be no liability, and
although this element is present no indemnity can be awarded unless arising
from some person's fault or negligence."</p>

<p class="BODY">Negligence was defined by us in two 1912 decisions, United States
v. <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and United States v. <span class="SpellE">Barias</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Cooley's formulation was quoted with approval in both the <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Barias</span> decisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Judge Cooley, in his
work on Torts (3d ed.)', Sec. 1324, defines negligence to be:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'The failure to observe for the protection of
the interests of another person that degree of care, precaution, and vigilance
which the circum­stances justly demand, whereby such other person suffers
injury.‘” There was likewise a reliance on Ahern v. Oregon Telephone Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Negligence is want of the
care required by the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
a relative or comparative, not an absolute, term and its application depends
upon the situation of the parties and the degree of care and vigilance which
the circumstances reasonably require.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the danger is great, a high degree of care is necessary, and the
failure to observe it is a want of ordinary care under the circumstances."</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, by such a test, no negligence could be imputed to
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and the action of
plaintiff-appellant must necessary fail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts, being what they are, compel the conclusion that the liability
sought to be fastened on defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had not
arisen.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Plaintiff-appellant, in her brief, however, would seek a
reversal of the judgment appealed from on the ground that there was a failure
to appreciate the true situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
the first three assigned errors are factual in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third assigned error could be summarily
disposed of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would go against the
evidence to maintain the view that the whistle was not sounded and the brakes
not applied at a distance of 300 meters before reaching the crossing </p>

<p class="BODY">The first two assigned errors would make much of the failure of
the lower court to hold that the crossing bars not having been put down and
there being no guard at the gate­house, there still was a duty on the part of <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span> to stop his jeep to avoid a collision and that <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Capili</span>, who drove the
engine, was not qualified to do so at the time of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one cannot just single out a circumstance
and then confidently assign to it decisive weight and signifi­cance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considered separately, neither of the two
above errors assigned would call for a judgment different in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor would a combination of acts allegedly im­pressed
with negligence suffice to alter the result.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The quantum of proof required still had not been met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged errors fail of-their desired
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case for
plaintiff-appellant, such as it was, had not been improved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no justification for reversing the
judgment of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be stressed too much that the decisive consider­ations
are too variable, too dependent in the last analysis upon a common sense
estimate of the situation as it presented itself to the parties for us to be
able to say that this or that element having been isolated, negligence is
shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factors that enter the
judgment are too many and diverse for us 'to imprison them in a formula
sufficient of itself to yield the correct answer to the multi-faceted problems
the question of negligence poses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every
case must be dependent on its facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
circumstances indicative of lack of due care must be judged in the light of
what could reasonably be expected of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the objective standard of prudence be met,
then negligence is ruled out.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this particular case, it would be to show less than fidelity
to the controlling facts to impute negligence to, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first three errors assigned certainly do
not call for that conclusion.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The fourth assigned error is deserving of a more extended treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-appellant apparently had in mind
this portion of the opinion of the lower court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The weight of authorities is to the effect that a railroad track
is in itself a warning or a signal of danger to those who go upon it, and that
those who, for reasons of their own, ignore such warning, do so at their own
risk and responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>, Jr., who un­doubtedly had crossed the checkpoint
frequently, if not daily, must have known that locomotive engines and trains
usually pass at that particular crossing where the accident had taken
place."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Her assignment of error, however, would single out not the above
excerpt from the decision appealed from but what to her is the apparent
reliance of the lower court on <span class="SpellE">Mestres</span> v. Manila
Electric Railroad &amp; Light Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Pasibi</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In the <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span> case, the doctrine announced by this
Court follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A person in control
of an automobile who crosses a railroad, even at a regular road crossing, and
who does not exercise that pre­caution and that control over it as to be able
to stop the same almost immediately upon the appearance of a train, is guilty
of criminal negligence, providing a collision occurs and injury results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the purposes and the general
methods adopted for the management of railroads and railroad trains, we think
it is incumbent upon one approaching a railroad crossing to use all of his
faculties of seeing and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
should approach a railroad crossing cautiously and carefully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should look and listen and do everything
that a reasonably prudent man would do before he attempts to cross the
track." The <span class="SpellE">Mestres</span> doctrine in a suit arising
from a collision between an automobile and a street car is substantially
similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It may be said, however, that, where a
person is nearing a street crossing toward which a car is approaching, the duty
is on the party to stop and avoid a collision who can most readily adjust
himself to the exigencies of the case, and where such person can do so more
readily, the motorman has a right to presume that such duty will be
performed."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, as plaintiff-appellant would now v. Manila Railroad
Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the controlling facts of allege, that there has been a drift away from the
apparent rigid and inflexible doctrine thus set forth in the two above cases as
evidenced by <span class="SpellE">Lilius</span> which, however, are easily
distinguishable from what had been correctly ascertained in the present
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a deviation from the earlier
principle announced is not only true of this jurisdiction, but also of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is made clear by Prosser.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Speaking of a 1927 decision by Justice Holmes, he had the following to
say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Especially noteworthy in this
respect is the attempt of Mr. Justice Holmes, in Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railway
v. Goodman, to 'lay down a standard once for all, which would require an
automobile driver approach­ing a railroad crossing with an obstructed view to
stop, look and listen, and if he cannot be sure otherwise that no train is
coming, to get out of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basic
idea behind this is sound enough:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it is
by no means proper care to cross a railroad track without taking reasonable
precautions against a train, and normally such precautions will require
looking, hearing, and a stop, or at least slow speed, where the view is
obstructed."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then, barely seven years later, in 1934, came <span class="SpellE">Pokora</span>
v. Wabash Railway,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
where, according to Prosser, it being shown that "the only effective stop
must be made upon the rail­way tracks themselves, in a position of obvious
danger, the court disregarded any such uniform rule, rejecting the 'get out of
the car' requirement as 'an uncommon precaution, likely to be futile and
sometimes even dangerous, and saying that the driver need not always stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Illustrations such as these, said Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span>, 'bear witness to the need for
caution in framing standards of behavior that amount to rules of law, * * *
Extraordinary situations may not wisely or fairly be subjected to tests or regu­lations
that are fitting for the commonplace or normal."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What Justice <span class="SpellE">Cardozo</span> announced would
merely emphasize what was set forth earlier that each and every case on
questions of negligence is to be decided in accordance with the peculiar
circumstances that present themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no hard and fast rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be that observance of that degree of care, precaution, and
vigilance which the situation demands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> acted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undeniable, then that no negligence can
rightfully be imputed to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">What commends itself for acceptance is this conclusion arrived at
by the lower court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Predicated on
the testimonies of the plaintiff's witnesses, on the knowledge of the deceased
and his familiarity with the setup of the checkpoint, the existence of the tracks;
and on the further fact that the locomotive had blown its siren or whistle,
which was heard by said witnesses, it is clear that <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>,
Jr. was so sufficiently warned in ad­vance of the oncoming train that it was
incumbent upon him to avoid a possible accident and this consisted simply in
stopping his vehicle before the crossing and allowing the train to move
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A prudent man under similar
circumstances would have acted in this manner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, unfortunately, <span class="SpellE">Corliss</span>, Jr. failed to
do."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

(1894).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negligence as a concept has a
well-understood meaning in both American and Spanish law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be amiss to state that according
to the prevailing American doctrine, there is an objective test for negligence
which according to 2 Harper and James in their treatise on The Law of Torts
(1956), citing the Restatement of Torts is "conduct * * * which falls
below the standard established by law for the protection of others against
unreasonable risk of harm." (At p. 896).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prosser on Torts, the third edition of which was published in 1964, is
of the same mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(At p. 149).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Terry and Edgerton viewed the matter
similarly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cf. Terry, Negligence, 29 <span class="SpellE">Har<span style="">v</span></span><span style="">.</span> Law Re<i>v.</i> 40 (1915);
Edgerton, Negligence, Inadvertence and Indifference, 39 <span class="SpellE">Har<span style="">v</span></span><span style="">.</span> Law Re<i>v.</i> 849 (1926).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The above authors show the influence of Holmes in their definitions of
the Law of Negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accord­ing to
Holmes in his classic, The Common Law (1881):<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Thus the standard represents the general level of moral judgment
of the community, what it feels ought ordinarily to be done, and not
necessarily what is ordinarily done, although in practice the two would every
often ear, come to same thing.” (At p. 110).</p>
