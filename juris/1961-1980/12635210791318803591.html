				<H3>JOSE T. GALVEZ, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE
PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> was
indicted for the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City branch of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; upon arraignment on January 26, 1960, he pleaded not
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial of the case was a
protracted one, spanning a period of more than two years, interspersed by
several postpone­ments granted at the behest of both the Government and the
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not until February 6,
1962 that the prosecution's case came to a close with the presentation of its
last three witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
forthwith requested the trial court for two weeks' time within which to ready
its own case, but the request was denied on the ground that the court had
previously ordered a day-to-day hearing until termination of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on the follow­ing day,
February 7, the defense's reiteration of its bid for time suffered a rebuff
from the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of the
failure of the defense to present its case, the court ordered <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> to appear on the following day for pronouncement of
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 8 the defense
filed a written motion for reconsideration; this was denied in open court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a last resort, the defense moved the court
for deferment of the pronouncement of judgment until a <span style="">remedy could be had from a superior court, but this was rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the trial court dated
February 7 was then read, convicting the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
of the crime charged and sentencing him accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately thereafter, the court ordered his
incarceration in the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City jail, but he was
freed following his filing of a notice of appeal and an appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 7, 1964 the respondent Court of
Appeals rendered a decision, affirming the judgment of the trial court in its
entirety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the present appeal
by certiorari on pure questions of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the respondent Court of Appeals sums up the
evidence for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that sometime in early 1959 <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> offered the
husband of the complainant Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> an
exchange deal for the spouses' car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About a week later, <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> showed the <span class="SpellE">Camaras</span> a station wagon, but this made no impression on the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Camaras</span> were shown another car<span style=""> at the Clark Field air base which they readily liked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before consummating its purchase, however,
the <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> spouses asked <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>,
whom they brought along to the air base, for an estimate of the customs duties
and other taxes which they would have to pay upon acquisition of the
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
volunteered that he could settle the tax liabilities by the application of mere
<span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certi­ficates which could be bought with the
relatively small sum of P2,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 24, 1959, following the purchase of the car, Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> delivered to <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> a bank
check, payable to the latter, in the sum of P2,000, representing the amount
which <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> said would <span style="">be required for the purchase of <span class="SpellE">backpay</span>
certificates which in turn would be used to pay for the car's tax
obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
cashed the check shortly thereafter at the <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>
branch of the Philippine Trust Com­pany in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some delay, <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
gave Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> a certificate of registration
supposedly issued by the Motor Vehicles Office (now Land Transportation
Commission) and a set of plate numbers for the newly acquired car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four months later, however, the <span class="SpellE">Camaras</span> got wind of information that the taxes due on their
car had not been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out,
after verification, that the Informal Entry 663582 appearing in the MVO file of
their car did not corres­pond to the proper entry number in the Bureau of
Customs files.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Camara</span>
lost no time in communicating with <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> and
demanding of the latter the return of her money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, for his
part, allegedly replied that he had given the money to another person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The present appeal presents two questions for resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first relates to the territorial competence
of the trial court; the second relates to the right of <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
to a day in court.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. At the trial of this case, the prosecution proved that the
check for P2,000 was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> by <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> at the latter's house in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner admits that he cashed the same
check at the <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span> branch of the Philippine Trust
Company in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> now calls our
attention to the phraseology of the information filed against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about April 24, 1959, in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
said accused, Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, having then induced and
persuaded Feli­ciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span>, thru false
manifestations and frau­dulent representations, to the effect that he would <span style="">be able to pay the full and legal taxes due
the govern­ment from the car of Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span>,
thru <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> certificates, when in truth and in fact
he knew fully well that the amount of P2,000.00 is not suffi­cient, did then
and there receive from said Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> the
amount </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">P2,</span><span style="">000.00 with the understand­ing that the herein accused would pay to the
govern­ment for and on behalf of Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> the
full and legitimate taxes due her Chevrolet Station </span><span style="">wagon, </span><span style="">but the herein accused, once in possession of said amount and far from
complying with his obligation to pay the lawful and legal taxes of the said car
of Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> with the money he had thus re­ceived
in trust or for administration, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously convert, misappropriate and misapply the said amount to his
personal use and benefit, and refused and still refuses to account for said
money despite repeated demands made on him by Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Camara</span>,
to the damage and prejudice of the latter in the aforemen­tioned amount of
P2,000.00."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petitioner points out that, according
to the evidence, the only related transaction that took place within the
territorial jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
is the delivery of the check for P2,000 to <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
information above-quoted, upon the other hand, does not allege that it was a
check <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> had received and converted to his own
use, something which he could<span style=""> </span>have
done only by negotiating the same thru <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evi­dent subject-matter of the
information, the petitioner assumes, is the conversion of the P2,000 received
by <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> in cash from the bank in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner argues, and the Solicitor
General concedes, that the delivery of the check to <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>,
understood in the light of the above reasoning, is not an essential element of
the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charged in the information and, although
occurring in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, did not bring the case
within the territorial competence of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it
is suggested that since the money allegedly converted by <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
was actually received by him in cash the City of Manila, the action should have
been there <span style="">commenced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's attempt at drawing a hairline distinction
between the conversion of a check and the conversion of cash in rela­tion to
the formal allegation in the information of conversion of a specific sum of
money, is remarkable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are, however,
not persuaded that the distinction materially alters the substance of the
indictment, nor does it affect the efficacy of the prosecution's evidence, for
the reasons hereunder stated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Firstly,</u> the information alleges that <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
had received the sum of P<span style="">2,</span>000
from <span class="SpellE">Camara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The phrase "amount of P2,000.00" is broad enough to refer to
either cash or a negotiable instrument.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A check, after all, while not regarded as legal tender, is normally
accepted, under commercial usage, as a substitute for cash.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Further, the credit represented by it in stated monetary value is pro­perty
capable of appropriation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>Secondly</u>, it is erroneous for the petitioner to assume that he was in
receipt of <span class="SpellE">Camara's</span> money only from the time when and
at the place where he cashed the check.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ap­plying the principles of civil law on payments done thru the use of
bills of exchange,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the delivery to <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> of the check on April 24, 1959
in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, had the effect, when the same was
subsequently cashed, of transferring as of that date and in that place, the sum
covered thereby from the drawer to the payee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, although the change from check to public notes took place at a
later date and at another <span class="SpellE">situs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <u>finally,</u> the delivery by <span class="SpellE">Camara</span> of the check in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City
and its acceptance by <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> signified not merely the
transfer to the accused of money belonging to the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also marked, as shown by the chain of
events established by the prosecution, the creation of a fiduciary relation
between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of
such relation either in the form of a trust, commis­sion or administration, is,
of course, an essential element of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
by misappropriation or conversion.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
To put it else-wise, <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> is a continuing crime and
the receipt by the accused of the check in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City
and his cashing of the same shortly there­after in Manila form part of the
events that make up the body of the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule that a criminal prosecution shall be instituted in the place where the
offense or any of its essential ingredients was committed is thereby satisfied.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. We now come to the second question posed by the peti­tioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court's rejection of the petitioner's motion for a
two-week postponement following the arrival of his turn to present his evidence
is here assailed as unreasonable and as amounting to a denial of his right to
be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>First</u>, it is contended
that the lower court's order resetting the trial for <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1962</st1:date> and thereafter from day to day
until the case would be fully terminated, was given in open court on <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1962</st1:date> in the absence of
counsel and without subsequent written notice to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the petitioner argues, he
was not able to anticipate the arrival of his turn to present his defense and
could not have readied himself for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Second</u>,
it is pointed out that, in any event, the accused had no notion that the
prosecution would close its case on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="2">February
 6, 1962</st1:date>, and he would need no less than two weeks from that time to
organize his evidence and secure, by court process or otherwise, the attendance
of his witnesses or the production of essential documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The totality of the foregoing reasons, however, fails to persuade
us that the petitioner was denied his day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the order resetting the trial for February 6, 1962 and
thereafter from day to day until the trial's termination was announced in open
court and in the presence of only the petitioner, it is to be assumed that his
counsel had actual notice thereof for the latter ap­peared in court on the new
date set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the record shows
that the hearing scheduled for <st1:date year="1962" day="24" month="1">January
 24, 1962</st1:date> was ordered can­celled by the court at the instance of the
petitioner himself due to the absence of his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the latter's duty to check with the
court respecting the outcome of that hearing at which he failed to appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any claim to the contrary,
it is to be presumed that this he did in the exercise of the diligence required
of him as an officer of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the claim that the petitioner was deprived of the oppor­tunity
to prepare his defense thru the denial of his motion for post­ponement, we
agree with the respondent Court of Appeals that two years were more than enough
time for this purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is one
of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, and the transaction involved therein is
not a complicated one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused could
be properly expected to anticipate, before his turn came, what course his
defense would ultimately take and what evidence would be required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim that the accused <span style="">needed time to secure the attendance of his
witnesses flies in the face of the fact that he made no request for a subpoena
and/or a subpoena <span class="SpellE"><u>duces</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>tecum</u></span>
on February 6, 1962, the date the prosecution closed its case, or on the
following day which was the day he was scheduled to present his evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, in his motion for new trial
filed with this Court, the accused annexed a copy of his affidavit revealing in
detail his version of the circumstances that led to his being charged in
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the same shows that </span><span style="">he had intended to testify on his own behalf
regarding matters peculiarly within his own personal knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, on the </span><span style="">date set </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the reception </span><span style="">of his evidence, he dared not come forward to testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, an accused is not bound to testify on
his own behalf and his silence may not be taken against him,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but in this case, the petitioner's belated
attempt at this very late day to have his version admitted makes him vulnerable
to the charge that his application for continuance made on February 6 and 7,
1962 was not founded on good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
rule, it is only in cases of clear arbitrariness that this Court will interfere
with the trial court's exercise of dis­cretion in granting or denying a motion
for postponement.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We do </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">find such
arbitrariness in the present case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All the grounds relied upon by the petitioner in his motion for
new trial dated November 9, 1964 filed with this Court have all been discussed
at length above, and further comment thereon will serve no useful purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, we affirm the decision of the respondent
Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1964</st1:date>
and consequently deny the petitioner's motion for new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the petitioner.</p>
