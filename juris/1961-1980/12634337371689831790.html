of Appeals filed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span> Cement
Industries, Inc. as lessee of the co-petitioner, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>,
had its origin in the issuance of a preliminary and mandatory injunction issued

Respondents, represented by the Solicitor General after obtaining four
extensions, submitted on <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1979</st1:date>
the following Manifestation and Motion, which insofar pertinent, reads as
follows: "2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for <i>certiorari</i>
in the Court of Appeals assailed the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction in Land Registration Case No. N-361, Court of First Instance of La
Union, on the ground that the same was issued in <span style="">excess </span>of jurisdiction and with grave
abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid preliminary injunction was
issued after the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed in Land Registration Case No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>N-361
a motion dated <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1962</st1:date>
for the cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. 0-361 in the name of
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That motion stemmed from a finding that the parcel of land covered by <span style="">Original Certificate of Title No. 0-361 in
the name </span>of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> and leased by him to
herein petitioner is within the limits of <span style="">Camp
</span>Wallace Military Reservation and was registered as early as 1906 in
favor of the United States Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The preliminary injunction commanded petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span>
Cement to restore a fence which it had earlier removed from the aforementioned
parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the aforesaid petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court of Appeals, the
Court of First Instance of La Union, in an order dated February 1, 1963, ruled
that the proceedings in Land Registration Case No. N-361, as well as Original
Certificate of Title No. 0-381 in the name of Rafael <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>
issued by virtue of the decree of registration dated <st1:date year="1958" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1958</st1:date> issued in said case, were null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same order, the Register of
Deeds of La Union was ordered to cancel Original Certificate of Title No. 0-381
and/or such other certificates of title as might have been issued subsequent
thereto having reference <span style="">to </span>the
same parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rafael <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span> and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacnotan</span> Cement
appealed the order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">January 25,
 1965</st1:date> to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in its decision dated <st1:date year="1973" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1973</st1:date> the appealed order,
finding the same to be in accordance with law and the evidence presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1974</st1:date>, Assistant Provincial
Fiscal Romeo O. <span class="SpellE">Nebriaga</span> filed a motion for execution
of judgment with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finding the motion to be meritorious, the court granted the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> motion in an order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court took into consideration the fact that the order dated <st1:date year="1965" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1965</st1:date> had become final and
<span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, pursuant to the April 22, 1974 order of the Court of First
Instance of La Union, together with the orders dated February 1, 1963 and
January 25, 1965, including the decision of the Court of Appeals dated August
14, 1973, a writ of execution was issued, ordering the Provincial Sheriff of La
Union, or his deputy, to execute the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portions of the orders and decision quoted in the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
clearly appears therefore that the resolution of the petition in the case at
bar, which merely involves the incident on the preliminary injunction issued in
Land Registration Case No. N-361, would serve no useful purpose since in its
decision on the merits, the trial court has declared <span style="">O.C. </span>T. No. 0-381 <span style="">null and
void and that decision is now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>[Wherefore], it is most respectfully
prayed that the instant petition be dismissed for having become moot and
academic."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the above, it is manifest that this suit is moot and
academic.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review a
decision of respondent Court of Appeals is dismissed for being moot and
