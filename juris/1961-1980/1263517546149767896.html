				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A certiorari and prohibition proceeding was filed by petitioner
Bienvenido P. Buan on May 10, 1968, the respondents being Nicolas Y. Feliciano
and the Honorable Arturo B. Santos, Judge of the Court of First Instance of
Tarlac, Branch II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was </span>sought in such petition to declare
that respondent Judge was devoid of jurisdiction to entertain <span style="">or act on a </span>counter-protest and motion
to dismiss filed by respondent Feliciano and to issue a writ of certiorari <span style="">annulling </span>the order of respondent
Judge of February 19, 1968 <span style="">ordering the
</span>striking out of the answer of respondent Feliciano but refusing to
dismiss his counter-protest on the ground of <span style="">the liberality </span>of the law as well as a writ of prohibition <span style="">commanding </span>respondent Judge to desist
from further enter­taining or acting on such counter-protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in a resolution of <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1968</st1:date>, required respondents to
answer and at the same time issued a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1968</st1:date>, the answer was filed by
respondents sustaining the jurisdiction of the Honorable Arturo B. Santos and
seeking the dismissal of this petition for <span style="">certiorari and prohibition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As early as <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="7">July 24,
 1968</st1:date>, there was a motion to postpone filed by counsel for
petitioner on the ground that respondent Nicolas Y<span style="">. </span>Feliciano died on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="10">October <span style="">16, </span>1970</st1:date>, it was stated in a
resolution of this Court that information was received by it to the effect that
petitioner Bienvenido P. Buan had likewise died in the meanwhile and requiring
counsel to show cause, on the assumption that such information is true, why
this case should not be dismissed as moot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then came, on November 23, 1970, a motion to dismiss filed by counsel
for petitioner manifesting that since petitioner and <span style="">respondent Nicolas Y. Feliciano are both deceased, this proceeding
should be dismissed as moot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
