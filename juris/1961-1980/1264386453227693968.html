First Instance of Manila granting the petition for prohibition and mandamus 
filed by Choy King Tee alias Chua King Tee.</p>
<p>The record shows that <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> husband, Tan Ban 
<span class="SpellE">Seng</span>, a native of 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, was 
granted Philippine citizenship by naturalization on <st1:date month="1" day="13" year="1959">January 13, 1959</st1:date> and took his oath of allegiance on 
<st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1961">January 21, 1961</st1:date>. <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, also Chinese and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, first came to the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
1955. Since then she had gone to and returned from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> several times, the last time she returned being in 
January 1960, when she was admitted here as a temporary visitor. Her authorized 
stay expired on <st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1961">February 14, 
1961</st1:date>.</p>
<p>On January 27, 1961 Tan Ban <span class="SpellE">Leng</span>, in his own behalf 
and in behalf of his wife, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> herein, and of his 
son, Jacinto Chua Tan, filed a petition with the Commissioner of Immigration 
asking him to recognize petitioners as citizens of the Philippines, to cancel 
their alien certificates of registration and to issue in their favor respective 
identification certificates as Philippine citizens. The petition was granted 
insofar as Tan Ban <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> and his son were concerned, 
but was denied as to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>. On <st1:date month="2" day="8" year="1961">February 8, 1961</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed in the lower court a petition for prohibition 
and mandamus with preliminary injunction, praying that she be declared a citizen 
of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
that the Commissioner of Immigration <span class="GramE">be</span> ordered to 
cancel her alien certificate of registration.</p>
<p>The trial court ruled that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> automatically 
acquired Philippine citizenship upon her husband's naturalization and ordered 
the Commissioner to cancel her alien certificate of registration and to issue in 
lieu thereof an identification certificate as Philippine citizen.</p>
<p>In this appeal the Commissioner claims that the lower court erred (1) in 
holding that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> automatically became a 
Philippine citizen upon her husband's <span class="GramE">naturalization</span> 
and (2) in granting the petition for prohibition and mandamus.</p>
<p>Appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> are in disagreement as to 
the meaning of Section 15 of the Naturalization Law, which provides that "any 
woman who is now or may hereafter be married to a citizen of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and 
who might herself be lawfully naturalized shall be deemed a citizen of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>." 
Appellant contends that for an alien woman to avail of his provision she must 
first prove that she has all the qualifications and none of the 
disqualifications for naturalization. On the other hand' <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> maintains that all she has to show is that she has 
none of the disqualifications, as she claims to have done in this case.</p>
<p>The question has been settled by the uniform ruling of this Court in a number 
of cases. The alien wife of a Filipino citizen must first prove that she has all 
the qualifications required by Section 2 and none of the disqualifications 
enumerated in Section 4 of the Naturalization Law before she may be deemed a 
Philippine citizen (Lao <span class="SpellE">Chay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Calang</span>, L-19977, Oct. 30, 1964, citing Lo San Tuan vs. <span class="SpellE">Calang</span>, L-18775, Nov. 30, 1963; Sun Peck Young vs. 
Commissioner of Immigration, L-20784, Dec. 27, 1963; <span class="SpellE">Siok</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> vs. Vivo, L-21136, 
December 27, 1963). The writer of this opinion has submitted the question anew 
the court for a possible re-examination of the said ruling the light of the 
interpretation of a similar law in the States after which Section 15 of our 
Naturalization law was patterned. That law was section 2 of the Act of <st1:date month="2" day="10" year="1855">February 10, 1855</st1:date> (Section 1994 of the 
Revised of the U.S.) The local law, Act No. 3448, was passed on <st1:date month="11" day="30" year="1928">November 30, 1928</st1:date> as an amendment to 
the former Philippine Naturalization Law, Act No. 2927, which was approved on 
<st1:date month="3" day="26" year="1920">March 26, 1920</st1:date>. Under this 
Naturalization Law, acquisition of Philippine citizenship was limited to three 
classes of persons: (a) natives of the Philippines who were not citizens 
thereof; (b) natives of the other insular possessions of the United States; and 
(c) citizens of the United States or foreigners who, under the laws of the 
United States, may become citizens of the latter country if residing therein. 
The reference in subdivision (c) to foreigners who may become American citizens 
is restrictive in character, for only persons of certain specified races were 
qualified <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>. In other words, in so far as 
racial restrictions were concerned there was at the time a similarity between 
the naturalization laws of the two countries, and hence there was reason to 
accord here persuasive force to the interpretation given in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> to 
the statutory provision concerning the citizenship of alien women marrying 
American citizens.</p>
<p>This Court, however, believes that such reason has ceased to exist since the 
enactment of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) on 
<st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1939">June 17, 1939</st1:date>. The racial 
restrictions have been eliminated in this Act, but the provision found in Act 
No. 3448 has been maintained. It is logical to presume that when Congress chose 
to retain the said provision—that to be deemed a Philippine citizen upon 
marriage the alien wife must be one "who might herself be lawfully 
naturalized,”—the reference is no longer to the class or race to which the woman 
belongs, for class or race has become immaterial, but to qualifications and 
disqualifications for naturalization as enumerated in Sections 2 and 4 of the 
statute. Otherwise the requirement that the woman "might herself be lawfully 
naturalized" would be meaningless <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span>, contrary 
to settled norms of statutory construction.</p>
<p>The rule laid down by this Court in this and in cases heretofore decided is 
believed to be in line with national policy of selective admission to Philippine 
citizenship, which after all is a privilege granted only to those who are found 
worthy thereof, and not indiscriminately to anybody at all on the basis alone of 
marriage to a man who is a citizen of the Philippines, irrespective of moral 
character, ideological beliefs, and identification with Filipino ideals, customs 
and traditions.</p>
<p><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> here having failed to prove that she has 
all the qualifications for naturalization, even, indeed, that she has none of 
the disqualifications, she is not entitled to recognition as a Philippine 
citizen.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the petition denied, with costs 
against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.</p>
