<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Petitioners sued for a writ of 
mandamus in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to 
compel respondent Municipal Judge to execute his decision in Civil Case No. 
<span class="GramE">R-5912.</span> The writ was granted and respondents instituted 
the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision appealed from was 
rendered on a stipulation of the parties. From the said stipulation as well as 
from the annexes which were made integral parts thereof, the following facts 
appear base <span class="GramE">No</span>. R-5912 was one for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> filed by <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> <span class="SpellE">Abellana</span> and his wife against the spouses <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcober</span> and <span class="SpellE">Esteleta</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcober</span>. The property 
involved was a 200 square-meter portion of lot No. 5600 of the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> cadastre. A certain <span class="SpellE">Agripina</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span> intervened in 
the action, alleging that she was the owner of the portion occupied by the 
defendants and that the plaintiffs' property was a different portion of the same 
cadastral lot. The municipal court in its decision found that the allegation was 
not true, but that the defendants had leased the land occupied by them from 
<span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>, believing in good faith that she was the 
owner; that the lease was for a period of four years, at a yearly rental of 
P20.00; and that the defendants had paid in full to <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span> the four-year rents of P80.00 and had built a house 
of strong materials on the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">Upon such findings, the municipal 
court fixed a five-year lease between the plaintiffs and the defendants, to 
start on January 1, 1961, at a yearly rental of P50.00, from which P20.00 was to 
be deducted every year for the first four years in view of the fact that the 
defendants had already paid P80.00 to <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>, who in 
turn was ordered to pay the same to the plaintiffs. The sum of P30.00 (after the 
deduction of P20.00) was to be paid during the first week of January every year 
from 1961 to 1964, and the final rent of F50.00 was to be paid during the same 
period of 1965. "If they (the defendants, fail to pay the said sums as 
above-stated,‚Äù the municipal court further adjudged, "then execution shall issue 
against them to vacate the premises in question and to return the possession 
thereof to the plaintiffs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision of the municipal 
court, respondent Judge presiding, was rendered on </span><st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1960"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">November 29, 
1960</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and 
became final on the following December 22, no appeal having been taken by either 
party. On </span><st1:date month="1" day="10" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">January 10, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;"> the 
plaintiffs filed a motion for execution on the ground that the defendants had 
failed to pay the rent of P30.00 during the first week of that month, as ordered 
in the judgment. On January 30 the defendants deposited the said amount in 
court, which thereupon denied the motion for execution in an order dated the 
next day, January 31. A motion for reconsideration was filed by the plaintiffs 
and was likewise denied by the court. The order of denial, dated 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1961"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">February 13, 
1961</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">, was 
submitted as Annex D to the stipulation of the parties before the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> in 
the present action for mandamus, and gives the following reason: 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">"... a slight delay on the part 
of defendants <span class="SpellE">Alcober</span> in the payment of the rent does 
not make said defendants negligent in the performance of their duties, because 
the delay of the payment was due not to their voluntary desire not to pay but to 
the fact that there was a certain negotiation between defendant <span class="SpellE">Alcober</span> and herein plaintiffs going on at the time and at 
the initiative of the plaintiffs for the barter of the land occupied by said 
defendants <span class="SpellE">Alcober</span> for their own land located just in 
front of or very near to said land occupied by 
them."<o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After their motion for 
reconsideration was denied the plaintiffs initiated the instant case of 
mandamus. The Court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> 
granted the writ prayed for, applying Rule 72, Section B (of the old Rules of 
Court) respecting execution pending appeal in cases of forcible entry or illegal 
<span class="SpellE">detainer</span> where the defendant-appellant fails to pay 
the current rentals. The Court's reliance on the said rule is erroneous. The 
case before it was an original action for mandamus and not an appeal from the 
decision of the municipal Court in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case. 
The decision had already become final. The only question was whether the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof, stating that in case of failure 
of the defendants to pay the rents as therein adjudged "execution shall issue 
against them to vacate the <span class="GramE">premises.</span> . . ," should be 
implemented and carried out because the defendants failed to pay the 1961 rent 
within the first week of January, and did so only on January 
30.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The Court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> considered the issuance of a writ 
of execution as ministerial duty of respondent Judge, there being "no showing 
that the delay in the payment of the rentals, as provided in the decision, was 
due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence." <span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> now contend that a conclusion of fact such as this 
is not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by us on appeal, since only 
questions of law may be raised (Sec. 17, par. 6, R. A. No. 296). This is true as 
a general rule, but the same is not without qualification. It does not apply 
where the Court, in arriving at its conclusion, has manifestly overlooked or 
disregarded certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties which, if 
properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this case the stipulation of 
facts submitted by the parties to the Court <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> included, as an integral part 
thereof, the order of the municipal court of February 13, 1961, in which it 
found that the delay of the defendants was not voluntary, but was due to the 
negotiation initiated by the plaintiffs for the barter of certain properties 
respectively owned by them. The submission of the said order to the Court 
<em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">a quo</span></em> as part of the 
stipulation is an admission of its factual basis, and such fact need no longer 
be specifically pleaded and proven by the respondents in the subsequent action 
for mandamus, where the only question involved was whether or not upon the facts 
found by the Municipal Court its duty to issue a writ of execution was mandatory 
and ministerial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">After a judgment has become 
final, if there is evidence of an event or circumstance which would affect or 
change the rights of the parties thereto, the court should be allowed to admit 
evidence of such new facts and circumstances, and thereafter suspend its 
execution and grant relief as the new facts and circumstances warrant (<span class="SpellE">Candelario</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Ca√±izares</span>, 114, Phil. 672; citing City of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. Ortiz, 113 Phil. 636; see also 
(<span class="SpellE">Pe√±uela</span> <em><span style="font-family: Verdana;">vs</span></em>. <span class="SpellE">Hornada</span>, 
111 Phil. 618). In the case of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> decided by 
respondent Judge here such facts were found by him to exist, and no appeal was 
taken from that finding. His duty to execute the judgment, under the 
circumstances, was not ministerial and could not be compelled by a proceeding in 
mandamus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana;">The decision appealed from is 
reversed, with costs against petitioner-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
