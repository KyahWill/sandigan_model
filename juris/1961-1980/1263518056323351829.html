from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
in its Civil Case No. 1971 (for declaratory relief), where­in the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> declared null and void and <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>
the said city's Ordinance No. 7 - imposing a tax (denominated as a license fee
in the Ordinance) on any person, company, partnership or corporation engaged in
"the operation or manufacture or sale of electric light or electric heat
or electric power" within the limits of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
City - and enjoined the city officials concerned from enforcing the Ordinance
in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Com­monwealth Act No. 487, dated <st1:date year="1939" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1939</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp; Power Company, Inc. was granted a
legislative franchise to construct, maintain and operate a plant for the
purpose of generating and distributing electric light, heat and power for sale
within the limits of the municipality (now city) of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>
for a period of twenty-five (25) years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said grant provided, among others, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subject to
the terms and conditions established in Act Numbered Thirty-six hundred and
thirty-six, as amended by Commonwealth Act Numbered One hundred and thirty-two,
and to the provisions of the Constitution, there is granted to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light and Power Com­pany, Incorporated, for a
period of twenty-five years from the approval of this Act, the right, privilege
and authority to construct, main­tain and operate an electric light, heat, and
power plant for the pur­pose of generating and distributing electric light,
heat, or power for sale within the limits of the muni­cipality of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Section 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
expressly pro­vided that in the event the Govern­ment should desire to maintain

grantee shall surrender its franchise and will turn over to the Government all
serviceable equipments therein, at cost.</blockquote>

is declared null and void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of Act 3636 (as amended by Com­monwealth Act No.
132) referred to above, so far as pertinent to the present case, read:</p>

real estate, buildings, plants, machinery, and other personal pro­perty, except
property declared exempt in this section.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In consideration of the franchise and rights hereby granted, the grantee
shall pay into the municipal trea­sury of the (of each) municipality in which
it is supplying electric current to the public under this franchise, a tax
equal to two per centum of the <u>gross</u> <u>earnings</u> from electric
current sold or supplied under this franchise in said (each said)
municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said tax shall be due and
payable quarterly and shall be in lieu of any and all tax­es of any kind,
nature or descrip­tion levied, established, or col­lected by any authority
whatsoever, municipal, provincial, or insular, now or in the future, on its
poles, wires, insulators, switches, trans­formers and structures, installa­tions,

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp; Power Company,
Inc., being en­gaged in the operation and sale of electric power, heat and
light in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename>

was ad­vised by the treasurer of the city of the enactment of Ordinance No. 7
and, at the same time, requested to cooperate in the implementation thereof.
The company hedged; in its letter dated February 6, 1963, it called the
attention of the City Treasurer to the term "kilowatt" used in the
ordinance, and informed the said official that the ordinance did not pertain to
it because the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp; Power Company
sells electricity not by the "kilowatts" but by the
"kilowatt-hours".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after
the treasurer of the city had subsequently advised it that the
"kilowatt" referred to in the ordinance was intended to mean
"kilowatt-hour" as reflected in Resolution No. 61, Series of 1963 of
the Municipal Board of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City, however, the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp; Power Company refused to pay and made
it plain in its letter of September 1, 1964 that it could not comply with the
ordinance be­cause it believed the same to be <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then filed the present action for
declaratory relief before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in view of the
insistence of the offi­cials of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City
concerned to enforce the ques­tioned ordinance against it; and, as stated in
the open­ing paragraph of this opinion, the trial court rendered judgment in
its favor and against the City of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> and its
officials, with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> por­tions:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of all the facts and the law <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>,
it seems clear that Ordinance No. 7, series of 1962, of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City, is a tax ordinance, not a license fee; that
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City can­not enact Ordinance
No. 7 imposing a tax upon the plaintiff under Section 2(d) of the Local Autonomy
Act be­cause said tax is expressly prohibi­ted under Section 2(j) of the Local
Autonomy Act with respect to the plaintiff which is paying a franchise tax to
the government; that independ­ent of Section 2(j) of the Local Auto­nomy Act,
the Plaintiff is legally exempted from paying the tax imposed by Ordinance No.
7 by virtue of the express exemption in Section 10 of Act No. 3636, as amended
which is expressly incorporated in Republic Act No. 3217; that if the levy in
Ordinance No. 7 is considered as a li­cense fee, the same would be null and
void for being clearly excessive, and therefore, unjust, pursuant to Section 2
of the Local Autonomy Law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the
plaintiff a­gainst the defendants:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring Ordinance No. 7 a tax measure,

measure, as null and void and ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span>, by virtue

Act No. 3217, the legislative franchise of the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring said Ordinance No. 7, if considered
as a police regulation measure, null and void, for imposing a clearly
excessive, hence unjust, license fees, con­trary to Section 2 of the Local
Autonomy Act.</blockquote>

Ordinance No. 7 against the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Without pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this decision of the lower court, the City of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> et al. has taken the present appeal, claiming
that:</p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT

FRANCHISE TAX IS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY SECTION 2 (j) OF REPUBLIC ACT NO.

NULL AND VOID AND ULTRA VIRES, AND IN ENJOINING DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS FROM
ENFORCING THE SAID ORDINANCE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly put by appellants, the real issues are (1) whether
or not Ordinance No. 7 of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cota­bato</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
earlier quoted, is valid; and (2) if so, whether or not the said ordinance can
legally be enforced against the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp;
Power Company, Incorporated.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is pointed out by appellants that the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place></st1:city> is legally possessed of
the necessary power and authority to enact the ordinance under
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Re­liance is placed upon
the provisions of Section 2(d) of the Local Autonomy Act We have previously
quoted, provid­ing that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
all chartered cities x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
shall have authority to impose municipal license taxes or fees upon persons
engaged in any occupation or business, or exercising privileges in chartered
cities x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> by requiring
them to secure licenses at rates fixed by the mu­nicipal board or city council
of the city, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and
otherwise to levy for public purposes, just and uniform taxes, licenses or
fees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Provided, however, that no city x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> may levy or impose x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> taxes on persons operating waterworks, irrigation and
other public utilities except electric light, heat and power".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these, they argue that there should be
no doubt about the power of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place></st1:city> to levy taxes on persons
engaged in the business of electric light, heat and power; and since <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp;
Power Company is en­gaged in such business within <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
it has no reason to complain against Ordinance No. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, on the
other hand, contends that while the provisions of Section 2(d) of the Local
Autonomy Act relied upon by appel­lants so provide, Section 2(j) of the same
law ordains that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
no city x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> may levy or
impose x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> taxes of any kind on banks, insurance companies, and
persons paying franchise tax"; and since it is already continuously and
regularly paying the 2% franchise tax provided for in <span class="SpellE">thelaw</span>
which granted its franchise, it maintains that appellant City of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> is devoid of any authority to levy upon it the tax
imposed by its Ordinance No. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
force of both arguments demands that We take a second look at the legal
provisions invoked by them, if only to get a clearer view of the
controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For em­phasis, We again
quote the pertinent portions of the Local Autonomy Act involved:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taxation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any provision of law to the contrary
notwithstand­ing, all chartered cities, municipa­lities and municipal districts
shall have authority to impose municipal license taxes or fees upon persons
engaged in any occupation or business, of exercising privileges in chartered
cities, municipalities or munici­pal districts by requiring them to secure
licenses at rates fixed by the municipal board or city council of the city, the
municipal council of the municipality, or the munici­pal district council of
the munici­pal district; to collect fees and charges for services rendered by
the city, municipality or municipal district; to regulate and impose reasonable

<blockquote>(Underscoring
Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants plead that these provisions should be taken to mean
that all persons already paying franchise taxes are exempt from local taxation,
except when they are engaged in the business of electric light, heat and
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they argue in their brief:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"It is difficult to understand how paragraph (d), with
specific reference to electric light, heat and power, which to all intent and
purposes is an except­ion to an exception, can be viewed as a general
provision, and <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span>, how paragraph (j) can be
considered as a spe­cial provision. There would be more sense and logic, we
submit, in treating paragraph (j) as a general provision in­sofar as persons
paying franchise tax are concerned, and paragraph (d), with res­pect to
operators of electric light, heat and power, as a special provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus considering these two paragraphs, the
portions thereof which are pertinent to the present case would be understood to
mean - as the legislature intended them to mean - as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No city, municipality or municipal district
may levy or impose taxes on persons paying franchise tax except where such
persons are opera­tors of electric light, heat and power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This construction would, we believe, give
full effect and meaning to the clear intention of Congress to isolate the busi­ness
of electric light, heat and power from other public utilities on which taxes
may not be imposed by cities, municipa­lities and municipal districts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The phrase 'persons paying franchise tax' in paragraph (j)
can only refer to persons or corporations, other than those engaged in electric
light, heat and power, paying franchise tax, like operators of ice plants,
radio broadcasting stations and television stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specific mention of 'electric light, heat
and po­wer' in paragraph (d) would become idle if not meaningless if persons
engaged in that business and paying franchise tax would be deemed exempt from
the taxing power of lo­cal governments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In enacting Section 2 of Republic Act No.2264, Congress must be presumed
to be cognizant of the fact that the business of electric light, heat and power
is operated under a legislative or municipal franchise, and, therefore,
inevitably subject to the payment of franchise tax. If, this notwithstand­ing,
persons operating this kind of business would be held as included in the term
'persons paying franchise tax' in paragraph (j), then the phrase 'except electric
light, heat and pow­er' in paragraph (d) would be absolutely inoperative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above argument of appellants suffers from a sig­nificant flaw
in its premise that the business of electric light, heat and power is
inevitably subject to the payment of franchise tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no warrant for such contention in
any extant constitutional or statutory provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is perfectly possible for
the legislature or a municipality to grant a franchise without the require­ment
to pay any franchise tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
exemption of franchise holders from any possible municipal tax under Section
2(j) of the Local Autonomy Act is not necessarily repugnant to the power given
to municipalities to tax the business of light, heat and power, under Section
2(d) of said law, assuming that the reference therein to such business
constitutes an exception to the exception.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such business may be taxed so long as it does not pay a franchise tax,
but not in addition to or differently from the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the broadest view of the power of
taxation granted municipal corporations under the Local Autonomy Act cannot
justify appellants' position in the absence of clearer indication of such
intent in its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With­al, the
issue raised by appellants regarding the alleged repeal of the terms and
conditions of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> franchise by Republic Act
2264 is not really new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well reasoned
precedents<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Manila Railroad Co. vs. Rafferty, <u>supra</u>, the
Collector of Internal Revenue, in pursuance of the provisions of Act No. 2432
and subsequent Acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, assessed
against the Manila Railroad Company a tax on coal and oil imported in­to the
Philippines by the said company for its use, which tax, the Manila Railroad
paid under protest on the ground that it was not bound to pay it by reason of
its charter or franchise (Act No. 1510) which required it to pay a certain
percentage tax on its earnings with the proviso that "such payments, when
promptly and fully made, by the grantee shall be in lieu of all taxes of every
name and nature - municipal, provincial, or central - upon its capital, stock,
franchise, right of way, earnings, etc." The prob­lem thus presented was
whether or not said Acts had altered, repealed or amended the company's
charter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]he
question presented above may be stated more concretely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May a special law or charter be amended, al­tered
or repealed by a general law, by implication?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That question has been answered in the negative so many times
that, except for the fact that it has not been raised here before, it would
scarcely be neces­sary to cite authorities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Repeals of laws by implication are not favored; and the mere
repugnance bet­ween two statutes should be very clear in order to warrant the
court in holding that the later in time repeals the other, when it does not in
terms purport to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cooley's

<blockquote>"In the case of McKenna vs. <span class="SpellE">Edmundstone</span>
(91 N.Y., 231) the court said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It is
well settled that a local and special statute, providing for a particular case
or class of cases, is not repealed by a subsequent statute, <u>general in its
terms, provisions and application</u>, unless the intent to repeal or alter is
manifest, although the terms of the general act are broad enough to include the
cases embraced in the special law.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
rule is but the application of the larger rule that a statute is not to be deemed
repealed, by implication, by a subsequent Act upon the same subject unless the
two are manifestly inconsistent with, and repugnant to, each other, or unless a
clear intention is disclosed on the face of the later statute to repeal the
former one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is a canon of statutory construct­ion that a later <u>statute,
general in its terms</u> and not expressly repealing a <u>prior special </u>statute,
will ordinarily not affect the special provisions of such earlier statute. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(Steamboat Company vs. Collector, 18 Wall. [<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>],

<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 373,
396.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where there are two statutes, the earlier special and the
later general - the terms of the general broad enough to include the matter
provided for in the special - the fact that one is special and the other is
general creates a pre­sumption that the special is to be consi­dered as
remaining an exception to the general, one as a general law of the land, the
other as the law of a particu­lar case. (State vs. Stoll, 17 Wall. [<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>],
425.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Said Act No. 1510 is a charter grant­ed to the plaintiff
company by the Go­vernment of the Philippine Islands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the nature of a private
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a law constituting a
part of the machinery of the general government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was adopted after careful consideration of
the private rights of the plaintiff in relation with the resultant benefits to
the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stands upon a different
footing from the general law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a
charter is granted, it constitutes a certain property right. Charters or
special laws, such as Act No. 1510, stand upon a different foot­ing from
general laws. Once granted, a charter becomes a private contract and cannot be
altered nor amended except by consent of all concerned, unless that right is
expressly reserved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Darmouth</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>

is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Legis­lature, in passing a
special charter, have their attention directed to the special facts and
circumstances which the Act or charter is intended to meet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Legislature consider and make provision
for all the circumstances of the particular case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Legislature having specially consider­ed
all of the facts and circumstances in the particular case in granting a special
charter, it will not be considered that the Legislature, by adopting a general
law containing provisions repugnant to the provis­ions of the charter, and
without making any mention of its intention to amend or modify the charter,
intended to amend, repeal, or modify the special act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lewis vs. <st1:place><st1:placename>Cook</st1:placename>

<blockquote>"While the Acts of Congress referred to above contain a
provision that all laws in­consistent with their provisions are repealed, yet
they expressly provide that they shall not affect any accrued right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff had enjoyed the rights granted
under Act No. 1510 for a number of years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such rights were accrued rights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An examination of said Acts of Congress not only fails to disclose any
express intention to amend, alter, or repeal Act No. 1510, or any of its
provisions, but, upon the contrary, we find that the said Acts of Congress
expressly protect all rights there­tofore accrued."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There being obvious parity in the facts and legal pro­visions involved
in the above case and the present one, We hold that the clause "any
provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all chartered cities,
municipalities and municipal districts shall have authority to impose municipal
license taxes or fees" found in Section 2 of Republic Act 2264, did not
alter, amend, nor repeal the terms and con­ditions of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp; Power Company's franchise under
which it was required to pay 2% of its gross earnings "in lieu of any and
all taxes of any kind, nature or description levied, established, or collected
by any authority whatsoever, municipal, provincial, or insular, now or in the
future, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> on its
franchise, rights, privileges, receipts, revenues and profits, from which taxes
the grantee is hereby expressly exempted." Consequently, said terms and
conditions exempt the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Light &amp; Power
Company from the operation of Ordinance No. 7, enacted by the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place></st1:city> pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2 of Republic Act 2264.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the soundness of our conclu­sion on this point is strengthened
by the fact that even after the Local Autonomy Act of 1959 was already in
force, when Congress extended <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> franchise
for another twenty-five years under Republic Act No. 3217 on June 17, 1961, the
said franchise was again expressly made "subject to the terms and
conditions established in Act No. 3636, as amended by C. A. No. 132" which
conclusively shows that the exemption of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
from the imposition of taxes other than its franchise tax was not repealed,
altered, or modified by the provision of the Local Autonomy Act relied upon by
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, another way of
look­ing at the matter is that such exemption was revived, if at all it had
been repealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that the legislature is with­out any
prerogative to alter or modify the terms of any previously granted franchise,
but the revision must, in the first place, conform with the express
reservations made in the grant and, moreover, the intent to amend must be
evident, if not specific.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is no need to declare the ordinance in
question null and void and <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>
by reason of the exemption established in Act 3636 referred to in the
above-named company's franchise. Neither is this the occasion to pass on the
question of whether the said ordinance is a police regulation measure or a pure
tax, although it is apparent from the terms of the ordi­nance that its purpose
is to raise revenue for the City Light Fund, and as such could be considered as
a tax.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>FOR ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision appealed from is
modified in the sense that the portions thereof de­claring Ordinance No. 7 null
and void and <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span> are

affirmed in all other respects, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
