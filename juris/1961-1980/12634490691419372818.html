				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Appeal taken by the
National Marketing Corporation - hereinafter referred to as NAMARCO, from the
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 45770
ordering the </span><span style="">Associated </span><span style="">Finance Company, Inc. - hereinafter referred
to as the ASSOCIATED - to pay the NAMARCO the sum of P403,514.28, with </span>legal
interest thereon from the date of filing of the action until fully paid,
P80,702.26 as liquidated damages, P5,000.00 as attorney's fees, plus costs, but
dismissing the complaint insofar as defendant <span style="">Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> </span>was concerned, as well
as the latter's counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal
is only from that portion of the decision dismissing the case as against
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 25, 1958, ASSOCIATED, a domestic corporation, through
its President, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>,
entered into an agreement to exchange sugar with NAMARCO, represented by its
then General Manager, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, whereby the
former would deliver to the latter 22,516 bags (each weighing 100 pounds) of
"<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>" and/or "National"
refined sugar in exchange for 7,732.71 bags of "<span class="SpellE">Busilak</span>"
and 17,285.08 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of "<span class="SpellE">Pasumil</span>"
raw sugar belonging to NAMARCO, both agreeing to pay liquidated damages
equivalent to 20% of the contractual value of the sugar should either party
fail to comply with the terms and conditions stipulated (Exhibit A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto, on <st1:date year="1958" day="19" month="5"><span style="">May </span>19, 1958</st1:date>,
NAMARCO delivered to ASSOCIATED 7,732.71 bags of "<span class="SpellE">Busilak</span>"
and 17,285.08 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of "<span class="SpellE">Pasumil</span>"
domestic raw sugar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ASSOCIATED failed
to deliver to NAMARCO the 22,516 bags of "<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>"
and/or "National" refined sugar agreed upon, the latter, on January
12, 1959, demanded in writing from the ASSOCIATED either (a) immediate delivery
thereof before January 20, or (b) payment of its equivalent cash value amounting
to P372,639.80.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1959</st1:date>,
ASSOCIATED, through <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, offered to pay NAMARCO the
value of 22,516 bags of refined sugar at the rate of P15.30 per bag, but the
latter rejected the offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In足stead, on
January 21 of the same year, it demanded payment of the 7,732.71 bags of "<span class="SpellE">Busilak</span>" raw sugar at P15.30 per bag, amounting to
P118<span class="GramE">,310.40</span>, and of the 17,285.08 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>
of "<span class="SpellE">Pasumil</span>" raw sugar at P16.50 per <span class="SpellE">picul</span>, amounting to P285,203.82, or a total price of
P403,514.28 for both kinds of sugar, based on the sugar quotations (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) <span class="GramE">as</span> of <st1:date year="1958" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1958</st1:date> - the date when the exchange
agreement was entered into.</p>

<p class="BODY">As ASSOCIATED refused to deliver the raw sugar or pay for the
refined sugar delivered to it, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of repeated
demands therefore, NAMARCO instituted the present action in the lower court to
recover the sum of P403<span class="GramE">,514.28</span> in payment of the raw
sugar received by defendants from it; P80,702.86 as liquidated damages;
P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, expenses of litigation and exemplary damages,
with legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint until fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their amended answer defendants, by way of affirmative
defenses, alleged that the correct value of the sugar delivered by NAMARCO to
them was P259<span class="GramE">,451.09</span> or P13.30 per bag of 100 lbs.
weight (<span class="SpellE">quedan</span> basis) and not P403,514.38 as claimed
by NAMARCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As counterclaim they prayed
for the award of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damages,
P100,000.00 <span style="">as </span>exemplary damages
and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due trial the court
rendered the appealed judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, but on January 15, 1963 the latter
certified the case to Us for final adjudication pursuant to sections 17 and 31
of the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, the amount involved being more than
P200,000.00, exclusive of interests and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue to be resolved is whether, upon the facts found by
the trial court, - which, in our opinion, are fully supported by the evidence -
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> may be held liable, jointly and
severally with his co-defendant, for the sums of money adjudged in favor of
NAMARCO.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of record shows that, of the capital stock of
ASSOCIATED, <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> owned P60,000.00 worth of shares,
while his wife - the second biggest stockholder - owned P20,000.00 worth of
shares; that the par value of the subscribed capital stock of <span style="">ASSOCIATED </span>was only P105,000.00; that
negotiations that lead to the execution of the exchange agreement in question
were conducted exclusively by <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> on behalf of
ASSOCIATED; that, as a matter of fact, in the course of his testimony, <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> referred to himself as the one who contracted or
transacted the business in his personal capacity, and asserted that the
exchange agreement was his personal contract; that it was <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
who made personal representations and gave assurances that ASSOCIATED was in
actual possession of the 22,516 bags of "<span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>"
and/or "National" refined sugar which the latter had agreed to
deliver to NAMARCO, and that the same was ready for delivery; that, as a matter
of fact, <span style="">ASSOCIATED </span>was at that
time already insolvent; that when NAMARCO made written demands upon ASSOCIATED
to deliver the 22,516 bags of refined sugar it was under obligation to de足liver
to the former, ASSOCIATED and <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, instead of
making delivery of the sugar, offered to pay its value at the rate of P15.30
per bag -<span style=""> </span>a clear indication that
they did not have the sugar contracted for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts, fully established by the evidence, can lead
to no other conclusion than that <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> was guilty of
fraud because through false representations he succeeded in inducing NAMARCO to
enter into the aforesaid exchange agreement, with full knowledge, on his part,
of the fact that <span style="">ASSOCIATED </span><span style="">whom he represented and over whose business
and affairs he had absolute control, was in no position to comply with the </span><span style="">obli</span>gation it had assumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he can not now seek refuge
behind the general principle that a corporation has a personality distinct and
separate from that of its stockholders and that the latter are not personally
liable for the corporate obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
the contrary, upon the proven facts, <span class="GramE">We</span> feel perfectly
jus足tified in "piercing the veil of corporate fiction" and in holding
<span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> personally liable, jointly and severally with
his co-defendant, for the sums of money adjudged in favor of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled law in this and other
jurisdictions that when the corporation is the mere <u>alter</u> <u><span style="">ego</span></u><span style=""> </span>of a person, the corporate fiction may be disregarded; the same
being true when the cor足poration is controlled, and its affairs are so
conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency or conduit of another
(Koppel <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>. etc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>
etc., 43 O.G. No. 11, Nov. 1947; <span class="SpellE">Yutivo</span> Sons etc. vs.

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is modified by
sentencing defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Francisco <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> to pay, jointly and severally with the Associated
