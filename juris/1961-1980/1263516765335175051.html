of First Instance of Manila, convicting him of the crime of libel and
sentencing him to pay a fine of P2,000.00, with subsi­diary imprisonment in
case of insolvency, which shall not exceed six (6) months, and to pay the
costs, defendant <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Orfanel</span>
has appealed, by petition for review on certiorari, which has been given due
course.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Upon receipt of this
letter, on <st1:date year="1961" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1961</st1:date>, the
administrative officer of the Bureau of Printing, Jose <span class="SpellE">Marcilla</span>,
turned it over to the Director of Printing, who referred it to his secretary,
Mario <span class="SpellE">Banzuela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the Director of Printing forwarded Exhibit A to the
Departments of General Services for administrative action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a mat­ter of fact, the defendant had
already sent a copy of said letter to the Secretary of General Services. </p>

<p class="BODY">After investigating the charges contained in Exhibit A, the
latter's office submitted its report, Exhibit F, to the Commissioner of Civil
Service, recommending complete exoneration of complainant Jeans <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span>, and the charges against him were, accordingly,
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, complainant
commenced the present criminal action for libel, against defendant <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Orfanel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial, under a plea of not guilty,
the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered the aforementioned judgment of
conviction, imposing the penalty already adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, taken by the defendant, said
judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this petition for review on certiorari.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant maintains that the Court of Appeals has erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not holding that Exhibit A is a
"privileged communication which would exempt the author thereof from
criminal responsibility"; (2) in basing his conviction on a
"presumption of malice"; (3) in failing to hold "that Exhibit A
merely contained an opinion or belief" for which defendant "incurred
no criminal liability"; (4) in holding that the failure of the defense to
present <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> as
a witness "should be taken against" him (defendant); and (5) "in
holding that there had been publication of the letter Exhibit A."</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first assignment of error, it should be noted
that a privileged communication may be either absolutely pri­vileged or
conditionally privileged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
Communication is said to be absolutely privileged when it is not actionable,
even if its author has acted in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This class includes statements made by members of Congress in the
discharge of their functions as such, official com­munications made by public
officers in the performance of their duties, and allegations or statements made
by the parties or their counsel in their pleadings or motions or during the
hearing of judi­cial proceedings, as well as the answers given by witnesses in
reply to questions propounded to them, in the course of said proceedings,
provided that said allegations or statements are relevant to the is­sues, and
the answers are responsive or pertinent to the ques­tions propounded to said
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, condi­tionally
or qualifiedly privileged communications are those which, although containing
defamatory imputations, would not be actionable unless made with malice or bad
faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It has, moreover, been held that there is malice when the defamer has been
prompted by ill-will or spite and speaks not in response to duty, but merely to
injure the reputation of the person defamed.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit A is not an absolutely privileged communication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It belongs to the class of communications regarded
as qualifiedly pri­vileged, pursuant to Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code,
reading:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 354.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Requirement
for publicity</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every defamatory
imputation is presumed to be malicious, even if it be true, if no good
intention and justifiable motive for making it is shown, except in the
following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->A private communication made by any person to
another in he performance of any legal, moral, or social duty; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->A fair and true report, made in good faith,
without any comments or remarks, of any judicial, legislative, or other
official proceedings which are not of confidential nature, or of any statement,
report or speech delivered in said proceedings, or of any other act performed
by public officers in the exercise of their functions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, Exhibit A falls under the first subdivision of
the above-quoted provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being
conditional or qualified, the privileged nature of said communication does not
warrant defendant's acquittal, if he acted in bad faith or with malice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second assignment of error, in effect, raises the question
whether, in convicting the defendant, the Court of Appeals has merely presumed
that he had acted with malice, or found as a fact that he was so motivated in
writing and sending Exhibit A to the Director of Printing and the Secretary of
General Services.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it is not disputed that the imputations made in
Exhibit A are <u>per</u> <u>se</u> defamatory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant testified that he made them in good faith, believing that
it was his duty to send Exhibit A to the Director of Printing; but, the trial
court and the Court of Appeals found his testimony unworthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding is one of fact, which is beyond
our power to review, in this appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court
of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 29 of Republic Act
No. 296 explicitly provides that deci­sions of said Court, when rendered in the
exercise of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction over cases properly brought to
it from Courts of First Instance, "shall be final", subject to the
discretionary power of review by certiorari of the Supreme Court, on questions
of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is well-settled that,
in the exercise of its juris­diction to so review on certiorari decisions of
the Court of Appeals, as distinguished from ordinary appeals or appeals by writ
of error or record on appeal, the findings of fact of that appellate court are
conclusive upon the Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the aforementioned finding of the Court of Ap­peals,
confirmatory of that of the trial court, and holding that de­fendant's
testimony about his alleged good faith can not be accepted on its face value,
and that, on the contrary, he had acted with ma­lice, was not based upon a
presumption of malice, but had been deduced from the following circumstances,
namely:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The imputations contained in his letter Exhibit
A appear to be absolutely groundless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the administrative investigation prompted by said communication
resulted in the complete exoneration of complainant Jesus <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, in the present cri­minal
action, defendant did not even <u>try</u> to prove either the <u>truth</u> of
said imputations, or that there was any <u>semblance</u> of truth therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibit A, defendant said that he had in
his possession a sample copy of the wedding invitation card allegedly
"printed in the Bureau of Printing" and sold by the complainant to <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, defendant did not introduce or offer in
evidence, either the aforementioned sample copy of the invitation or the
testimony of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant did not even explain why he failed
to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he try to prove
that complainant had actually "bought a choice lot in Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span> subdivision" and "a coconut plantation in <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>", in
addition to having "a fat bank account in a bank in Manila", as
alleged in the fourth specification in said Exhi­bit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still, he did not introduce any
evidence of specific facts or circumstances that could have led a reasonably
prudent man to believe honestly and earnestly that said imputations are true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, We have no more than defendant's bare
testimony about his alleged belief in the truth of said imputations and good
faith in mak­ing the same, although he could have introduced evidence in corro­boration
thereof, if his story were true.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The record shows that defendant and complainant
are second cousins and residents of <span class="SpellE">Catanauan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="3">March
 23, 1961</st1:date>, complainant's mother, Maria <span class="SpellE">Orfila</span>,
filed, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, a
civil action against appel­lant's wife, <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Avellanida</span>, and her uncle, Benito <span class="SpellE">Avellanida</span>,
for the recovery of a parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Less than a month and a half later, defendant wrote and sent the letter
Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant would have Us
believe that this communication had nothing to do with said civil action, to which
neither he nor the complainant was a party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, His Honor, the trial Judge, had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>"That defendant was <u>actuated by (4) malice</u> in sending
the letter, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, to the Director of Print­ing is <u>unequivocally
shown by the fact</u> that, although he allegedly completed his inquiries
regarding his charges against the offended party in February, 1961, he did not
send his letter-complaint to the Director of Printing until May 5, 1961,
obviously by way of re­venge and retaliation to the offended party's mother's
filing of a civil action against his, defendant's wife, on March 23, 1961, or
just about 43 days before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In any event, defendant's pretension that he conducted an
investigation into his charges and sent his letter, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A, to the Director of Printing and also another letter of the same tenor to the
Secretary of the Department of General Services only after he came to the . .
in good faith as to the truth thereof, does not have the ring of truth and
sincerity, but of an eleventh hour fabrication to mend broken fences."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals fully shared this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote from the decision appealed from:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
testimony of the appellant that he finished his investigation of the supposed
racketeer­ing activities of the complainant in the Bureau of Printing in
February, 1961, that is, before the com­plaint against his wife was filed by
the mother of the complainant, is <u>not worthy of belief</u> because it is <u>not
supported by any corroborative evidence and could be easily manufactured</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, <u>it was but the easiest thing for
the appellant to say</u> that he finished in Feb­ruary, 1961, his alleged
investigation of the supposed improper activities of the offended party in the
Bureau of Printing but, if this were true, then, <u>why was the appellant
unable to present any witness whom he had interviewed in the course of his
pretended investigation</u> to prove his claim that his supposed investigation
took place before the civil case was filed against his wife by complainant's
mother?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appellant further argues that since he is himself not a
party to the case filed by the complain­ant's mother against his (appellant's)
wife, he has no personal interest in said case and hence, there is no ground
for concluding that he wrote the letter, Each. 'A', with malice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is obviously without merit
because the fruits of the parcel of land, which is the subject matter of the
case against appellant's wife, would be conjugal property of the appellant and
his wife and hence, said case directly affected the interests of
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, not being estranged
from his wife, the appellant would just be following the ordinary course of
human conduct by entertaining an ill-feeling against the mother of the
appellant who filed a case against his wife and it is logical to pre­sume that
the appellant retaliated by writing and send­ing <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'A' to the Director of the Bureau of Printing in order to give vent to his said
ill-feeling."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that the Court of Appeals and the trial court
had plausible reasons to conclude, not merely presume, that defen­dant's
testimony merits no credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
said reasons, and considering that His Honor, the trial Judge, had an
opportunity, de­nied to Us, to observe defendant's <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>
on the witness stand, We are not prepared to disturb the action of both courts
in not be­lieving the defendant and in finding that he had a grudge or
ill-feeling against the complainant, that he had written and sent the letter
Exhi­bit A in retaliation for the civil action aforementioned, and that he
(defendant) had acted, therefore, with malice - even if We had auth­ority to
review these findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, if his purpose had been to help stop the racket he claims
to be flourishing in the Bureau of Printing - not merely to embarrass, malign
or defame - why did he name only his cousin, complainant herein, not the
"two other employees" who, according to his alleged information, used
to "help" him in said racket?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ap­parently, the defendant did not care, either to ascertain their
names, or to reveal the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short,
he was merely interested in embarrassing <u>his cousin</u> or putting him under
a cloud of suspi­cion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's
purpose was not to forestall the irregularities in the Bureau of Printing, in
general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his own words, his ob­jective
was "to stop the racketeering activities <u>of <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span></u>",
not of the <u>other</u> employees said to be involved in the racket.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under his third assignment of error, defendant insists that he
cannot be punished for writing and sending Exhibit A, because he merely
expressed therein his opinion or belief.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, this assertion is inaccurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true he expressed in Exhibit A the
"opinion or belief" that there was a "flourishing racket"
in the Bur­eau of Printing and that this had been "going on for two years
al­ready." The defendant, however, went <u>farther</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <u>denounced</u> in Exhibit A that
complainant was the person engaged in such racket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant urged that "action on this
matter be taken accordingly", and even asked that he be "informed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> before investigation be
initiated" in order that he could furnish "additional information re­garding
this case." In short, defendant conveyed the impression that he had
evidence to substantiate the charges made in Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, again, in order to escape criminal responsibility for libel
or slander, it is not enough for the party who writes a defama­tory
communication to another to say that he (the writer) expresses therein no more
than his opinion or belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
communication must be made in the performance of a "legal, moral, or
social duty." Defendant had no such "legal, moral, or social
duty" to convey his <u>opinion</u> or <u>belief</u> about complainant's
moral fiber, to the Director of Printing or the Secretary of General
Services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's civic duty was to help
the Government clean house and weed out dishonest, unfit or disloyal officers
and employees thereof, <u>when there is rea­sonable ground to believe</u> that
they fall under this category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no
legal right, much less duty, to <u>gossip</u>, or <u>foster the circulation of
rumors</u>, or jump at conclusions, and more so if they are gratui­tous or
groundless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the freedom of
speech, which is guaranteed with a view to strengthening our democratic
institutions and promoting the general welfare, would be a convenient excuse to
engage in the vituperation of individuals, for the attainment of private,
selfish and vindictive ends, thereby hampering the operation of the Government
with administrative investigations of charges preferred without any color or
appearance of truth, and with no other probable effect than the <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span> of the officer or employee concerned, to the
detriment of public service and public order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the evidence on record does <u>not</u>
satisfactorily show that the defendant <u>really</u> entertained the
"opinion or belief" he claimed to have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the information on which
Exhibit A was allegedly based had been given to him as early as February, 1961,
according to his testimony, and that the civil action against his wife and her
uncle was filed by complainant's mother in March, 1961, it is only logical to
believe that, before writing Exhibit A on May 5, 1961, he must have made
further inquiries and sought, with greater earnestness, evidence to support the
charges therein set forth, and that he found no such evidence, because,
otherwise, he would have introduced the same in the administrative
investigation against complainant herein or, at least, in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worse still, he did not introduce in the present case some of the
evidence presented by him at the administrative investigation above referred
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This omission is understandable,
however, when we consider that said evidence tended to show that the defen­dant
did not receive from <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span>
the information he (defendant) claims to have obtained from the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, pursuant to defendant's testimony in
the case at bar and Exhibit A, he had been informed by <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span>
that, for about two (2) years, complainant, "with the help of two other
employees" of the Bureau of Printing, had been printing therein, at night,
"using the properties and facilities" thereof, "wedding
invitation cards" and "term papers for college students and
others." The report on said administrative investiga­tion (Exhibit F)
shows that <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> had merely testified that, on
January 20, 1961, he paid a given sum to his neighbor, complainant Jesus <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span>, for 45 wedding invitations, which - according
to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span> and Felipe Campo in
said investi­gation - were printed at <span class="SpellE">Imprenta</span> Angeles
- of which Campo is an employee - at No. 929-A McGregor, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>,
Manila, and for which <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span> had paid P20, on
January 16, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant's own testimony, in said investigation, was to the
effect that, on February 8, 1961, he paid <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span>
P3,00 for a lead mold for calling cards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant's other witnesses, in that investigation, were Antonio <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Regala</span>, Acting
Chiefs, respectively of the Job and Tabular Section and the Com­posing
Division, of the Bureau of Printing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both, in effect, affirmed that <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span> did
<u>not</u> and could <u>not</u> have committed, in said office, the
irregularities imputed to him by the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, defen­dant's evidence in said administrative investigation showed
that no­body had given him the information mentioned in Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> did not
tell him that the wedding invitations had been printed by com­plainant in the
Bureau of Printing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither had any
other person advised the defendant that the aforementioned lead mold for
calling cards had been made in that Office, much less with materials and
equipment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the
defendant had not come across any evidence or received any information about
the printing, in said office, of "Christmas cards" or "term
papers of college students or others".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seemingly, defendant's manifest bias and animosity to­wards <span class="SpellE">Ballesteros</span> had merely led him (defendant) to surmise and

<blockquote>"The person must <u>honestly</u> believe in the truth of the
charge he makes at the time he makes it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this implies that <u>he must have some ground</u> for the as­sertion;
it need not be a conclusive or convincing ground; but <u>no charge should ever
be made recklessly and wantonly, even in confidence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inquirer should be put in possession of
all known means of knowledge; if the only means of knowledge is hearsay, he
should be told so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A rumor should
never be stated as a fact;</u> and <u>in repeating a rumor care should be taken
not to heighten its color or exaggerate its extent</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the only information possessed is
contained in a letter, he should be given the letter and left to draw his own
con­clusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A person should not
speak the air of knowing of his own knowledge that every word is a fact when he
is merely repeating gossip or hazarding a series of reckless assertions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If time allows, and means of inquiry exist,
he should make some attempt to sift the charge before spreading it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, con­fidential advice should be
given seriously and conscientiously; it should be <u>manifest</u> that the
person <u>does not take a pleasure in maligning the party</u> but is <u>compelled</u>
to do so in the <u>honest</u> discharge of a <u>painful</u> duty."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar differs substantially from <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <st1:place><st1:city>Bustos</st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> <st1:country-region>U. S.</st1:country-region></st1:place>
v. Cañete<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Deaño</span> v. Godinez.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a> The first involved charges filed
by persons who were <u>found</u> to have acted in the belief, <u>in good faith</u>,
that their imputations <u>were true, there being "(p)<span class="SpellE">robable</span>
cause</u> for them to think" so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They "did not eagerly seize on a frivo­lous matter" but had <u>affidavits</u>
in support of their charges, "which were <u>sufficient in an investigation
(conducted) by a judge of first instance to convince him in their seriousness</u>."
The second case re­ferred to fifty (50) persons who, after a meeting held for
the pur­pose, had decided - based upon <u>the belief generally prevailing in
the community</u>, and acting <u>without actual malice</u>, as well as <u>with
manifest good faith</u> - to prefer, with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Manila, certain charges against the local parish priest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third case dealt with an <u>official</u>
communication sent by a public school district supervisor to his immediate
superior, the Division Superin­tendent of Schools, concerning the actuations of
a school dentist in relation to a number of public school teachers, all of whom
were under the jurisdiction of the first two.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charges made in the first case were predicated upon af­fidavits,
which were screened by "reputable attorneys", through whom the
charges were filed to the proper official.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, no such affidavits were ever made and the defendant
does not claim to have sought the advice of counsel before sending Exhibit A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, one of the issues in this case
is whether or not defendant had really received the information mentioned in
Exhibit A, and neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals has believed
his testimony to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither do
We.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, too, in the present case,
there is proof of a litigation between immediate members of the family of both
parties, which may have created a feeling of enmity between the complainant and
the defendant, whereas, in the cases above-mentioned, there was nothing that
could have so marred the personal relations between the complainant and the
accused, apart from the fact that <u>there was satisfactory proof</u> of the
latter's good faith and <u>absence</u> of malice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth assignment of error is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De­fendant claimed to believe in the truth of
the charges contained in his letter Exhibit A, upon the ground that <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> had al­legedly
informed him about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his duty
to prove that he had been, in fact, so tipped by <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should have known that <span class="SpellE">Holgado's</span>
testimony would have been the best proof thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His failure, not only to introduce said
testimony, but, also, to explain why he did not do so, necessarily weakened his
defense.</p>

<blockquote><u>Inference from not producing Evidence, distinguished</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle has been already examined that
a party's failure to produce evidence which, if favorable, would naturally have
been produced, is open to the inference that the facts were unfavorable to his
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Wigmore</span>
on Evi­dence. Vol. VIII. p. 426.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The failure to produce evidence, in general, other than his own
testimony, is open to inference <u>against</u> a party accused, with the same
limitations applicable to civil parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> .</blockquote>

<blockquote>Here, however, the effect of the burden of proof has sometimes
tended to confuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the
burden is on the prosecution, and that the accused is not required by any rule
of law to pro­duce evidence; but nevertheless <u>he runs the risk of an
inference from non-production</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
seem­ing paradox, which has been already sufficiently noticed in treating of
the general principle, has <u>misled</u> a few Courts to deny that any
inference may be drawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Wigmore</span> on Evidence, Vol. VIII, pp. 427, 431.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the last assignment of error, defendant assails the
decision appealed from, upon the ground that he should not be held accountable
for the fact that Exhibit A was read by the Adminis­trative Officer of the
Bureau of Printing, who, apparently, opens letters addressed to the Director of
Printing, and, also, by his secretary, Mario <span class="SpellE">Banzuela</span>
to whom the Director had referred it, as well as by those who participated in
the aforementioned investi­gation, inasmuch as said communication was addressed
to no other than the Director of Printing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted, however, that defendant had, likewise, sent a copy
of Exhibit A to the Secretary of General Services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, considering that the former had
explicitly asked an investigation of the charges preferred in said
communication, it is obvious that the reading of Exhibit A by other persons
than its aforementioned addressee was precisely what the defendant had
envisaged and sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even, however, if
no other person than the Director of Printing, to whom Exhibit A was ad­dressed,
had read it, still such fact is sufficient publication there­of, for purposes
of libel, for he is a third person as regards its writer and the person defamed
therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>
Indeed, "(a) libel is 'published' not only when it is widely circulated,
but also when it is made known or brought to the attention or notice of another
person" than its author and the offended party.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a></p>
