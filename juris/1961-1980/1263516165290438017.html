				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission, through its Chairman, Mrs.
N. <span class="SpellE">Baens</span> del. Rosario, turned down the<span style=""> claim of </span>herein petitioner for
compensation benefits by reason of the death of her husband, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Layag</span>, while an employee in the Bureau of Public
Works.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent faces are stated in the decision appealed from, <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that Alberto <span class="SpellE">Layag</span>
worked as chief-cook since 1948 in the tugboat M/V Chester of the respondent's
Bureau of Public Works after a pre-employment, physical examination performed
on him which qualified him for job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
chief-cook, he was assisted by <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span><span style=""> Tomas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He </span>received P6.50 daily were working from 5:00 <span class="SpellE">a.m</span>, to 7:00 p.m.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His duties con listed of marketing, cooking food for the crew members,
setting the table for them, washing the dishes and utensils used in <span style="">the </span>preparation of food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On certain occasions it was alleged that he
helped in cleaning the deck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some­time
in 1949 he was allegedly hospitalized at the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Hospital and in 1955 he contracted influenza
and spat <span style="">blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 23</span><span style="">,</span><span style=""> 1960 he was con</span><span style="">fined at the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
Hospital </span>due to <span style="">fever, body
weakness, and brown spots on the skin diagnosed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">his attending </span><span style="">physician Dr. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Calilong</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">as hemorrhagic
fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From February 8, 1960 to March 2,
1960 he was admitted at the North General Hospital for <span class="SpellE">hypoplastic</span>
anemia and <span class="SpellE">ascariasis</span>, re-admitted at the North
General Hospital for the same illness and he died on March 29, 1960 of <span class="SpellE">thrombocytopanic</span> <span class="SpellE">purpura</span> with
cerebral hemorrhage and <span class="SpellE">hypoplastic</span> anemia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His widow, claimant herein, filed a death
benefit claim for </span><span style="">herself and in
behalf of all her minor children </span>with the deceased Alberto <span class="SpellE">Layag</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue posed by the
parties is whether or not the cause of death was service connected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In returning </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">negative conclusion the Commission found that aside from his duties </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">chief-cook and the usual chores incidental
thereto, such </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">marketing, preparing
and setting the table and serving during </span><span style="">meals, </span><span style="">the deceased performance no other work, let alone scrubbing the floor,
cleaning and painting the boat, as petitioner alleges; and that the record of
his illness does not reveal any causal relation with his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concerning the particular ailment of which he
died to Commission took into account the research and study made its senior
medical officer, reproduced in the decision as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Thrombocytopanic</span> <span class="SpellE">purpura</span>
is a disorder of the blood characterized by reduction of blood platelets, which
may be primary or secondary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Primary <span class="SpellE">thrombocytopanic</span> <span class="SpellE">purpura</span> - the hemorrhagic disorder is due to reduction in
blood platelets which has not been traced to any demonstrable un­derlying cause
and usually cured by <span class="SpellE">aplenectromy</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Secondary <span class="SpellE">thrombocytopanic</span> <span class="SpellE">purpura</span> - condition in which the reduction of platelets
occur due to involvement of the bone marrow by infiltration of foreign <span style="">cells like cancer or <span class="SpellE">carcomas</span>
<span class="SpellE">cellea</span> or some other toxic substances like alcohol,
etc.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The cerebral hemorrhage and <span class="SpellE">hypoplastic</span>
anemia in this particular case may be due to defective bleeding and clotting
time which is part of the illness, <span class="SpellE">thrombocytopanic</span> <span class="SpellE">purpura</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now says the foregoing medical study <span style="">is not competent evidence </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this case because it was not formally offered and receive with notice
to the claimant, </span>and that if <span style="">such
evidence is disregarded the presumption established in Section 43 of </span>the
<span style="">Workmen's Compensation </span>Act <span style="">must prevail, namely, that "in </span><span style="">any </span><span style="">proceeding for the en­forcement of the claim for compensation under
this Act, it shall be presumed in the absence of substantial evidence </span>to
<span style="">the contrary - (1) that the claim comes
within the provisions of this Act."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The cause of death here is
not disputed: <span class="SpellE">thrombocyto<span style="">panic</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">purpura</span> with cerebral hemorrhage and <span class="SpellE">hypoplastic</span>
</span>anemia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">All that the Commission did was to go into the clinical </span>causes <span style="">of the disease </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">revealed by </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">studies made by its </span>own <span style="">medical
officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This the Commission could do to
properly inform itself on the technical questions involved, pursuant to one of
its Rules (Sec. 9), which provides that "in </span>the <span style="">hearing, investigation and determination of
any question </span>or <span style="">controversy and
in the exercise of any duties or powers, </span>the <span style="">Hearing Officer or Commissioner shall act according to </span>justice <span style="">and equity and the substantial merits of the
case, <u>without regard to technicalities or legal</u></span><u><span style=""> forms,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">and shall not be bound</span>
</u><u><span style="">by any technical rule of </span>legal
evidence but may inform himself </u><u><span style="">of
their merit in such manner as to attain objectives of law</span></u><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The illness of which the
deceased Alberto <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> died shows that it was foreign
to the nature of his work, and since</span> <span style="">this </span><span style="">fact </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">supported by substantial evidence, the </span>presumption <span style="">in Section 43 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act </span>does not operate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from is affirmed, without cost.</p>
