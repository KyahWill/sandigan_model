"Don Emilio Cariño Agustin" (Cariño) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b> </p><p> This case stemmed from two (2) Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> filed before the RTC accusing Cariño of the crimes of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs. The prosecution alleged that on April 24, 2012, policemen of the Special Operations Group of the Negros Oriental Police Provincial Office successfully conducted a buy-bust operation against a certain "Dondon," later identified as Cariño, during which one (1) plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance was recovered from him. When Cariño was searched incidental to his arrest, the policemen recovered another plastic sachet containing the same aforesaid substance from him. While waiting for the arrival of the witnesses – namely, Barangay Kagawad Chona Merced (Kagawad Merced), Department of Justice (DOJ) Representative Ramonito Astillero (DOJ Representative Astillero and Media Representative Juancho Gallarde (Media Representative Gallarde) policemen then conducted the marking and inventory at the place of arrest in Cariño's presence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Upon the witnesses' arrival thereat, the policemen presented the Inventory/Receipt of Property Seized<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to them and they signed the same. Thereafter, Cariño and the seized items were taken to the police headquarters where the necessary paperworks for examination were prepared. The seized items were then brought to the crime laboratory where, after examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the contents thereof yielded positive for 0.09 and 0.04 gram, respectively, of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <em>shabu</em>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> In defense, Cariño denied the charges against him, claiming instead, that he was a former asset of the policemen who arrested him, and that they framed him up after he begged to be excused from a surveillance task assigned to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated February 25, 2014, the RTC found Cariño guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged, and accordingly, sentenced him as follows: (<em>a</em>) in Criminal Case No. 21107, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00; and (<em>b</em>) in Criminal Case No. 21108, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of twelve (12) years, and one (1) day, as minimum, to twelve (12) years, ten (10) months, and one (1) day, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The RTC found that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that Cariño was arrested after he was caught<em> in flagrante delicto</em> to be selling <em>shabu</em>, and that after his arrest, another sachet containing<i> shabu</i> was recovered from him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Cariño moved for reconsideration but the same was denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated March 20, 2014.

It held that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crimes charged against Cariño, and that the conduct of inventory <i>prior</i> to the arrival of the witnesses, among others, did not tarnish the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> Hence, this appeal seeking that Cariño's conviction be overturned. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The appeal is meritorious. </p><p> In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti </i>of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In this regard, case law recognizes that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<em>a</em>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, "a representative from the media <b><i><u>and</u></i></b> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> or (<em>b</em>) if after the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, "[a]n elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <b><i><u>or</u></i></b> the media."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <em>ipso facto</em> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<em>a</em>) there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (<em>b</em>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Anent the witness requirement, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time – beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest – to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p>Notably, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings<i> a quo</i>; otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> In this case, it would initially appear that the apprehending policemen complied with the witness requirement, considering that the Inventory/Receipt of Property Seized<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> contains the signatures of the required witnesses, <i>i.e</i>., Kagawad Merced, DOJ Representative Astillero, and Media Representative Gallarde. However, a more circumspect examination of the records would show that these witnesses arrived <b><i><u>after</u></i></b> the apprehending policemen had already completed the inventory, and that they were merely asked to sign the aforesaid inventory form. The respective testimonies of the aforesaid witnesses are revelatory, to wit:</p><p align="center"> <b>Testimony of Kagawad Merced</b> </p><blockquote> <p> [Pros. Zerna]: And when you arrived at that place where the arrest was made, what was it that you were able to observe? <br> [Kagawad Merced]: When I arrived there, the suspected items were already there. </p> <p>Q: Where did you particularly see these items that you said were suspected to have been confiscated? <br> A: When I arrived there, it was already placed on the table[.] </p> <p>Q: And what did you do when you arrive (sic) there?<br> A: Somebody told me that these are the items that were recovered and I inspected the items and compared it with what was listed and I signed it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>Testimony of DOJ Representative Astillero</b> </p><blockquote> <p> [Atty. Cariño]: You mean to say that when you arrived at that time the inventory sheet was already prepared? <br> [DOJ representative Astillero]: Yes, sir. </p> <p> Q: Was it already signed by somebody else?<br> A: When I signed it there were other signatures. </p> <p>x x x x </p> <p>Q: You already testified that you have not witnessed the time on the fact of the confiscation of these items? <br> A: No more, when I arrived there, there was already an inventory on the confiscated items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p> <p align="center"> <b>Testimony of Media Representative Gallarde</b></p> <p> [Atty. Cariño]: How would you considered (<i>sic</i>) then that there was indeed or it was true the (sic) conduct of an inventory? <br> [Media Representative Gallarde]: My purpose is to observe and witness the inventory I don't have personal knowledge how (<i>sic</i>) the alleged buy bust and alleged confiscation of the items. </p> <p>Q: And you also do not have any personal knowledge of the conduct of the inventory? <br> A: Yes, sir. </p> <p>Q: You only have actual knowledge as to the fact that when you arrived at the place [of the arrest] you signed the inventory sheet? <br> A: Yes, sir. </p> <p> Q: And when you arrived you also noticed that the inventory sheet was already signed by the two (2) Kagawads which you already mentioned[?]<br> A: Yes, sir. </p> <p> Q: And it was already signed by a certain Astillero? <br> A: Yes, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> As may be gleaned from the testimonies of the required witnesses themselves, the inventory was <b><i><u>not</u></i></b> conducted in their presence as the apprehending policemen already prepared the Inventory/Receipt of Property Seized when they arrived at the scene of arrest and only made them sign the same. As discussed, the witness requirement mandates the presence of the witnesses <b><i><u>during</u></i></b> the conduct of the inventory, so as to ensure that the evils of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence will be adequately prevented. Hence, non-compliance therewith puts the onus on the prosecution to provide a justifiable reason therefor, especially considering that the rule exists to ensure that protection is given to those whose life and liberty are put at risk.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Unfortunately, no such explanation was proferred by the prosecution to justify this glaring procedural lapse. In view of this unjustified deviation from the chain of custody rule, the Court is therefore constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Cariño were compromised, which consequently warrants his acquittal.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
