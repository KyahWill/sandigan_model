The accusatory portion of the Second Amended Information states that:<br><blockquote>The undersigned State Prosecutors hereby accuse EXCEL GURRO y MAGA @ EXCEL, JOEL JAMINDANG y ZOSA @ JOJO, WENNIE IDIAN y JAMINDANG @ WINNIE, and JOHN DOE/S, of the crime of KIDNAPPING WITH HOMICIDE, defined and penalized under Article 267 of the [R]evised Penal Code committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about August 2, 2008, at Malanday, Marikina City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating, and mutually helping one another, together with other persons whose names and identities are unknown, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnapped and detained victim, AAA, AN 8-YEAR- OLD MINOR, AGAINST HER WILL, FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXTORTING RANSOM FROM THE VICTIM AND THE LATTER'S FAMILY AND THEREAFTER, DEMANDED THE AMOUNT OF Three Million (Php 3,000,000.00) Pesos, and actually received the amount of One Hundred Eighty-Six Thousand (Php186,000.00) pesos ransom money in exchange for AAA's life and liberty. <u>While in captivity victim AAA was murdered by the accused while in detention.</u><br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>Joel pleaded guilty to the charge of kidnapping with homicide, while Excel and Wennie pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.<br><br>The antecedent facts reveal that on August 2, 2008, Arnel Salvador (Arnel) brought his daughter AAA to the house of Wennie. Wennie is the wife of Randy, the brother of Arnel's wife, Helen Salvador (Helen).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witness Patrick Mabulac (Patrick) confirmed that he saw AAA at Wennie's house playing with the latter's daughters, at around 2:00 p.m. of August 2, 2008. Later on, he saw Wennie leave with AAA. Wennie returned alone at 3:00 p.m.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>AAA went missing thereafter.<br><br>At around 5:00p.m. of even date, Bernard, Helen's brother received a text message from an unknown person saying, "hawak namin ang anak ninyo.

When the group had left, Wennie asked Patrick to help her look for AAA. Since Wennie's cellphone battery was running low, she borrowed Patrick's cellphone and inserted her SIM card therein. She then texted someone. After removing her SIM Card from Patrick's phone, Wennie apologized to him, claiming that she accidentally deleted all of the messages in his cellphone. Later that night, Wennie again borrowed Patrick's cellphone and deleted all of the latter's contacts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The next day, Patrick was about to send Joel a text quote, when he suddenly noticed that Joel's number had been deleted from his contact list. Patrick commented to Wennie that she had deleted Joel's number, to which Wennie casually replied that she may have erased it by accident as she was not accustomed to using Patrick's cellphone. Then, Patrick asked Wennie for Joel's number, but the latter dismissively said that Joel no longer has a cellphone. Patrick asked for Joel's number from the house helper. Later on, Patrick showed the Salvador family Joel's cellphone number and they noticed that Joel's number matched that of the kidnapper's.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>At around 8:00 p.m., Arnel's family received another text message from the kidnappers asking if the money was already available. The kidnappers ordered Arnel to come up with the money, otherwise, they would kill AAA. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The next morning, Arnel sent a message to the kidnappers and informed them that he only had P186,000.00. The kidnappers instructed him to bring the money to 7-Eleven at Bayan, Marikina City. Upon reaching 7-Eleven, Arnel received another message ordering him to go to Metrobank instead and deposit the money in the account of one Jackielou Guevarra (Jackielou).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Randy accompanied Arnel at Metrobank. While depositing the money, Arnel was informed that the amount he deposited was being wired to Catbalogan City. Hearing this, Randy commented that Jojo (Joel) might be involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>At around 5:00 p.m., Arnel again received a text message from the kidnappers saying that AAA will be dropped off in Cubao, Quezon City. However, AAA was never released. Arnel and his family learned that AAA had been killed on August 3, 2008. They were instructed to go to a funeral parlor in Laguna to identify her body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On August 5, 2008, Wennie suddenly left for Catbalogan, Samar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>During the trial, prosecution witness Jackielou testified that at around 12 noon of August 4, 2008, Excel suddenly approached her while she was standing in line at the Automated Teller Machine in Metrobank Catbalogan, Samar. She had known Excel since high school. Excel asked if he could borrow her account number so that his cousin Joel could deposit P20,000.00 in her account for his tuition fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[</sup><font color="#FF0000"><sup>19</sup></font><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">]</sup><br><br>Later on, Jackielou received a text message from Excel informing her that P186,000.00 had been deposited to her account. She withdrew the money and handed it to Excel, who placed it inside a yellow plastic bag.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The accused vehemently denied the charges leveled against them. Wennie and Joel related that they are siblings, while Excel is their cousin. Joel admitted that he kidnapped AAA and, thereafter, killed her because he got irritated with her, as she kept insisting to go home.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Joel stated that Wennie had nothing to do with the crime, and that he merely used Excel to receive the ransom money. He related that he told Excel to look for somebody with a Metrobank account because Joel's father will be sending a large sum of money to Excel. After withdrawing the money, Excel remitted P183,000.00 to Joel through ML Kwarta Padala. Thereafter, he and hisÂ· cohorts went to Naga City and divided the ransom.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Likewise, Joel claimed that Patrick was the mastermind of the plot to kidnap AAA. He related that he sent P30,000.00 to Patrick from the ransom money he received from the Salvador family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Wennie also denied the charges leveled against her. Wennie admitted that Arnel left AAA. in her care. She claimed that she brought the victim to her friend's house and they went home after 15 minutes. Then, AAA left for home at around 2:00 p.m.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br><br>On December 5, 2012, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> conv1ctmg Wennie and Joel, as principals and Excel, as an accomplice for the crime of Kidnapping with Homicide.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the court finds accused [JOEL] and [WENNIE], GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of KIDNAPPING WITH HOMICIDE.

The CA found that Joel and Wennie conspired to kidnap AAA. Also, the CA held that Excel was an accomplice of Joel and Wennie. According to the CA, Excel's act of borrowing the Metrobank account of his friend, thereby allowing him to receive the ransom was proof that he assisted in thecrime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As for the damages awarded, the CA increased the amount of civil indemnity awarded by the RTC to P100,000.00. The CA, likewise, awarded moral damages of P100,000.00 and exemplary damages of P100,000.00. Finally, the CA apportioned the award of damages by adjudging Joel and Wennie liable to shoulder the greater share of the damages in the amount of 5/6, while holding Excel liable for merely 1/6 of the total amount of damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the assailed CA decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeals are DENIED.

Particularly, Wennie argues that the circumstance that she was last seen with AAA is not by itself sufficient to prove her complicity to the crime. Likewise, she urges the Court to give credence to Joel's statement that she (Wennie) was not involved in kidnapping AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, Excel asserts in his Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> that both the trial court and the CA erred in convicting him as an accomplice to the crime. He contends that he did not assist Joel in profiting from the effects of the crime. He was not aware of the kidnapping and had no idea that the amount deposited in the account of Jackielou partook of ransom money.<br><br>On the other hand, the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the 'Solicitor General (OSG), counters that the prosecution sufficiently established the guilt of both Wennie and Excel. The OSG avers that the evidence shows that Wennie conspired with Joel to kidnap AAA. She was the last person seen with AAA, and her acts subsequent to the kidnapping were certainly dubious. In fact, prosecution witnesses Arnel and Patrick confirmed that AAA was last seen with Wennie. As a conspirator, Wennie was equally responsible for all the acts committed by Joel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Likewise, Excel actively cooperated with Joel and Wennie in the crime of kidnapping, by acting as the medium through which Joel received the ransom money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><br><b><i>The Court affirms the conviction of Wennie and Excel.<br><br>The Prosecution Established Beyond<br>Reasonable Doubt the Guilt of<br>Wennie as a Principal to the Crime<br>of Kidnapping for Ransom with<br>Homicide</i></b><br><br>Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[38]</sup></font> defines and penalizes the crime of kidnapping, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>Article 267</b>. <i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention</i>. - Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death:<br><br>1.

If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained; or if threats to kill him shall have been made.<br><br>4. If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, except when the accused is any of the parents, female or a public officer.<br><br>The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.<br><br>When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>In the cases of <i>People v. Dionaldo, et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and <i>People v. Elizalde, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court explained that if the victim was detained for the purpose of extorting ransom and the victim dies during detention, then the crime committed shall be the special complex crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide. This holds true in the case at bar, considering that all the elements for the said crime were sufficiently alleged in the Information, in that: (i) the victim was detained against her will; (ii) the accused demanded ransom from the victim's family; and (iii) the victim was killed during detention. Thus, the proper nomenclature for the offense committed shall be kidnapping for ransom with homicide, and not simply kidnapping for homicide, as the prosecution charged.<br><br>More importantly, the prosecution was able to prove each of the component offenses of kidnapping for ransom with homicide. AAA was a minor, who was taken on August 2, 2008 and was, thereafter, detained or deprived of her liberty, in exchange for ransom. Later on, AAA was killed while in detention.<br><br>Joel pleaded guilty to the crime but denied conspiring with his sister Wennie. In the same regard, Wennie urges that the prosecution failed to prove the alleged conspiracy between her and Joel.<br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>It cannot be gainsaid that conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Once conspiracy is established, the responsibility of the conspirators is collective, thereby rendering them all equally liable regardless of the extent of their respective participations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This means that each conspirator is responsible for everything done by his/her confederates which follows incidentally in the execution of a common design as one of its probable and natural consequences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Simply stated, their responsibility is not confined to the accomplishment of the particular purpose of conspiracy, but extends to collateral acts and offenses incident to and growing out of their intended purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In the same vein, the conspirators are deemed to have intended the consequences of their acts and by purposely engaging in conspiracy which necessarily and directly produces a prohibited result, they are, in contemplation of law, chargeable with intending that result.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Equally important, direct proof is not necessary to establish the fact of conspiracy. Rather, conspiracy may be presumed from, and proven by the acts of, the accused pointing to a joint purpose, design, concerted action and community of interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution presented credible and sufficient pieces of circumstantial evidence which, when taken together, prove that Wennie conspired with Joel, to wit:<br><blockquote>(i) At around 1:00 p.m. of August 2, 2008, AAA was brought by her father to Wennie's house;<br><br>(ii) An hour thereafter, Wennie, together with AAA, left the house on board the former's tricycle;<br><br>(iii) At 3:00 p.m., Wennie came home alone;<br><br>(iv) AAA was never seen again;<br><br>(v) Wennie started acting suspiciously after AAA's disappearance;<br><br>(vi) On the night that AAA's family went looking for her, Wennie kept secretly texting an unknown person using Patrick's cellphone;<br><br>(vii) Wennie admitted having deleted the cellphone number of Joel from Patrick's cellphone;<br><br>(viii) Wennie kept misleading Patrick as to Joel's correct cellphone number and deliberately gave him the wrong cellphone number; and<br><br>(ix) Joel's cellphone number was found to be the same as that of the kidnapper's.</blockquote>It is all too apparent that Wennie's susp1cwus acts show her complicity to the crime. To begin with, she was the last person seen with AAA. She and AAA went outside of the house, but the former returned home alone. AAA went missing thereafter.<br><br>Likewise, Wennie's staunch efforts at protecting Joel were indeed questionable. It was certainly suspicious why Wennie constantly misled Patrick as to Joel's true cellphone number. First, she deleted all of the messages in Particle's cellphone after using the same, and then she deleted all of Patrick's contacts. Not content, Wennie even misled Patrick, by deliberately giving a wrong number. All of these suspicious deeds cast doubt unto Wennie's innocence, especially since it was later on discovered that Joel's cellphone number matched that of the kidnapper's.<br><br>In addition, it was highly suspicious why Wennie suddenly went home to Catbalogan City - the town where the money was wired. Also, it was discovered that Wennie was heavily indebted and had pawned pieces of jewelry belonging to her husband Randy without this knowledge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Certainly, the acts of Wennie, when taken together, reveal that she acted in concert with Joel and that their acts emanated from the same purpose or common design showing unity in its execution. For sure, Joel would not have been able to kidnap AAA if not for the participation of Wennie.<br><br>Against this factual backdrop, all that Wennie offers as proof of her innocence is the weak defense of denial. This defense cannot prevail, as it is settled that "alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. They are considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable but also because they are easily fabricated and concocted."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> A denial cannot prevail over the positive testimony of prosecution witnesses who were not shown to have any ill-motive to falsely testify against the appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b><i>Excel is Guilty as an Accessory to<br>the Crime of Kidnapping for<br>Ransom with Homicide</i></b><br><br>The RPC delineates the liabilities of each of the offenders by determining the extent of their respective participations in the offense committed.<br><br>Relatedly, principals are those who either (i) "take a direct part in the execution of the act;"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (ii) "directly force or induce others to commit it;"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (iii) "or cooperate in the commission of the offense by another act without which it would not have been accomplished."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> While accomplices are those persons who, not having acted as principals, cooperate in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, accessories to the crime are described in Article 19 as:<br><blockquote>[T]hose who, having knowledge of the commission of the crime, and without having participated therein, either as principals or accomplices, take part subsequent to its commission in any of the following manners:<br><br>1.

It must be remembered that for one to be regarded as an accomplice, it must be shown that (i) he knew the criminal design of the principal by direct participation, and concurred with the latter in his purpose; (ii) he cooperated in the execution by previous or simultaneous acts, with the intention of supplying material or moral aid in the execution of the crime in an efficacious way; and (iii) his acts bore a direct relation with the acts done by the principal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>There was no showing that Excel actually cooperated or assisted in kidnapping AAA and detaining the latter. At best, Excel's participation in the incident was limited to acts committed <b>after</b> the abduction was already consummated. Particularly, Excel retrieved the ransom money from Metrobank and, thereafter, immediately forwarded the same to Joel, through four money transfer transactions through ML Kwarta Padala remittance on August 4, 2008, merely two hours after Arnel wired the ransom money to the kidnappers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This was established through the documents presented by Atty. Heidi Caguioa (Atty. Caguioa), Compliance Officer of ML Kwarta Padala. Atty.

His actuations are certainly suspect. He deceived Jackielou by telling her that his cousin Joel will be depositing P20,000.00 to her account for his tuition fee. However, he later on texted Jackielou that the amount was P183,000.00. He did not express any shock or surprise about suddenly receiving a hefty sum.
