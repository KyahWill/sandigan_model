				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The 1987 Constitution and the Rules of Court promulgated, pursuant to its provisions, granted us original jurisdiction over certain cases. In some instances, this jurisdiction is shared with Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) and the Court of Appeals (CA). However, litigants do not have unfettered discretion to invoke the Court's original jurisdiction. The doctrine of hierarchy of courts dictates that, direct recourse to this Court is allowed only to resolve questions of law, notwithstanding the invocation of paramount or transcendental importance of the action. This doctrine is not mere policy, rather, it is a constitutional filtering mechanism designed to enable the Court to focus on the more fundamental and essential tasks assigned to it by the highest law of the land.<br><br>On December 15, 2014, the Department of Transportation and Communication<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (DOTC) and its attached agency, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), posted an Invitation to Pre-qualify and Bid<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Invitation) on the airport development, operations, and maintenance of the Bacolod-Silay, Davao, Iloilo, Laguindingan, New Bohol (Panglao), and Puerto Princesa Airports (collectively, Projects).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The total cost of the Projects is P116.23 Billion, broken down as follows:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="15%">Bacolod-Silay</td><td width="15%"><div align="left">P20.26 Billion</div></td><td width="74%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Davao</td><td><div align="left">P40.57 Billion</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Iloilo</td><td><div align="left">P30.4 Billion</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Laguindingan</td><td><div align="left">P14.62 Billion</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>New Bohol (Panglao)</td><td><div align="left">P4.57 Billion</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Puetio Princesa</td><td><div align="left"><u>P5.81 Billion</u></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="left">P116.23 Billion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The Invitation stated that the Projects aim to improve services and enhance the airside and landside facilities of the key regional airports through concession agreements with the private sector. The Projects will be awarded through competitive bidding, following the procurement rules and procedure prescibed under Republic Act (RA) No. 6957,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as amended by RA No. 7718<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (BOT Law), and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The concession period would be for 30 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On March 10, 2015, the DOTC and the CAAP issued the Instructions to Prospective Bidders (ITPB),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which provided that prospective bidders are to pre-qualify and bid for the development, operations, and maintenance of the airports, which are now bundled into two groups (collectively, the Bundled Projects), namely:<br><blockquote>Bundle 1: Bacolod-Silay and Iloilo<br>Bundle 2: Davao, Laguindingan, and New Bohol<br>(Panglao)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The costs of Bundle 1 and Bundle 2 are P50.66 Billion and P59.66 Billion, respectively. The Puerto Princesa Airport project was not included in the bundling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The general procedure for the bidding of the Bundled Projects stated that "[p]rospective [b]idders may bid for only Bundle 1 or Bundle 2, or bid for both Bundle 1 and Bundle 2. x x x The [Pre-Qualification, Bids and Awards Commitee (PBAC)] shall announce in a Bid Bulletin prior to the Qualifications Submission Date[,] its policy on whether a [p]rospective [b]idder may be awarded both bundles or whether a [p]rospective [b]idder may only be awarded with one (1) bundle."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The submission of the Pre-Qualification Queries was scheduled for April 3, 2015 and the submission of Qualification Documents on May 18, 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On March 27, 2015, petitioner GIOS-SAMAR, Inc., represented by its Chairperson Gerardo M. Malinao (petitioner), suing as a taxpayer and invoking the transcendental importance of the issue, filed the present petition for prohibition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Petitioner alleges that it is a non-governmental organization composed of subsistence farmers and fisherfolk from Samar, who are among the victims of Typhoon Yolanda relying on government assistance for the rehabilitation of their industry and livelihood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It assails the constitutionality of the bundling of the Projects and seeks to enjoin the DOTC and the CAAP from proceeding with the bidding of the same.<br><br>Petitioner raises the following arguments:<br><br>First, the bundling of the Projects violated the "constitutional prohibitions on the anti-dummy and the grant of opportunity to the general public to invest in public utilities,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> citing Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> According to petitioner, bundling would allow companies with questionable or shaky financial background to have direct access to the Projects "by simply joining a consortium which under the bundling scheme adopted by the DOTC said [P]rojects taken altogether would definitely be beyond the financial capability of any qualified, single Filipino corporation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Second, bundling violates the constitutional prohibition on monopolies under Section 19, Article XII of the Constitution because it would allow one winning bidder to operate and maintain several airpm1s, thus establishing a monopoly. Petitioner asserts that, given the staggering cost of the Bundled Projects, the same can only be undertaken by a group, joint venture outfits, and consortiums which are susceptible to combinations and schemes to control the operation of the service for profit, enabling a single consortium to control as many as six airports.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Third, bundling will "surely perpetrate an undue restraint of trade."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Mid-sized Filipino companies which may have previously considered participating in one of the six (6) distinct Projects will no longer have a realistic opportunity to participate in the bidding because the separate projects became two (2) gargantuan projects. This effectively placed the Projects beyond the reach of medium-sized Filipino companies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Fourth, the PBAC of the DOTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction when it bundled the projects without legal authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Fifth, bundling made a mockery of public bidding because it raised the reasonable bar to a level higher than what it would have been, had the projects been bidded out separately.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In support of petitioner's prayer, for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction, it states that there is extreme urgency to enjoin the bidding of the Bundled Projects so as not to cause irreparable damage and injury to the coffers of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In its comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the DOTC counters that: (1) the petition is premature because there has been no actual bidding yet, hence there is no Justiciable controversy to speak of; (2) petitioner has no legal standing to file the suit whether as a taxpayer or as a private individual; (3) petitioner's allegation on the violation of anti-dummy and equal opportunity clauses of the Constitution are speculative and conjectural; (4) Section 11, Article XII of the Constitution is not applicable to the bidding process assailed by petitioner; (5) the bundling of the Projects does not violate the prohibitions on monopolies or combinations in restraint of trade; and (6) the DOTC and the CAAP did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>For its part, the CAAP asserts that the petition violated the basic fundamental principle of hierarchy of courts. Petitioner had not alleged any special and compelling reason to allow it to seek relief directly from the Court. The case should have been filed with the trial court, because it raises factual issues which need to be threshed out in a full-blown trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The CAAP also maintains that petitioner has neither legal capacity nor authority to file the suit and that the petition has no cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In its reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> petitioner argues that it need not wait for the conduct of the bidding to file the suit because doing so would render useless the very purpose for filing the petition for prohibition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As it is, five groups have already been pre-qualified to bid in the Bundled Projects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Petitioner also submits that direct recourse to this Court is justified as the "matter of prohibiting the bidding process of the x x x illegally bundled projects are matters of public interest and transcendental importance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It further insists that it has legal standing to file the suit through Malinao, its duly authorized representative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The main issue brought to us for resolution is whether the bundling of the Projects is constitutional.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the bundling of the Projects is unconstitutional because it will: (i) create a monopoly; (ii) allow the creation and operation of a combination in restraint of trade; (iii) violate anti-dummy laws and statutes giving citizens the opportunity to invest in public utilities; and (iv) enable companies with shaky financial backgrounds to participate in the Projects.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>While petitioner asserts that the foregoing arguments involve legal (as opposed to factual) issues, our examination of the petition shows otherwise. As will be demonstrated shortly, petitioner's arguments against the constitutionality of the bundling of the Projects are inextricably intertwined with underlying questions of fact, the determination of which require the reception of evidence. This Court, however, is not a trier of fact. We cannot resolve these factual issues at the first instance. For this reason, we <b>DISMISS</b> the petition.<br><br><center>A<br></center><br>Petitioner claims that the bundling of the Projects violates the constitutional provisions on monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade under Section 19, Article XII of the Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 19. The State shall regulate or prohibit monopolies while the public interest so requires. No combinations in restraint of trade or unfair competition shall be allowed.<br></blockquote>In <i>Tatad v. Secretary of the Department of Energy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we clarified that the Constitution does not prohibit the operation of monopolies <i>per se</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> With particular respect to the operation of public utilities or services, this Court, in <i>Anglo-Fil Trading Corporation v. Lazaro</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> further clarified that "[b]y their very nature, certain public services or public utilities such as those which supply water, electricity, transportation, telephone, telegraph, etc. must be given exclusive franchises if public interest is to be served. Such exclusive franchises are not violative of the law against monopolies."<br><br>In short, we find that the grant of a concession agreement to an entity, as a winning bidder, for the exclusive development, operation, and maintenance of any or all of the Projects, does not <i>by itself</i> create a monopoly violative of the provisions of the Constitution. <i>Anglo-Fil Trading Corporation</i> teaches that exclusivity is inherent in the grant of a concession to a private entity to deliver a public service, where Government chooses not to undertake such service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Otherwise stated, while the grant may result in a monopoly, it is a type of monopoly <i>not violative of law</i>. This is the essence of the policy decision of the Government to enter into concessions with the private sector to build, maintain and operate what would have otherwise been government-operated services, such as airports. In any case, the law itself provides for built-in protections to safeguard the public interest, foremost of which is to require public bidding. Under the BOT Law, for example, a private-public pat1nership (PPP) agreement may be undertaken through public bidding, in cases of solicited proposals, or through "Swiss challenge" (also known as comparative bidding), in cases of unsolicited proposals.<br><br>In any event, the Constitution provides that the State may, by law, prohibit or regulate monopolies <i>when the public interest so requires</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Petitioner has failed to point to any provision in the law, which specifically prohibits the bundling of bids, a detail supplied by the respondent DOTC as implementing agency for the PPP program for airpm1s. Our examination of the petition and the relevant statute, m fact, provides further support for the dismissal of the present action.<br><br>Originally, monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade were governed by, and penalized under, Article 186<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code. This provision has since been repealed by RA No. 10667, or the Philippine Competition Act, which defines and penalizes "all forms of anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant position, and anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>RA No. 10667 does not define what constitutes a "monopoly." Instead, it prohibits one or more entities which has/have acquired or achieved a "dominant position" in a "relevant market" from "abusing" its dominant position. In other words, an entity is not prohibited from, or held liable for prosecution and punishment for, simply securing a dominant position in the relevant market in which it operates. It is only when that entity engages in conduct <i>in abuse</i> of its dominant position that it will be exposed to prosecution and possible punishment.<br><br>Under RA No. 10667, "dominant position" is defined as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. - As used in this Act:<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>(g) <i>Dominant position</i> refers to a position of economic strength that an entity or entities hold which makes it capable of controlling the relevant market independently from any or a combination of the following: competitors, customers, suppliers, or consumers[.]<br></blockquote>"Relevant market," on the other hand, refers to the market in which a particular good or service is sold and which is a combination of the relevant product market and the relevant geographic market.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The determination of a particular relevant market depends on the consideration of factors which affect the substitutability among goods or services constituting such market, and the geographic area delineating the boundaries of the market.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> An entity with a dominant position in a relevant market is deemed to have abused its dominant position if it engages in a conduct that would substantially prevent, restrict, or lessen competition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner has not alleged ultimate facts to support its claim that bundling will create a monopoly, in violation of the Constitution. By merely stating legal conclusions, petitioner did not present any sufficient allegation upon which the Court could grant the relief petitioner prayed for. In <i>Zuñiga­-Santos v. Santos-Gran</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we held that "[a] pleading should state the ultimate facts essential to the rights of action or defense asserted, as distinguished from mere conclusions of fact, or conclusions of law. General allegations that a contract is valid or legal, or is just, fair, and reasonable, are mere conclusions of law. Likewise, allegations that a contract is void, voidable, invalid, illegal, <i>ultra vires</i>, or against public policy, without stating facts showing its invalidity, are mere conclusions of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The present action should thus be dismissed on the ground of failure to state cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Similarly, RA No. 10667 does not define what a "combination in restraint of trade" is. What it does is penalize anti-competitive <i>agreements</i>. Agreement refers to "any type of form or contract, <b>arrangement</b>, understanding, collective recommendation, or concerted action, whether formal or informal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The following agreements are considered anti­ competitive:<br><blockquote>Sec. 14. <i>Anti-Competitive Agreements</i>. -<br><br>(a) The following agreements, between or among competitors, are <i>per se</i> prohibited:<br><br>(1) Restricting competition as to price, or components thereof, or other terms of trade;<br><br>(2) Fixing price at an auction or in any form of bidding including cover bidding, bid suppression, bid rotation and market allocation and other analogous practices of bid manipulation;<br><br>(b) The following agreements, between or among competitors which have the object or effect of substantially preventing, restricting or lessening competition shall be prohibited:<br><br>(1) Setting, limiting, or controlling production, markets, technical development, or investment;<br><br>(2) Dividing or sharing the market, whether by volume of sales or purchases, territory, type of goods or services, buyers or sellers or any other means;<br><br>(c) Agreements other than those specified in (a) and (b) of this section which have the object or effect of substantially preventing, restricting or lessening competition shall also be prohibited: <i>Provided</i>, Those which contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods and services or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits, may not necessarily be deemed a violation of this Act.<br><br>An entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another entity or entities, have common economic interests, and are not otherwise able to decide or act independently of each other, shall not be considered competitors for purposes of this section.<br></blockquote>The bundling of the Projects is an an arrangement made by the DOTC and the CAAP in the conduct of public bidding. The question that arises is whether the same constitutes an anti-competitive agreement prohibited by RA No. 10667. However, to resolve this, we refer to the factors enumerated in Section 26 of RA No. 10667 on the determination of anti-competitive agreements or conduct:<br><blockquote>Sec. 26. <i>Determination of Anti-Competitive Agreement or Conduct</i>. - In determining whether anti-competitive agreement or conduct has been committed, the Commission shall:<br><br>(a) <b>Define the relevant market allegedly affected by the anti-competitive agreement or conduct</b>, following the principles laid out in Section 24 of this Chapter;<br><br><b>(b) Determine if there is actual or potential adverse impact on competition in the relevant market caused by the alleged agreement or conduct, and if such impact is substantial and outweighs the actual or potential efficiency gains that result from the agreement or conduct;</b><br><br>(c) Adopt a broad and forward-looking perspective, recognizing future developments, any overriding need to make the goods or services available to consumers, <b>the requirements of large investments in infrastructure, the requirements of law, and the need of our economy to respond to international competition</b>, but also taking account of past behavior of the parties involved and prevailing market conditions;<br><br>(d) Balance the need to ensure that competition is not prevented or substantially restricted and the risk that competition efficiency, productivity, innovation, or development of priority areas or industries in the general interest of the country may be deterred by overzealous or undue intervention; and<br><br>(e) Assess the totality of evidence on whether it is more likely than not that the entity has engaged in anti-­competitive agreement or conduct including whether the entity's conduct was done with a reasonable commercial purpose such as but not limited to phasing out of a product or closure of a business, or as a reasonable commercial response to the market entry or conduct of a competitor. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Similar to its assertion that bundling will create a monopoly prohibited by law, we find that petitioner, again, utterly failed to sufficiently state a cause of action, by failing to plead ultimate facts to support its conclusion that bundling, as an arrangement, is in restraint of trade or results in unfair competition under the provisions of RA No. 10667.<br><br>Even granting that the petition sufficiently pleads a cause of action for the foregoing violations, there is a need to receive evidence to test the premises of petitioner's conclusions.<br><br>To illustrate, applying the facts and claims relative to the <i>violation of the proscription against monopolies</i>, what RA No. 10667, in fact, prohibits and punishes is the situation where: (1) an entity, having been granted an exclusive franchise to maintain and operate one or more airports, attains a dominant position in that market; and (2) abuses such dominant position by engaging in prohibited conduct, <i>i.e.</i>, acts that substantially prevent, restrict or lessen competition in market of airport development, operations and maintenance. Thus, for petitioner to succeed in asserting that such a prohibited situation legally obtains, it must first establish, <i>by evidence</i>, that indeed: (1) the <i>relevant market</i> is that of airport development, maintenance, and operation (under the facts-based criteria enumerated in Section 24 of RA No. 10667); (2) the entity has achieved a <i>dominant position</i> (under the facts­-based criteria enumerated in Section 27 of RA No. 10667) in that relevant market; and (3) the entity commits acts constituting <i>abuse of dominant position</i> (under the facts based criteria enumerated in Section 27 of RA No. 10667).<br><br>In addition, to support the legal conclusion that bundling is an <i>anti­-competitive agreement</i>, there must be evidence that: (1) the <i>relevant market</i> is that of airport development, maintenance, and operation (under the facts­-based criterion enumerated in Section 24 of RA No. 10667); (2) bundling causes, or will cause, actual or potential adverse impact on the competition in that relevant market; (3) said impact is substantial and outweighs the actual or potential efficiency gains that results from bundling; and (4) the totality of evidence shows that the winning bidder, more likely than not engaged, in anti-competitive conduct.<br><br>The Court, however, is still not a trier of facts. Petitioner should have brought the challenge before a tribunal, specially equipped to resolve the factual and legal issues presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><center>B<br></center><br>We now jointly discuss petitioner's remaining allegations, namely, that bundling of the Projects: (i) violates the anti-dummy law and the constitutional provision allegedly giving citizens the opportunity to invest in public utilities; (ii) is in grave abuse of discretion; and (iii) enables companies with shaky financial backgrounds to participate in the Projects.<br><br>Commonwealth Act No. 108, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Dummy Law, was enacted to limit the enjoyment of certain economic activities to Filipino citizens or corporations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Section 2 of said law states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Simulation of minimum capital stock</i>. - In all cases in which a constitutional or legal provision requires that, in order that a corporation or association may exercise or enjoy a right, franchise or privilege, not less than a certain per centum of its capital must be owned by citizens of the Philippines or of any other specific country, it shall be unlawful to falsely simulate the existence of such minimum stock or capital as owned by such citizens, for the purpose of evading said provision. The president or managers and directors or trustees of corporations or associations convicted of a violation of this section shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than five nor more than fifteen years, and by a fine not less than the value of the right, franchise or privilege, enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions hereof but in no case less than five thousand pesos.<br></blockquote>For liability for violation of Section 2 to attach, it must first be established that there is a law limiting or reserving the enjoyment or exercise of a right, franchise, privilege, or business to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations or associations at least a certain percentage of which is owned by such citizens.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Moreover, it must be shown by <i>evidence</i> that a corporation or association falsely simulated the existence of the minimum required Filipino stock or capital ownership to enjoy or exercise the right, franchise, privilege, or business.<br><br>In this case, petitioner failed to allege ultimate facts showing how the bundling of the Projects violated the Anti-Dummy Law. It did not identify what corporation or association falsely simulated the composition of its stock ownership. Moreover, it did not allege that there is a law limiting, reserving, or requiring that infrastructure or development projects must be awarded only to corporations, a certain percentage of the capital of which is exclusively owned by Filipinos. Executive Order (EO) No. 65,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> even exempts contracts for infrastructure/development projects covered by the BOT Law from the 40% foreign ownership limitation.<br><br>For the same reasons above, petitioner's allegation that bundling violated Section 11,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Article XII of the Constitution - which prescribes a 60% Filipino ownership requirement for franchises, certificate, or for the operation of public utilities - must be rejected.<br><br>Petitioner's argument that, bundling of the Projects gave shady companies direct access to the Projects, also raises questions of fact. Foremost, petitioner does not identify these "shady companies." Even assuming that petitioner is referring to any or all of the five companies who have been pre-qualified to bid in the projects,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> its assertion that these companies are <i>not</i> financially able to undertake the project raises a question of fact, financial ability being a pre-qualification requirement. As already stated earlier, such question is one which this Court is ill-equipped to resolve.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Finally, the allegation that bundling is in grave abuse of discretion is a conclusion of law. As shown, no facts were even alleged to show which specific law was violated by the decision to bundle the Projects.<br><br>In short, these three above arguments of petitioner must be dismissed for failure to. sufficiently plead a cause of action. Even assuming that petitioner's causes of action were properly alleged, the resolution of said issues would still require the determination of factual issues which this Court simply cannot undertake.<br><br>In fine, while this Court has original and concurrent jurisdiction with the RTC and the CA in the issuance of writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (extraordinary writs), direct recourse to this Court is proper only to seek resolution of questions of law. Save for the single specific instance provided by the Constitution under Section 18, Article VII,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> cases the resolution of which depends on the determination of questions of fact cannot be brought directly before the Court because we are not a trier of facts. We are not equipped, either by structure or rule, to receive and evaluate evidence in the first instance; these are the primary functions of the lower courts or regulatory agencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This is the <i>raison d'etre</i> behind the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. It operates as a constitutional filtering mechanism designed to enable this Court to focus on the more fundamental tasks assigned to it by the Constitution. It is a bright­-line rule which cannot be brushed aside by an invocation of the transcendental importance or constitutional dimension of the issue or cause raised.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>For a better understanding of our ruling today, we review below, in light of the Court's fundamental constitutional tasks, the constitutional and statutory evolution of the Court's original and concurrent jurisdiction, and its interplay with related doctrines, pronouncements, and even the Court's own rules, as follows:<br><br>(a) The Court's original and concurrent jurisdiction;<br><br>(b) Direct recourse to the Court under the <i>Angara</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> model; <br><br>(c) The transcendental importance doctrine;<br><br>(d) The Court is not a trier of facts;<br><br>(e) The doctrine of hierarchy of courts;<br><br>(f) The Court's expanded jurisdiction, social rights, and the Court's constitutional rule-making power under the 1987 Constitution;<br><br>(g) Exceptions to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts: The case of <i>The Diocese of Bacolod v.

In dismissing the petition, this Court reminded litigants to refrain from directly filing petitions for extraordinary writs before the Court, unless there were special and important reasons therefor. We then introduced the concept of "hierarchy of courts," to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x This Court's original jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>certiorari</i> (as well as prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus</i> and injunction) is not exclusive. It is shared by this Court with Regional Trial Courts (formerly Courts of First Instance), which may issue the writ, enforceable in any part of their respective regions. It is also shared by this Court, and by the Regional Trial Court, with the Court of Appeals (formerly, Intermediate Appellate Court), although prior to the effectivity of <i>Batas Pambansa Bilang</i> 129 on August 14, 1981, the latter's competence to issue the extraordinary writs was restricted to those "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction." <b>This concurrence of jurisdiction is not, however, to be taken as according to parties seeking any of the writs an absolute, unrestrained freedom of choice of the court to which application therefor will be directed. <u>There is after all a hierarchy of courts.</u> That hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals, and should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for petitions for the extraordinary writs. A becoming regard for that judicial hierarchy most certainly indicates that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level ("inferior") courts should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and those against the latter, with the Court of Appeals. A direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue these writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. This is established policy.</b> x x x<br><br><b>The Court feels the need to reaffirm that policy at this time, and to enjoin strict adherence thereto in the light of what it perceives to be a growing tendency on the part of litigants and lawyers to have their applications for the so-called extraordinary writs, and sometime even their appeals, passed upon and adjudicated directly and immediately by the highest tribunal of the land.</b> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>This doctrine of hierarchy of courts guides litigants as to the proper venue of appeals and/or the appropriate forum for the issuance of extraordinary writs.

This is because the Court, whether in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction, is not equipped to receive and evaluate evidence in the first instance. Our sole role is to apply the law based on the findings of facts brought before us.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> Notably, from the 1901 Rules<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> until the present 1997 Revised Rules of Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> the power to ascertain facts and receive and evaluate evidence in relation thereto is lodged with the trial courts.<br><br>In <i>Alonso v. Cebu Country Club, Inc.</i> (<i>Alonso</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> this Court had occasion to articulate the role of the CA in the judicial hierarchy, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The hierarchy of courts is not to be lightly regarded by litigants. <b>The CA stands between the RTC and the Court, and its establishment has been precisely to take over much of the work that used to be done by the Court. Historically, the CA has been of the greatest help to the Court in synthesizing the facts, issues, and rulings in an orderly and intelligible manner and in identifying errors that ordinarily might escape detection. The Court has thus been freed to better discharge its constitutional duties and perform its most important work</b>, which, in the words of Dean Vicente G. Sinco, "is less concerned with the decision of cases that begin and end with the transient rights and obligations of particular individuals but is more intertwined with the direction of national policies, momentous economic and social problems, the delimitation of governmental authority and its impact upon fundamental rights."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, when litigants seek relief directly from the Court, they bypass the judicial structure and open themselves to the risk of presenting incomplete or disputed facts. This consequently hampers the resolution of controversies before the Court. Without the necessary facts, the Court cannot authoritatively determine the rights and obligations of the parties. The case would then become another addition to the Court's already congested dockets. Thus, as we explained in <i>Alonso</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x Their non-observance of the hierarchy of courts has forthwith enlarged the docket of the Court by one more case, which, though it may not seem burdensome to the layman, is one case too much to the Court, which has to devote time and effort in poring over the papers submitted herein, only to discover in the end that a review should have first been made by the CA. The time and effort could have been dedicated to other cases of importance and impact on the lives and rights of others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Second</i>. Strict adherence to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts also proceeds from considerations of due process. While the term "due process of law" evades exact and concrete definition, this Court, in one of its earliest decisions, referred to it as a law which hears before it condemns which proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial. It means that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property, and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> Under the present Rules of Court, which governs our judicial proceedings, warring factual allegations of parties are settled through presentation of evidence. Evidence is the means of ascertaining, in a judicial proceeding, the truth respecting a matter of fact:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> As earlier demonstrated, the Court cannot accept evidence <i>in the first instance</i>. By directly filing a case before the Court, litigants necessarily deprive themselves of the oportunity to completely pursue or defend their causes of actions. Their right to due process is effectively undermined by their own doing.<br><br>Objective justice also requires the ascertainment of all relevant facts before the Court can rule on the issue brought before it. Our pronouncement in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> is enlightening:<br><blockquote><b>The resolution of controversies is, as everyone knows, the <i>raison d'etre</i> of courts. This essential function is accomplished by first, the ascertainment of all the material and relevant facts from the pleadings and from the evidence adduced by the parties</b>, and <i>second</i>, after that determination of the facts has been completed, by the application of the law thereto to the end that the controversy may be settled authoritatively, definitely and finally.<br><br><b>It is for this reason that a substantial part of the adjective law in this jurisdiction is occupied with assuring that all the facts are indeed presented to the Court; for obviously, to the extent that adjudication is made on the basis of incomplete facts, to that extent there is faultiness in the approximation of objective justice.</b> It is thus the obligation of lawyers no less than of judges to see that this objective is attained; that is to say, that there no suppression, obscuration, misrepresentation or distortion of the facts; and that no party be unaware of any fact material and relevant to the action, or surprised by any factual detail suddenly brought to his attention during the trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><div align="center"><b>I</b><br></div><center><b><br><i>The doctrine of hierarchy of courts as a filtering mechanism</i></b><br></center><br>The doctrine of hierarchy of courts operates to: (1) prevent inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> (2) prevent further over­crowding of the Court's docket;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> and (3) prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intended or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remanded or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedure, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br><br>Strict adherence to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is an effective mechanism to filter the cases which reach the Court. As of December 31, 2016, 6,526 new cases were filed to the Court. Together with the reinstated/revived/reopened cases, the Court has a total of 14,491 cases in its docket. Of the new cases, 300 are raffled to the Court <i>En Banc</i> and 6,226 to the three Divisions of the Court. The Court <i>En Banc</i> disposed of 105 cases by decision or signed resolution, while the Divisions of the Court disposed of a total of 923 by decision or signed resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup><br><br>These, clearly, are staggering numbers. The Constitution provides that the Court has original jurisdiction over five extraordinary writs and by our rule-making power, we created four more writs which can be filed directly before us. There is also the matter of appeals brought to us from the decisions of lower courts. Considering the immense backlog facing the court, this begs the question: <i>What is really the Court's work? What sort of cases deserves the Court's attention and time?</i><br><br>We restate the words of Justice Jose P. Laurel in <i>Angara</i> that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the Constitution. Hence, direct recourse to us should be allowed only when the issue involved is one of law. However, and as former Associate Justice Vicente V. Mendoza reminds, the Court may still choose to avoid passing upon constitutional questions which are confessedly within its jurisdiction if there is some other ground on which its decision may be based.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> The so-called "seven pillars of limitations of judicial review"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> or the "rules of avoidance" enunciated by US Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in his concurring opinion in <i>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> teaches that:<br><blockquote>1. The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary proceeding, declining because to decide such questions "is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act."<br><br>2. The Court will not "anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case."<br><br>3. The Court will not "formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied."<br><br>4. The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question, although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.<br><br>5. The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right of challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. Thus, the challenge by a public official interested only in the performance of his official duty will not be entertained. In <i>Fairchild v. Hughes</i>, the Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit brought by a citizen who sought to have the Nineteenth Amendment declared unconstitutional. In <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon</i>, the challenge of the federal Maternity Act was not entertained although made by the Commonwealth on behalf of all its citizens.<br><br>6. The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.<br><br>7. "When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Meanwhile, in <i>Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> the Court summarized the foregoing "pillars" into six categories and adopted "parallel guidelines" in the exercise of its power of judicial review, to wit:<br><blockquote>The foregoing "pillars" of limitation of judicial review, summarized in <i>Ashwander v.

Jardeleza. To clarify the reasons for my vote, I add the following brief points.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Indeed, the claims made by petitioner GIOS-SAMAR, Inc. require a more contextual appreciation of the evidence that it may present to support its claims. The nature of its various allegations requires the presentation of evidence and inferences, which should, at first instance, be done by a trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Monopolization should not be lightly infened especially since efficient business organizations are rewarded by the market with growth. Due to the high barriers to economic entry and long gestation periods, it is reasonable for the government to bundle infrastructure projects. There is, indeed, a difference between abuse of dominant position in a relevant market<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and combinations in restraint of trade.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Petition seems to have confused these two (2) competition law concepts and it has not made clear which concept it wished to apply.<br><br>Further, broad allegations amounting to a generalization that certain corporations allow themselves to serve as dummies for cartels or foreigners cannot hold ground in this Court. These constitute criminal acts. The Constitution requires that judicial action proceed carefully and always from a presumption of innocence. Tall tales of conspiratorial actions-though they may be salacious, make for interesting fiction, and are fodder for social media-do not deserve any judicial action. Broad generalizations of facts without conesponding evidence border on the contemptuous.<br><br>Although the Constitution grants original and concurrent jurisdiction with the Regional Trial Courts and the Court of Appeals over actions for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, mandamus, <i>quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i>, this Court generally does not receive evidence, and thus, rarely makes findings of facts contested by the patties at first instance. In <i>The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>The doctrine that requires respect for the hierarchy of courts was created by this court to ensure that every level of the judiciary performs its designated roles in an effective and efficient manner. Trial courts do not only determine the facts from the evaluation of the evidence presented before them. They are likewise competent to determine issues of law which may include the validity of an ordinance, statute, or even an executive issuance in relation to the Constitution. To effectively perform these functions, they are territorially organized into regions and then into branches. Their writs generally reach within those territorial boundaries. Necessarily, they mostly perform the all-important task of inferring the facts from the evidence as these are physically presented before them. In many instances, the facts occur within their territorial jurisdiction, which properly present the 'actual case' that makes ripe a determination of the constitutionality of such action. The consequences, of course, would be national in scope. There are, however, some cases where resort to courts at their level would not be practical considering their decisions could still be appealed before the higher courts, such as the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals is primarily designed as an appellate court that reviews the determination of facts and law made by the trial courts. It is collegiate in nature. This nature ensures more standpoints in the review of the actions of the trial court. But the Court of Appeals also has original jurisdiction over most special civil actions. Unlike the trial courts, its writs can have a nationwide scope. It is competent to determine facts and, ideally, should act on constitutional issues that may not necessarily be novel unless there are factual questions to determine.<br><br>This court, on the other hand, leads the judiciary by breaking new ground or further reiterating in the light of new circumstances or in the light of some confusions of bench or bar - existing precedents. Rather than a court of first instance or as a repetition of the actions of the Court of Appeals, this court promulgates these doctrinal devices in order that it truly performs that role.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>This is true whether the remedy used is the original action for certiorari or prohibition, regardless of whether this is brought under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court or the expanded power to examine if there has been grave abuse of discretion by any government branch or instrumentality,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as held in <i>Araullo v. Aquino III</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> among others.<br><br>Through the classic eloquence of the ponente, this case reiterates the doctrine that the finding of grave abuse of discretion made by this Court in its original jurisdiction is generally only over cases where the material facts are not contested. Further, this case highlights that petitioners bear the burden of clearly and convincingly elaborating on why the doctrine of respect for the hierarchy of courts may have been apparently violated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Reiterating these rules is important. A single instance when a ruling is laid means mere <i>ratio decidendi</i>. <i>Ratio decidendi</i>, when repeated in several various compositions of this Court, endows it with the status of an evolving doctrine. When reiterated in a number of cases over the years, an evolving doctrine becomes canon. The <i>ratio decidendi</i>, baring other factors, is strengthened with reiteration and reexamination of its rationale in subsequent cases.<br><br>However, to be more precise, I propose that we clarify that even if the issues raised are questions of law, this Court is not devoid of its discretion to deny addressing the constitutional issues entirely.<br><br>This means restating the difference between the concept of jurisdiction and justiciability in constitutional adjudication.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Jurisdiction is the competence "to hear, try[,] and decide a case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It is a power that is granted by the Constitution and by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In situations where several courts may exercise jurisdiction either originally or on an appeal, the court that first seized of the issues holds jurisdiction over the case, to the exclusion of the rest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Jurisdiction, or the competence to proceed with the case, requires several elements. To determine jurisdiction, courts assess: (1) the remedy or the procedural vehicle for raising the issues;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (2) the subject matter of the controversy;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (3) the issues as framed by the parties;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and (4) the processes served on the parties themselves vis-a-vis the constitutional or law provisions that grant competence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Related to jurisdiction is our application of the doctrine of granting the primary administrative jurisdiction, when statutorily wananted, to the executive department.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This is different from the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> or the doctrine of respect for the hierarchy of courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which are matters of justiciability, not jurisdiction.<br><br>Jurisdiction, once acquired, cam1ot be waived.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Determining whether the case, or any of the issues raised, is justiciable is an exercise of the power granted to a court with jurisdiction over a case that involves constitutional adjudication. Thus, even if this Court has jurisdiction, the canons of constitutional adjudication in our jurisdiction allow us to disregard the questions raised at our discretion.<br><br>The general rule with respect to justiciability is one of constitutional avoidance. That is, before we proceed with even considering how a word or phrase in the Constitution is violated, we first examine whether there is an actual case or controversy. The justiciability of a controversy is often couched in four (4) elements: (1) that there is an actual case or controversy;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (2) that the party raising the issues has <i>locus standi</i>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (3) that the case is ripe for adjudication;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and (4) that the constitutional issue is the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The third element may be rephrased into two (2) queries. The court considers whether the case has already become moot,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> or whether the issues that call for constitutional interpretation are prematurely raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The doctrine of avoidance is palpable when we refuse to decide on the constitutional issue by ruling that the parties have not exhausted administrative remedies,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> or that they have violated the doctrine of respect for the hierarchy of courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> These are specific variants or corollaries of the rule that the case should be ripe for constitutional adjudication.<br><br>The fourth element allows this Court to grant or deny the reliefs prayed for by any petitioner if there is a statutory or procedural rule that can be applied to resolve the issues raised, rather than deal with the interpretation of a constitutional issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> imbues these rules with its libertarian character. Principally, <i>Angara</i> emphasized the liberal deference to another constitutional department or organ given the majoritarian and representative character of the political deliberations in their forums. It is not merely a judicial stance dictated by courtesy, but is rooted on the very nature of this Court. Unless congealed in constitutional or statutory text and imperatively called for by the actual and non-controversial facts of the case, this Court does not express policy. This Court should channel democratic deliberation where it should take place.<br><br>When interpretations of a constitutional provision are equally valid but lead to contrary results, this Court should exercise judicial restraint and allow the political forces to shed light on a choice. This Court steps in only when it discerns clear fallacies in the application of certain norms or their interpretation. Judicial restraint requires that this Court does not involve itself into matters in which only those who join in democratic political deliberation should participate. As magistrates of the highest court, we should distinguish our role from that of an ordinary citizen who can vote.<br><br>Judicial restraint is also founded on a policy of conscious and deliberate caution. This Court should refrain from speculating on the facts of a case and should allow parties to shape their case instead. Likewise, this Court should avoid projecting hypothetical situations where none of the parties can fully argue simply because they have not established the facts or are not interested in the issues raised by the hypothetical situations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In a way, courts are mandated to adopt an attitude of judicial skepticism. What we think may be happening may not at all be the case. Therefore, this Court should always await the proper case to be properly pleaded and proved.<br><br>Plainly put, majority opinions that rule on constitutional issues as <i>obiter dictum</i> is dangerous not only because it is injudicious, but also because it undermines the constitutional framework of governance.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Thus, I propose that we further tame the concept that a case's "transcendental importance"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> creates exceptions to justiciability. The elements supported by the facts of an actual case, and the imperatives of our role as the Supreme Court within a specific cultural or historic context, must be made clear. They should be properly pleaded by the petitioner so that whether there is any transcendental importance to a case is made an issue. That a case has transcendental importance, as applied, may have been too ambiguous and subjective that it undermines the structural relationship that this Court has with the sovereign people and other departments under the Constitution. Our rules on jurisdiction and our interpretation of what is justiciable, refined with relevant cases, may be enough.<br><br>However, consistent with this opinion, we cannot wholly abandon the doctrinal application of cases with transcendental impmtance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> That approach just does not apply in this case. Here, we have just established that cases calling for questions of fact generally cannot be cases from which we establish transcendental importance. Generally, we follow the doctrine of respect for hierarchy of courts for matters within our concurrent original jurisdiction.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Critically, the nuances of the cases we find justiciable signal our philosophy of adjudication. Even as we try to filter out and dispose of the cases pending in our docket, this Court's role is not simply to settle disputes. This Court also perfonns the important public function of clarifying the values embedded in our legal order anchored on the Constitution, laws, and other issuances by competent authorities.<br><br>As this Court finds ways to dispose of its cases, it should be sensitive to the quality of the doctrines it emphasizes and the choice of cases on which it decides. Both of these will facilitate the vibrant democracy and achievement of social justice envisioned by our Constitution.<br><br>Every case filed before this Court has the potential of undoing the act of a majority in one (1) of the political and co-equal departments of our government. Our Constitution allows that its congealed and just values be used by a reasonable minority to convince this Court to undo the majority's action. In doing so, this Court is required to make its reasons precise, transparent, and responsive to the arguments pleaded by the parties. The trend, therefore, should be to clarify broad doctrines laid down in the past. The concept of a case with transcendental impmiance is one (1) of them.<br><br>Our democracy, after all, is a reasoned democracy: one with a commitment not only to the majority's rule, but also to fundamental and social rights.<br><br>Even as we recall the canonical doctrines that inform the structure of our Constitution, we should never lose sight of the innovations that our fundamental law has introduced. We have envisioned a more engaged citizenry and political forums that welcome formerly marginalized communities and identities. Hence, we have encoded the concepts of social justice, acknowledged social and human rights, and expanded the provisions in our Bill of Rights.<br><br>We should always be careful that in our desire to achieve judicial efficiency, we do not filter cases that bring out these values.<br><br>This Court, therefore, has a duty to realize this vision. The more guarded but active part of judicial review pertains to situations where there may have been a deficit in democratic participation, especially where the hegemony or patriarchy ensures the inability of discrete and insular minorities to participate fully. While this Court should presume representation in the deliberative and political forums, it should not be blind to present realities.<br><br>Certainly, this case falls woefully short of these noble expectations.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the Petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>See Knights of Rizal v.
