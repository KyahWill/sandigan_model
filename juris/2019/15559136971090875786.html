Sanoy (PO1 Sanoy) as the poseur buyer and PO1 Rodrigo J. Nidoy, Jr. (PO1 Nidoy) as the back-up arresting officer, to apprehend a certain "Jessie" who, purportedly, was involved in illegal drug activities at Aurelia St., Barangay Bagong Hog, Pasig City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After the alleged sale had been consummated, PO1 Nidoy arrested Trinidad, frisked him, and recovered from the latter a 0.38 caliber revolver loaded with six (6) live ammunitions tucked at his back, as well as a 0.22 caliber rifle loaded with seven (7) live ammunitions and two (2) magazines (subject firearms and ammunition) which were found beside the gate of his house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> When asked if he has any documentation for the same, Trinidad claimed that they were merely pawned to him. After marking the seized items, they proceeded to the nearby barangay hall and conducted inventory and photography thereof, and then went to the police station where the request for ballistic examination was made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Finally, the seized items were brought to the crime laboratory, where, after examination, it was revealed that "the firearms are serviceable and the ammunitions are live and serviceable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> During trial, Trinidad's counsel agreed to the stipulation that Trinidad has no license to possess or carry firearms of any caliber at the time of his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> For his part, Trinidad denied the accusations against him, claiming, among others, that aside from the present case, he was also charged with the crime of Illegal Sale and Possession of Dangerous Drugs, which arose from the same incident, but was, however, acquitted<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> therein for, <em>inter alia</em>, <b><u>failure of the prosecution to prove that Trinidad was validly arrested thru a legitimate buy-bust operation</u></b>. He then formally offered in evidence the said acquittal ruling, which was objected by the public prosecutor for being immaterial and irrelevant to the present case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The RTC admitted said evidence only as part of Trinidad's testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated November 7, 2016, the RTC found Trinidad guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of violation of RA 10591, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day, as minimum, to eleven (11) years and four (4) months of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum, for each count.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> The RTC found that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition, considering that: (<em>a</em>) PO1 Nidoy positively identified the firearms presented before the court as the same firearms seized and recovered from Trinidad's possession; and (<em>b</em>) Trinidad admitted that he is not a holder of any license or permit from the PNP Firearms and Explosives Unit. It gave credence to the positive, clear, and categorical testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses rather than Trinidad's defenses of denial and alibi.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It likewise held that Trinidad's acquittal in the drugs charges is immaterial to this case, opining that the ground for his acquittal is neither unlawful arrest nor unlawful search and seizure, but the procedural flaw in the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p>Aggrieved, Trinidad appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> to the CA. </p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated January 25, 2018, the CA affirmed Trinidad's conviction with modification, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to ten (10) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum, for each count.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The CA ruled that the evidence for the prosecution convincingly established all the elements of the crime charged as Trinidad: (a) was caught in possession and control of two (2) firearms, consisting of one (1) .38 caliber<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> revolver loaded with six (6) live ammunitions and one (1) .22 caliber rifle loaded with seven (7) live ammunitions, as well as two (2) magazines during the conduct of the buy-bust operation; and (b) failed to show any permit or license to possess the same, simply claiming that the said firearms were pawned to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It likewise noted that Trinidad's counsel agreed to the stipulation that Trinidad has no license to possess or carry the subject firearms at the time of his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Finally, it agreed with the RTC's opinion that Trinidad's acquittal in the drugs charges was due to the prosecution's failure to prove the chain of custody of the seized dangerous drugs, and not due to his supposed questionable arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Dissatisfied, Trinidad moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> but was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated May 31, 2018; hence, this petition. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> </p><p>The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld Trinidad's conviction for the crime charged. </p><p align="center"><b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition is meritorious. </p><p> "At the outset, it must be stressed that in criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> "Section 2,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Article III of the 1987 Constitution mandates that <b>a search and seizure must be carried out through or on the strength of a judicial warrant predicated upon the existence of probable cause, <u>absent which, such search and seizure becomes 'unreasonableâ€™ within the meaning of said constitutional provision</u></b>. To protect the people from unreasonable searches and seizures, Section 3 (2),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that <strong>evidence obtained from unreasonable searches and seizures shall be inadmissible in evidence for any purpose in any proceeding</strong>. In other words, evidence obtained and confiscated on the occasion of such unreasonable searches and seizures are deemed tainted and should be excluded for being the proverbial fruit of a poisonous tree."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> "One of the recognized exceptions to the need for a warrant before a search may be affected is a search incidental to a lawful arrest. <b>In this instance, the law requires that there first be a lawful arrest before a search can be made â€“ <u>the process cannot be reversed</u></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p>A lawful arrest may be affected with or without a warrant. With respect to the latter, a warrantless arrest may be done when, <em>inter alia</em>, the accused is caught <em>in flagrante delicto</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> such as in buy-bust operations in drugs cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> However, if the existence of a valid buy-bust operation cannot be proven, and thus, the validity of the<em> in flagrante delicto</em> warrantless arrest cannot be established, the arrest becomes illegal and the consequent search incidental thereto becomes unreasonable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Resultantly, all the evidence seized by reason of the unlawful arrest is inadmissible in evidence for any purpose in any proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> In this case, Trinidad essentially anchors his defense on the following contentions: (<em>a</em>) his arrest stemmed from a purported buy-bust operation where the illegal drugs and the subject firearms and ammunition were allegedly recovered from him; (<em>b</em>) this resulted in the filing of three (3) Informations against him, two (2) of which are for violations of RA 9165<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (which were tried jointly), while the other pertains to the instant case; and (c) his acquittal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> in the drugs cases should necessarily result in his acquittal in this case as well. In finding these contentions untenable, the courts a quo opined that the resolution in the drugs cases is immaterial in this case as they involve different crimes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and that "the ground for the acquittal x x x is neither unlawful arrest nor unlawful search or seizure, but the procedural flaw in the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> However, a more circumspect review of the decision absolving Trinidad of criminal liability in the drugs cases reveals that he was acquitted therein not only due to unjustified deviations from the chain of custody rule,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> but also on the ground that <b><u>the prosecution failed to prove the existence of a valid buy-bust operation, thereby rendering Trinidad's <i>in flagrante delicto</i> warrantless arrest illegal and the subsequent search on him unreasonable</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thus, contrary to the courts a quo's opinions, Trinidad's acquittal in the drugs cases, more particularly on the latter ground, is material to this case because the subject firearms and ammunition were simultaneously recovered from him when he was searched subsequent to his arrest on account of the buy-bust operation.</p><p> The Court is aware that the findings on the illegality of Trinidad's warrantless arrest were made in the drugs cases, which are separate and distinct from the present illegal possession of firearms and ammunition case. Nevertheless, the Court is not precluded from taking judicial notice of such findings as evidence, and apply them altogether for the judicious resolution of the same issue which was duly raised herein. To be sure, the general rule is that the courts are not authorized to take judicial notice of the contents of the records of other cases. However, this rule admits of exceptions, such as when the other case has a close connection with the matter in controversy in the case at hand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In <i>Bongato v. Spouses Malvar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> [A]s a general rule, courts do not take judicial notice of the evidence presented in other proceedings, even if these have been tried or are pending in the same court or before the same judge. There are exceptions to this rule. Ordinarily, an appellate court cannot refer to the record in another case to ascertain a fact not shown in the record of the case before it, yet, it has been held that it may consult decisions in other proceedings, in order to look for the law that is determinative of or applicable to the case under review. <b><u>In some instances, courts have also taken judicial notice of proceedings in other cases that are closely connected to the matter in controversy. These cases "may be so closely interwoven, or so clearly interdependent, as to invoke a rule of judicial notice</u></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Here, an examination of the ruling<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> in the drugs cases (which Trinidad offered as evidence and the RTC admitted as part of his testimony<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>) confirms that the drugs cases and this case are so interwoven and interdependent of each other since, as mentioned, the drugs, as well as the subject firearms and ammunition, were illegally seized in a singular instance,<em> i.e</em>., the buy-bust operation. Hence, the Court may take judicial notice of the circumstances attendant to the buy-bust operation as found by the court which resolved the drugs cases. To recall, in the drugs cases, the finding of unreasonableness of search and seizure of the drugs was mainly based on the failure of PO1 Sanoy's testimony to establish the legitimacy of the buy-bust operation against Trinidad as said testimony was found to be highly doubtful and incredible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This circumstance similarly obtains here as in fact, the testimonies of both PO1 Nidoy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and PO1 Sanoy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> in this case essentially just mirror on all material points the latter's implausible narration in the drugs cases. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the subject firearms and ammunition are also inadmissible in evidence for being recovered from the same unreasonable search and seizure as in the drugs cases. Since the confiscated firearms and ammunition are the very <em>corpus delicti</em> of the crime charged in this case, Trinidad's acquittal is in order. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
