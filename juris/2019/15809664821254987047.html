A government-owned or controlled corporation is either a "parent" corporation, <i>i.e</i>., one "created by special law" (Sec. 3 (a), <u>PD 2029</u>) or a "subsidiary" corporation, <i>i.e.,</i> one created pursuant to law where at least a majority of the outstanding voting capital stock is owned by the parent government corporation and/or other government-owned subsidiaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The COA's audit jurisdiction extends not only to government agencies or instrumentalities, but also to "government-owned and controlled corporations with original charters as well as other government-owned or controlled corporations" without original charters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In <i><b>GSIS Family Bank Employees Union v.

Possessing all three (3) attributes is necessary to be classified as a government-owned or controlled corporation. In the case of the PICCI, it may not be an originally chartered corporation, but it is a subsidiary corporation of BSP organized in accordance with the Corporation Code of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The personality of PICCI as a GOCC subsidiary of BSP has already been settled in <i><b>Singson</b></i>, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The PICCI is not an originally chartered corporation, but a subsidiary corporation of BSP organized in accordance with the Corporation Code of the Philippines. The Articles of Incorporation of PICCI was registered on July 29, 1976 in the Securities and Exchange Commission. As such, PICCI does not fall within the coverage of NCC No. 67. As a matter of fact, by virtue of P.D. [No.] 520, PICCI is exempt from the coverage of the civil service law and regulations (and Constitution defining coverage of civil service as limited to those with original [charter] (<i>TUCP v. NHA</i>, G.R. No. 49677, May 4, 1989, Article IX-B, Sec. 1). Certainly, if PICCI is not part of the National Government, but a mere subsidiary of a government-owned and/or controlled corporation (BSP), its officers, and more importantly, its directors, are not covered by the term "national government officials and employees" to which NCC No. 67 finds application.</blockquote>Unquestionably, PICCI is a GOCC.

Thus, the payment of representation allowances and bonuses is still in violation of Section 8, IX-B of the 1987 Constitution, as there is no law authorizing its payment.</blockquote><br><i><b>Singson</b></i> pointedly resolved as valid the grant of RATA to members of the PICCI Board of Directors who are also BSP officers, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>Taking NCC No. 67 as a whole then, what it seeks to prevent is the dual collection of RATA by a national official from the budgets of "more than one national agency." We emphasize that the <i>other source</i> referred to in the prohibition is <i>another national agency</i>. This can be gleaned from the fact that the sentence "no one shall be allowed to collect RATA from more than one source" (the controversial prohibition) immediately follows the sentence that RATA shall be paid from the budget of the national agency where the concerned national officials and employees draw their salaries. The fact that the other source is another national agency is supported by RA 7645 (the GAA of 1993) invoked by respondent COA itself and, in fact, by all subsequent GAAs for that matter, because the GAAs all essentially provide that (1) the RATA of national officials shall be payable from the budgets of their respective national agencies and (2) those officials on detail with other national agencies shall be paid their RATA only from the budget of their parent national agency:<br><br><div align="CENTER">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div><br>Clearly therefore, the prohibition in NCC No. 67 is only against the dual or multiple collection of RATA by a national official from the budgets of two or more national agencies. Stated otherwise, when a national official is on detail with another national agency, he should get his RATA only from his parent national agency and not from the other national agency he is detailed to.<sup>19</sup> (Italics supplied.)<br><br>Moreover, Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act) defines that the powers and functions of the BSP shall be exercised by the BSP Monetary Board, which is composed of seven (7) members appointed by the President of the Philippines for a term of six (6) years. MB Resolution No. 15,<sup><u>20</u></sup> dated January 5, 1994, as amended by MB Resolution No. 34, dated January 12, 1994, are valid corporate acts of petitioners that became the bases for granting them additional monthly RATA of P1,500.00, as members of the Board of Directors of PICCI. The RATA is distinct from salary (as a form of compensation). Unlike salary which is paid for services rendered, the RATA is a form of allowance intended to defray expenses deemed unavoidable in the discharge of office. Hence, the RATA is paid only to certain officials who, by the nature of their offices, incur representation and transportation expenses.<sup><u>21</u></sup> Indeed, aside from the RATA that they have been receiving from the BSP, the grant of P1,500.00 RATA to each of the petitioners for every board meeting they attended, in their capacity as members of the Board of Directors of PICCI, in addition to their P1,000.00 <i>per diem</i>, does not run afoul the constitutional proscription against double compensation.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>The Court upholds the findings of respondent that petitioners' right to compensation as members of the PICCI Board of Directors is limited only to per diem of P1,000.00 for every meeting attended, by virtue of the PICCI By-Laws. In the same vein, we also clarify that there has been no double compensation despite the fact that, apart from the RATA they have been receiving from the BSP, petitioners have been granted the RATA of P1,500.00 for every board meeting they attended, in their capacity as members of the Board of Directors of PICCI, pursuant to MB Resolution No. 15<sup><u>23</u></sup> dated January 5, 1994, as amended by MB Resolution No. 34 dated January 12, 1994, of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. In this regard, we take into consideration the good faith of petitioners.</blockquote>Applying <i><b>Singson</b></i> here, we rule that like the grant of per diems, the payment of RATA to petitioners Tentangco, Suratos and De Zuñiga does not violate the constitutional proscription against double compensation.<br><br>In any event, the COA contradicted itself when in one breadth, it acknowledged the application of <i><b>Singson</b></i> to this case, but in another, it disallowed the grant of RATA to aforenamed petitioners for supposed lack of valid authority. In truth, <i><b>Singson</b></i> is one such valid authority supporting the grant of RATA to petitioners. The other sources of such authority are MB Resolution No. 34 dated January 12, 1994, No. 665 dated July 3, 1996, No. 1919 dated October 31, 2000, No. 1518 dated December 7, 2006, No. 1901 dated December 29, 2009, and No. 1855 dated December 23, 2010. These resolutions were passed by the PICCI Board of Directors and approved no less by the BSP-MB pursuant to Section 30 Corporation Code, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Sec. 30. <i>Compensation of Directors,</i> - In the absence of any provision in the by-laws fixing their compensation, the directors shall not receive any compensation, as such directors, except for reasonable <i>per diems</i>; Provided, however, that any such compensation (other than <i>per diems</i>) may be granted to directors by the vote of the stockholders representing at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock at a regular or special stockholders' meeting. In no case shall the total yearly compensation of directors, as such directors, exceed ten (10%) percent of the net income before income tax of the corporation during the preceding year.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>Other Bonuses</b><br></center><br>We agree with the COA's pronouncement that the other bonuses granted to petitioners in addition to per diems and RATA were unauthorized.<br><br>By definition, "bonus" is a gratuity or act of liberality of the giver. It is something given in addition to what is ordinarily received by or strictly due the recipient. It is granted and paid to an employee for his industry and loyalty which contributed to the success of the employer's business and made possible the realization of profits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It is not a gift, but a sum paid for services, or upon some other consideration, but in addition to or in excess of that which would ordinarily be given.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Verily, bonus is a form of compensation for services rendered: the very evil sought to be curbed under Section 8, Art. IX-B of the 1987 Constitution, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Section 8. No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double, or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law, nor accept without the consent of the Congress, any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind from any foreign government. Pensions or gratuities shall not be considered as additional, double, or indirect compensation.</blockquote><br><i><b>The increases in petitioners'<br>per diems and RAT A are valid.</b></i><br><br>As a GOCC, the PICCI is governed by compensation and position standards issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and relevant laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Among them is Memorandum Order No. 20<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> directing the suspension of any increases on the benefits of GOCC employees and executives, thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Immediately suspend the grant of any salary increases and new or increased benefits such as, but not limited to, allowances; incentives; reimbursement of expenses; intelligence, confidential or discretionary funds; extraordinary expenses, and such other benefits <b><i>not in accordance with those granted under SSL</i></b>. This suspension shall cover senior officer level positions, including Members of the Board of Directors or Trustees.</blockquote>Memorandum Order No. 20 aims to rationalize or harmonize the compensation and benefits of senior officers in the government both in the GOCCs and National Government. Its <i>Whereas Clause</i> provides:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the study revealed a much superior pay package in GOCCs, GFIs and subsidiaries exempted from the SSL, such that officers in these entities receive at least twice what comparable positions receive in NGAs, and some heads of said entities even exceed the average salary of their counterpart positions in the private sector in the Philippines and in the ASEAN Region;<br><br>WHEREAS, Section 5, Article IX-B of the 1997 Constitution provides for the standardization of compensation of government officials and employees including those in GOCCs with original charters taking into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to and the qualifications required for their positions;<br><br>WHEREAS, in line therewith <i><b>there is a need to harmonize the pay practices in these entities and place them at a level comparable to positions in NGAs to preclude dichotomy in the bureaucracy brought about by the severe pay imbalance between personnel of these special entities and the rest of the bureaucracy following the SSL;</b></i></blockquote>In fine, the proscribed increases under Memorandum Order No. 20 refer only to those in excess of the benefits given to government officials holding comparable positions in the National Government. On this score, the amounts of RATA and per diems granted to officials of the National Government for 2010 were those specified under RA 9770 or the General Appropriations Act of 2010, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Sec. 47. Representation and Transportation Allowances. The following officials of National Government Agencies, whil in the actual performance of their respective functions, are hereby authorized monthly commutable representation and transportation allowances payable from the programmed appropriations provided for their respective offices at rates indicated below, which shall apply to each type of allowance at:<br><br>(a) P11,000 for Department Secretaries;<br>(b) P8,700 for Department Undersecretaries;<br>(c) P7,800 for Department Assistant Secretaries;<br>(d) P7,000 for Bureau Directors and Department Regional Directors;<br>(e) P6,500 for Assistant Bureau Directors, Department Assistant Regional Directors Bureau Regional Directors, and Department Service Chiefs;<br>(f) P5,500 for Assistant Bureau Regional Directors; and<br>(g) P4,000 for Chief of Divisions, identified as such in the Personal Services Itemization and Plantilla of Personnel.<br><br>The determination of those that are of equivalent ranks with the above cited officials in the government shall be made by the DBM.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>Sec. 49. Honoraria. The respective agency appropriations for honoraria shall only be paid to the following:<br><blockquote>(a) Teaching personnel of the DepEd, TESDA, SUCs and other educational institutions, engaged in actual classroom teaching, whose&nbsp;&nbsp; teaching load is outside of the regular office hours or in excess of the regular load;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in seminars, training programs, and other similar activities in training institutions, including those conducted by entities for their officials and employees wherein no seminar&nbsp;&nbsp; fees are collected from participants;<br><br>(c) Chairs and members of commissions, boards, councils, and other similar entities, including the personnel thereof who are not&nbsp; paid salaries nor per diems but compensated in the form of honoraria as provided by law, rules and regulations;</blockquote>The grant of honoraria to the foregoing shall be subject to the guidelines prescribed under Budget Circular No. 2003-5, <i>as amended by Budget Circular No. 2007-1 and National Budget Circular No. 2007-510, Budget Circular No. 2007-2, and other guidelines issued by the DBM</i>.</blockquote>Here, the COA disapproved the grant of per diems and RATA increases to its <i>ex officio</i> members, without at all considering the foregoing guidelines. As it was, the COA issued a bulk disallowance of the increases, sans any determination whether the same were indeed in excess of the amounts received by petitioners' counterparts in the National Government. Surely, Memorandum Order No. 20 intends to rationalize the benefits of the government employees, not to discriminate GOCCs.<br><br>In line with the declared policy of the national government which is to provide "equal pay for substantially equal work. Sec. 5, IX-B of the Constitution commands:<br><blockquote>Section 5. The Congress shall provide for the standardization of compensation of government officials and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, taking into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required for, their positions.</blockquote><i><b>Executive Order No. 24</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><i><b>applies prospectively.</b></i><br><br>The disallowed benefits here were given by the PICCI Board/BSP-MB between January 2010 February 2011. Executive Order No. 24 requiring the approval of the Philippine President for any increase on the current rate of per diems took effect only on March 21, 2011. Executive Order No. 24, therefore, should not apply to the increases in question which were granted to petitioners before Executive Order No. 24 took effect.<br><br>Article 4 of the Civil Code ordains that laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided. In the recent case of <i><b>Felisa Agricultural Corp. v. National Transmission Corp.,</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court decreed:<br><blockquote>Statutes are generally applied prospectively unless they expressly allow a retroactive application. It is well known that the principle that a new law shall not have retroactive effect only governs rights arising from acts done under the rule of the former law. However, if a right be declared for the first time by a subsequent law, it shall take effect from that time even though it has arisen from acts subject to the former laws, provided that it does not prejudice another acquired right of the same origin.</blockquote>Since Executive Order No. 24 does not provide for its retroactive application, the same may not be applied for the purpose of deauthorizing the grant of benefits prior to its effectivity. At most, it may serve as guidelines to acts done upon its effectivity onward.<br><br><b><i>The newly submitted evidence before<br>the COA-Proper are admissible.</i></b><br><br>In their appeal first before the COA-Corporate Government Sector, and subsequently before the COA-Proper, petitioners consistently invoked as valid bases for the questioned grant of per diem and RAT A, PICCI's amended by-laws and MB Resolution No. 34 dated January 12, 1994, No. 665 dated July 3, 1996, and No. 1919 dated October 31, 2000.<br><br>In its Decision dated February 16, 2017, the COA-Proper allowed the grant of P1,000.00 per diem, but disallowed the grant of RATA and the subsequent increases in both per diems and RATA. The COA Proper enumerated the reasons for the disallowance: a) the amended PICCI By-Laws even if approved by the BSP-Monetary Board cannot take effect unless the SEC itself issued the Certification required under Sec. 48 of the Corporation Code; b) the increases in the per diems were not supported by Board Resolutions; and c) the PICCI By-Laws allowed payment of per diems only, not of RATA or other benefits.<br><br>In support of their motion for reconsideration below, petitioners attached thereto the following documents --- the SEC Certification on PICCI Amended By-Laws; MB Resolution No. 1518 dated December 7, 2006; MB Resolution No. 1901 dated December 29, 2009; and MB Resolution No. 1855 dated December 23, 2010, etc.<br><br>To begin with, there is nothing in the 2009 COA Rules of procedure which prohibits the parties from presenting or submitting additional documents during the appeal proceedings before the COA proper. At any rate, there is no showing, as none was shown, that the aforesaid public documents were spurious, as to bar them from admission as evidence.<br><br>In any case, the submission of these documents on motion for reconsideration before COA Proper was simply in direct response to the COA's adverse findings in its assailed decision.<br><br>Notably, the COA Proper itself did not deny the admission of the documents in question. It is too late in the day for COA to now fault the submission of the documents before it on motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Suffice it to state that technical rules of procedure do not strictly apply to administrative cases. The parties therein should be given the amplest opportunity to fully ventilate their claims and defenses, brushing aside technicalities in order to truly ascertain the relevant facts and justly resolve the case on the merits. After all, procedural rules are intended to secure, not override, substantial justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> So must it be.<br><br><b>Singson is favorable to<br>petitioners.</b><br><br>As earlier stated, <i><b>Singson</b></i> held that the grant of per diems and RATA to petitioners' predecessors in the PICCI Board of Directors who were also officers of BSP did not violate the proscription against double compensation, thus:<br><blockquote>Moreover, Section 6 of Republic Act No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act) defines that the powers and functions of the BSP shall be exercised by the BSP Monetary Board, which is composed of seven (7) members appointed by the President of the Philippines for a term of six (6) years.
