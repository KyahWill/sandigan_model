Spouses Conception</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court explained the nature of an equitable mortgage, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Article 1602 of the New Civil Code of the Philippines provides that a contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage, in any of the following cases:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">When the price of a sale with right to repurchase is unusually inadequate;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the vendor remains in possession as lessee or otherwise;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When upon or after the expiration of the right to repurchase another instrument extending the period of redemption or granting a new period is executed;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the purchaser retains for himself a part of the purchase price;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the vendor binds himself to pay the taxes on the thing sold;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(6) </div></td><td><div align="justify">In any other case where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>In any of the foregoing case, any money, fruits, or other benefit to be received by the vendee as rent or otherwise shall be considered as interest which shall be subject to the usury laws.<br></blockquote>The provision shall apply to a contract purporting to be an absolute sale. <u>In case of doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase shall be considered as an equitable mortgage. In a contract of mortgage, the mortgagor merely subjects the property to a lien, but the ownership and possession thereof are retained by him.</u><br><br>For the presumption in Article 1602 of the New Civil Code to arise, two requirements must concur: (a) that the parties entered into a contract denominated as a contract of sale; and (b) that their intention was to secure an existing debt by way of a mortgage. The existence of any of the circumstances defined in Article 1602 of the New Civil Code, not the concurrence nor an overwhelming number of such circumstances[,] is sufficient for a contract of sale to be presumed an equitable mortgage.<br><br>If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control. However, if the records appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the contracting parties, the latter shall prevail.<br><br><u>The nomenclature given by the parties to the contract is not conclusive of the nature and legal effects thereof. Even if a document appears on its face to be a sale, the owner of the property may prove that the contract is really a loan with mortgage, and that the document does not express the true intent of the parties.</u><br><br>There is no conclusive test to determine whether a deed absolute on its face is really a simple loan accommodation secured by a mortgage. <u>The decisive factor in evaluating such deed is the intention of the parties as shown by all the surrounding circumstances, such as the relative situation of the parties at that time, the attitude, acts, conduct, and declarations of the parties before, during and after the execution of said deed, and generally all pertinent facts having a tendency to determine the real nature of their design and understanding.</u> As such, documentary and parol evidence may be adduced by the parties. <u>When in doubt, courts are generally inclined to construe a transaction purporting to be a sale as an equitable mortgage, which involves a lesser transmission of rights and interests over the property in controversy.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>In the instant case, the RTC and CA both held that the subject <i>Memorandum of Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase</i>, while purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase, was, in fact, an equitable mortgage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Factual findings of the lower court, more so when supported by the evidence, as in this case, command not only respect but even finality and are binding on the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Further, the findings of the RTC and the CA on the nature of the transaction have attained finality considering that the respondents never challenged the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Thus, the only issue for resolution before the Court is whether petitioners' action to "redeem" the subject property has prescribed. Both the RTC and the CA held that while the true transaction was one of equitable mortgage under Articles 1602 and 1603 of the Civil Code, petitioners could no longer "repurchase" or "redeem" the subject property as the period for redemption under Article 1606 of the Civil Code has lapsed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <b>This is erroneous.</b> <br><br>An equitable mortgage, like any other mortgage, is a mere accessory contract "constituted to secure the fulfillment of a principal obligation,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <i>i.e.</i>, the full payment of the loan.<br><br>Since the true transaction between the parties was an equitable mortgage and not a sale with right of repurchase, there is no "redemption" or "repurchase" to speak of and the periods provided under Article 1606 do not apply. Instead, the prescriptive period under Article 1144<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the Civil Code is applicable. In other words, the parties had 10 years from the time the cause of action accrued to file the appropriate action.<br><br>A review of the records unequivocally shows that the parties faithfully abided by their true agreement for 19 years counted from the execution of the <i>Memorandum of Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase</i>.<br><br>Although the <i>Memorandum of Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase</i> was executed in 1984 and the period to redeem the same supposedly lapsed in 1994 if such contract were a true sale with right to repurchase, both the RTC and CA found that subsequent loans were extended to either or both of the petitioners in 1987, 2003, and 2004, "using the same land as security for the loan."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> These facts were alleged in petitioners' Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and were not specifically denied in respondents' Answer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The release of additional loans on the basis of the same security, coupled with the fact that respondents never filed an action to consolidate ownership over the subject property under Article 1607,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> evidently shows that for 19 years, respondents expressly recognized: 1) that petitioners continued to own the subject property and 2) that the loan and equitable mortgage subsisted.<br><br>Thus, petitioners' cause of action to recover the subject property can be said to have accrued only in 2004, that is, when respondents rejected petitioners' offers to pay and extinguish the loan and to recover the mortgaged property as it was only at this time that respondents manifested their intention not to comply with the true agreement of the parties. Undoubtedly, <b>the filing of the complaint in 2005 was made well-within the 10-year prescriptive period</b>. Such treatment is more in keeping with the principle that:<br><blockquote>The provisions of the Civil Code governing equitable mortgages disguised as sale contracts, like the one herein, are primarily designed to curtail the evils brought about by contracts of sale with right to repurchase, particularly the circumvention of the usury law and <i>pactum commissorium</i>. Courts have taken judicial notice of the well-known fact that contracts of sale with right to repurchase have been frequently resorted to in order to conceal the true nature of a contract, <i>that is</i>, a loan secured by a mortgage. It is a reality that grave financial distress renders persons hard-pressed to meet even their basic needs or to respond to an emergency, leaving no choice to them but to sign deeds of absolute sale of property or deeds of sale with <i>pacto de retro</i> if only to obtain the much-needed loan from unscrupulous money lenders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents, for their part, are not without remedy. They are entitled to collect the outstanding amount of petitioners' loan, plus interest, and to foreclose on the subject property should the latter fail to pay the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> To allow respondents to appropriate the subject lot without prior foreclosure would produce the same effect as a <i>pactum comissorium</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Upon full satisfaction of the debt, the mortgage, being a security contract, shall be extinguished<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and the property should be returned to herein petitioners. As the records are bereft of any basis for the determination of the outstanding amount of the loan, the Court is left with no choice but to remand the instant case to the RTC for a determination of the outstanding amount of the loan and the imposition of the applicable interest, and for a declaration of whether or not respondents are entitled to foreclose on the equitable mortgage.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated July 10, 2015 and the Resolution dated November 14, 2016 in CA-G.R. CEB-CV. No. 01796 are <b>REVERSED</b>. The instant case is <b>REMANDED</b> to Branch 3, Regional Trial Court, Guiuan, Eastern Samar to determine the outstanding amount of the loan and the applicable interest, to fix a reasonable period for the payment of the same, and to order the return of the subject property only upon full satisfaction thereof.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><br></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Perlas-Bernabe, J.
