Allegedly, she last reported for work on September 21, 2010 where she left the office at 4:14 p.m. and had not reported back since.

The CA affirmed the RTC's findings that the totality of evidence presented by the prosecution established petitioner's guilt of the crimes charged beyond reasonable doubt. The dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision dated 26 October 2016 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Petitioner sought reconsideration of the assailed Decision, but the same was denied in assailed Resolution dated August 1, 2018.<br><br>Hence, the present petition where the petitioner raises the lone issue of:<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT RENDERED THE ASSAILED DECISION AND RESOLUTION, THE SAME NOT BEING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OR WITH APPLICABLE JURISPRUDENCE<br></blockquote>Maintaining that the decision of the CA, along with the RTC, was made contrary to existing laws and jurisprudence, the petitioner argues that there is no direct evidence presented by the prosecution showing she caused the falsification and submission of the subject documents. She reiterates that none of the witnesses for the prosecution was able to categorically state that it was petitioner who submitted the subject DTRs and Applications for Leave with the NBI Personnel Division. The foregoing thus casts serious doubts as to the identity of the true perpetrator and her guilt for the crimes charged.<br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the public respondent People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), submits that the petition should be dismissed as the petitioner failed to show any special or compelling reason that would necessitate the exercise of this Court's review and appellate jurisdiction, as the petitioner merely reiterated her contentions before the CA. The public respondent also points out that the instant petition merely raises questions of fact, which are not proper subjects for review in a Rule 45 petition. The public respondent also maintains that the RTC and the CA correctly ruled that the evidence presented by the prosecution sufficiently established the existence of all the elements of the crime charged and the guilt of the petitioner.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We deny the petition.<br><br><i>First</i>, Jurisprudence is replete with pronouncements that direct evidence is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i> to prove guilt of an accused beyond reasonable doubt. The rationale for this rule is further reiterated in <i>Dungo, et al. v. People of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>x x x Direct evidence is not a condition sine qua non to prove the guilt of an accused beyond reasonable doubt. For in the absence of direct evidence, the prosecution may resort to adducing circumstantial evidence to discharge its burden. <b>Crimes are usually committed in secret and under conditions where concealment is highly probable.</b> If direct evidence is insisted on under all circumstances, the prosecution of vicious felons who commit heinous crimes in secret or secluded places will be hard, if not impossible, to prove. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Certainly, in crimes involving the falsification of a public document, it is possible that secrecy and other surreptitious means may have been employed by the perpetrator precisely to conceal the true nature of a document he claims to be legitimate. In such a case, it is only logical and proper for the prosecution to resort to the presentation of circumstantial evidence in the absence of direct evidence to establish the guilt of the accused.<br><br><i>Second</i>, all the elements of the crimes charged were sufficiently established by the prosecution. Petitioner was charged with six (6) counts of falsification of public documents punishable under Article 171 of the RPC, particularly paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and 5 thereof, to wit:<br><blockquote>Art. 171. Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister. - The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> and a fine not to exceed P5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><br>1. Counterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;<br>2. Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;<br>x x x x<br>4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;<br>5. Altering true dates;<br>x x x<br></blockquote>The elements of falsification under the aforesaid provision are as follows: (1) the offender is a public officer, employee, or a notary public; (2) the offender takes advantage of his or her official position; and (3) The offender falsifies a document by committing any of the acts of falsification under Article 171 of the RPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As to the first element, it is undisputed that at the time of the commission of the crime, the petitioner was a public officer serving as Intelligence Agent I at the NBI-WEMRO.<br><br>As to the second element, an offender is considered to have taken advantage of his official position when (1) he has the duty to make or prepare or otherwise to intervene in the preparation of a document; or (2) he has the official custody of the document which he falsifies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Here, the testimony of NBI-WEMRO Acting Administrative Officer George S. Perez established that petitioner, as an employee of the NBI-WEMRO, has the duty to make or prepare the subject DTRs.<br><br>As to the third element, as correctly found by the CA, evidence presented by the prosecution established that petitioner's continuous absence since September 21, 2010 prompted an investigation against her which led to the discovery of the subject DTRs and Applications for Leave. The subject DTRs included the purported signatures of Embido and Minguez. However, both officers certified that the signatures appearing on the subject DTRs are not theirs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Furthermore, the Questioned Document Report No. 69-211,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or the results of the handwriting examination conducted by the NBI Questioned Documents Division, shows that the signatures on the subject DTRs and the sample signatures of Embido and Minguez were not written by the same person. Additionally, the testimony of Minguez established that he had not seen petitioner report for work for six (6) months.<br><br>Anent the Applications for Leave, a Certification from Corazon A. Villas, Chief of the NBI - Personnel Division indicates that the said division has not received any application for any leave of absence from petitioner for the period of September 21, 2010 to December 8, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The Application for Leave for the period of October 4 to 29, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> further indicates that the same was received by the Personnel Division on January 18, 2011, establishing that the same was not filed on September 17, 2010 as written thereon.<br><br>Verily, the totality of evidence presented by the prosecution established that petitioner, a public officer, has taken advantage of her official position and falsified her DTRs and Applications for Leave by counterfeiting or imitating the signatures of Embido and Minguez, making it appear that the said officers verified her DTRs. Through the subject DTRs, petitioner likewise made untruthful statements in making it appear that she regularly reported for work in September, October, and November, when she actually stopped showing up for work after September 21, 2010. Petitioner likewise altered true dates on her Applications for Leave, making it appear that she had tiled the same on September 17, 2010 when they were actually filed on January 18, 2011.<br><br>It is noteworthy to add that the foregoing findings of fact, as sustained by the CA, binds this Court. Barring the application of recognized exceptions, the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are conclusive and binding on the parties and are not subject to review by the Supreme Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><i>Third and lastly</i>, as previously mentioned, the penalty for falsification of public documents is imprisonment of <i>prision mayor</i> and a fine not exceeding P5,000.00. In the absence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the penalty shall be imposed in its medium period, which is 8 years and 1 day to 10 years. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the petitioner is entitled to a minimum term which shall be taken within the range of the penalty next lower to what is prescribed by law which is <i>prision correccional</i>, the range of which is 6 months and 1 day to 6 years. Meanwhile, the maximum term of the penalty shall be that which is imposed by law considering any attending circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In view of the penalties imposed by the RTC in the instant case, as affirmed by the CA, such penalties are likewise correct.<br><br>All told, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA in affirming the conviction of the petitioner for the crimes charged and rendering the assailed Decision and Resolution.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
