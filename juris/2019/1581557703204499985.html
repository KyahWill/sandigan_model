Part of [DLCI's] scope of work in the Project [was] the supply and installation of glazed aluminum and curtain walling. Part of the terms and conditions of the contract between Rockwell and DLCI (the "Main Contract") [was] the appointment of [Altech] as Rockwell's nominated sub[-]contractor to DLCI for the supply and installation of glazed aluminum and curtain walling.<br><br>On July 30, 1997, in compliance with the agreement between Rockwell and DLCI, Rockwell sent a Notice of Award to Proceed [(NTP)] to Altech for the supply and installation of the glazed aluminum and curtain walling at the Project.

On March 28, 2000, Mercantile advised DLCI that since Altech had informed them that negotiations were underway for an amicable settlement, they would hold further evaluation of DLCI's claim in abeyance "to give enough elbow room to [Altech] to settle [the claim] on [its] own."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After negotiations between DLCI and Altech fell through, DLCI reiterated its demand for liquidation on November 28, 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Mercantile denied DLCI's claim on February 26, 2001 on the ground that the Performance Bond expired on March 5, 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, DLCI filed a complaint against Altech and Mercantile before the CIAC (CIAC Complaint) on May 29, 2003,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> seeking to collect the sum of Php31,618,494.81 representing the costs it allegedly incurred to complete the sub-contracted works, with interest and costs of litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Despite earnest efforts to serve the CIAC Complaint upon Altech, DLCI was unable to do so since Altech was no longer holding office at its registered principal address.

As already held x x x [DLCI] is found guilty of inexcusable delay in filing this claim for arbitration. The consequence of this delay is to deprive [Mercantile] of its right to go after [Altech] on a cross-claim in this suit.

The Court's ruling in <i>Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines v. Asia Paces Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> lends guidance:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <b>[S]ince the surety is a solidary debtor, it is not necessary that the original debtor first failed to pay before the surety could be made liable; it is enough that a demand for payment is made by the creditor for the surety's liability to attach.</b> Article 1216 of the Civil Code provides that:<br><blockquote>Article 1216.

Clearly, Mercantile's liability became due upon its receipt of the First Call.<br><br>In this respect, DLCI's alleged failure to state the value of its claim is of no moment. As astutely observed by the CA:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [The Tribunal] makes much out of DLCI's failure to state the specific amount that it is claiming. It must be emphasized that at the time of the call on the bond, Mercantile's obligation guaranteeing project completion already arose and it is understood that the exact amount, while still undetermined, shall not exceed the amount of the bond [Php90,448,941.60].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Tribunal appears to have overlooked the fact that the First Call demanded for the <i>liquidation</i> of the Performance Bond, that is, the payment of the entire amount for which it was issued. Payments made in response to DLCI's demand for liquidation would have then been subject to <i>subsequent </i>adjustment following the final settlement of Altech and DLCI's respective accounts. This much is clear from the terms of the Performance Bond.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The Performance Bond itself provides that Mercantile's liability is not contingent upon the determination of the actual amount for which Altech is liable. In the event of an overpayment, Mercantile can proceed against DLCI based on the principle of unjust enrichment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Any amount subject to reimbursement would then assume the nature of a forbearance of money, subject to legal interest.<br><br>In any case, it bears stressing that Mercantile made no mention of the purported defect in DLCI's First Call at any time prior to the CIAC proceedings. To recall, Mercantile premised its refusal to evaluate DLCI's claim <i>solely</i> on the pending negotiations between DLCI and Altech. Mercantile's objection regarding the validity and completeness of the First Call, which it belatedly raised during the CIAC proceedings, appears to have been an afterthought.<br><br>For these reasons, the Court finds Mercantile's refusal to evaluate DLCI's claim unjustified.<br><br><i>DLCI is entitled to claim the costs it <br></i></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>incurred&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; consequence&nbsp; of&nbsp; Altech'</i></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>s delay and poor workmanship.</i><br><br>Under the Performance Bond, Altech and Mercantile jointly and severally bound themselves "for the payment of the [Performance] Bond in the event that Altech [should] fail to fully and faithfully undertake and complete its scope of work in strict compliance with the general conditions, plans and specifications, bill of quantities and other documents, which were [furnished to] Altech x x x and which [were] incorporated in said Performance Bond x x x by reference."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In turn, the general conditions of the Sub-Contract between DLCI and Altech provide:<br><br><blockquote>6.

This is apparent from the correspondences,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> which DLCI submitted as evidence. Mercantile had the full opportunity to contest the truthfulness and veracity of these correspondences and the matters to which they pertain. Instead of doing so, Mercantile merely argued that DLCI's failure to "pray for Liquidated Damages and Cost for Rectification of work" belies its claim of delay and poor workmanship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Mercantile's undue reliance on nomenclature does not support its cause. To recall, the CIAC Complaint prayed for the payment of costs incurred to complete the sub-contract works.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> These costs represent those incurred as a consequence of Altech's delay and poor workmanship. Verily, these costs are chargeable against the Performance Bond, inasmuch as the latter stands as a guarantee for Altech's full and faithful compliance with the Sub-Contract.<br><br>Mercantile further attempts to evade liability on the Performance Bond by drawing a distinction <i>between first,</i> costs incurred before <i>and</i> after termination of the Sub-Contract and <i>also, </i> between costs incurred to complete the project and those which are claimed due to overpayment. However, these distinctions are irrelevant to Mercantile's liability under the Performance Bond.<br><br>At the risk of being repetitive, Mercantile's Performance Bond guarantees Altech's full and faithful compliance with the Sub-Contract. Accordingly, the scope of the Performance Bond should be understood to cover all costs incurred by DLCI as a result of Altech's failure to comply with its obligations under said agreement. To limit the scope of the Performance Bond only to costs incurred <i>before</i> termination of the Sub­ Contract would be to create an additional condition for recovery which does not appear on the face of the Performance Bond. To stress, Mercantile's liability is conditioned only upon DLCI's first demand, "notwithstanding any dispute to the effect that the principal has fulfilled its contractual obligation [or] the amount demanded."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>It is likewise erroneous for Mercantile to argue that DLCI's claim is a mere request for reimbursement for overpayment which falls outside of the scope of the Performance Bond.<br><br>Reference to DLCI's breakdown of claims is proper, thus:</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2">1.

The fact that DLCI paid in excess of what Altech is now entitled to under the Sub-Contract does not place the claim beyond the scope of the Performance Bond, inasmuch as the claim results from additional expenses incurred by DLCI to complete the sub-contract works — expenses which DLCI would not have otherwise incurred had Altech fully and faithfully complied with its obligations under the Sub-Contract.<br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Altech's obligation to perform the specified works under the Sub­ Contract constitutes an obligation to do.

Mercantile bases this assertion on Article 2080 of the Civil Code.<br><br><b>It has already been settled that no delay may be attributed to DLCI with respect to the filing of the CIAC Complaint.</b> Nevertheless, even if it is assumed, for the sake of argument, that DLCI was in fact guilty of inexcusable delay, Mercantile's argument still fails.<br><br>A plain reading of Article 2080 indicates that the article applies to guarantors. Mercantile's position that the provision applies with equal force to sureties fails to appreciate the fundamental distinctions between the respective liabilities of a guarantor and a surety.<br><br><blockquote>A surety is an insurer of the debt, whereas a guarantor is an insurer of the solvency of the debtor. A suretyship is an undertaking that the debt shall be paid; a guaranty, an undertaking that the debtor shall pay. Stated differently, a surety promises to pay the principal's debt if the principal will not pay, while a guarantor agrees that the creditor, after proceeding against the principal, may proceed against the guarantor if the principal is unable to pay. <b>A surety binds himself to perform if the principal does not, without regard to his ability to do so.</b> A guarantor, on the other hand, does not contract that the principal will pay, but simply that he is able to do so.<b> In other words, a surety undertakes directly for the payment and is so responsible at once if the principal debtor makes default, while a guarantor contracts to pay if, by the use of due diligence, the debt cannot be made out of the principal debtor.</b> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; emphasis and underscoring in the original omitted)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Bicol Savings&nbsp; &amp; Loan Association&nbsp; v. Guinhawa,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> the Court unequivocally ruled that Article 2080 applies only with respect to the liability of a guarantor. The Court reiterated this ruling in the subsequent case of <i>Ang v. Associated Bank,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> where it held:<br><br><blockquote>As petitioner acknowledged it to be, the relation between an accommodation party and the accommodated party is one of principal and surety — the accommodation party being the surety. As such, he is deemed an original promisor and debtor from the beginning; he is considered in law as the same party as the debtor in relation to whatever is adjudged touching the obligation of the latter since their liabilities are interwoven as to be inseparable. Although a contract of suretyship is in essence accessory or collateral to a valid principal obligation, the surety's liability to the creditor is <i>immediate, primary</i> and <i>absolute;</i> he is <i>directly </i>and <i>equally </i> bound with the principal. <b>As an equivalent of a regular party to the undertaking, a surety becomes liable to the debt and duty of the principal obligor even without possessing a direct or personal interest in the obligations nor does he receive any benefit therefrom.</b><br><br><b>Contrary to petitioner's adamant stand, however, Article </b><b>2080 of the Civil Code does not apply in a contract of suretyship.</b> [Article] 2047 of the Civil Code states that if a person binds himself solidarily with the principal debtor, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I, Book IV of the Civil Code must be observed. Accordingly, Articles 1207 up to 1222 of the Code (on joint and solidary obligations) shall govern the relationship of petitioner[-surety] with the bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original and citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Verily, a surety's liability stands without regard to the debtor's ability to perform his obligations under the contract subject of the suretyship.
