He took AAA as his stepdaughter, supporting her since childhood. He narrated that at 6:00 a.m. on April 12, 2006, he was working on the kitchen in their house while AAA and DDD did the laundry. Meanwhile, BBB proceeded to the barangay hall to check if the toilet bowl they requested was already available.<br><br>ZZZ further narrated that at around 10:00 a.m. on April 12, 2006, DDD and AAA were eating breakfast after they had finished washing clothes. AAA then went up the second floor of their house and slept, while he was then Installing an electric bulb in the kitchen.

He was around 12 meters away from AAA, holding a hammer on the window. BBB then went to AAA and pinched her "bulog[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Afterwards, BBB grabbed a hose and whipped ZZZ, who was able to parry the strike. BBB then went out with AAA only to return the following morning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>ZZZ claimed that BBB was influenced by her cousins to accuse him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The cousins were allegedly mad at him and wanted BBB and him to separate since he was "not a useful person."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, ZZZ stated that the house's window and door were always shut because the house was still unfinished. He restated that when BBB arrived, she saw him standing by the window and AAA sitting at a corner of their house. He reiterated that BBB whipped him with a hose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He added that when he saw AAA crying, he thought that she would not pinpoint him as her rapist "because her conscience [was] bothered."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On August 8, 2008, AAA executed her Affidavit of Recantation and Desistance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> praying that the rape case be dismissed.

Contrary to her Affidavit, she also admitted that she was not under duress when she was presented as a witness. She recalled crying during the direct examination and pointing to ZZZ as her rapist when she was asked. EEE, she added, was their neighbor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In its June 25, 2013 Judgment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Regional Trial Court found ZZZ guilty beyond reasonable doubt of simple statutory rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The trial court found that the prosecution failed to establish AAA's minority.

It further held that instead of discrediting the prosecution's evidence, AAA's Affidavit of Recantation and Desistance bolstered her earlier statements by reaffirming that: (1) ZZZ sexually molested her; (2) the prosecutor did not force her to testify; and (3) she was not put under duress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Judgment read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, based on the prevailing facts, evidences, law and jurisprudence applicable, the court finds accused [ZZZ] GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of simple statutory rape and hereby sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.

Pointing out that AAA's alleged age in the Information was 14 years old, he argues that under the law and jurisprudence, the victim must be below 12 years old for the crime to be statutory rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant avers that since the case does not involve statutory rape, the presence of force, intimidation, threat, fraud, or grave abuse of authority must be established in the alleged crime's commission. He contends that the prosecution failed to show these circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Moreover, accused-appellant alleges that AAA's "[inconsistent and improbable statements[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> particularly on direct examination and on her Affidavit of Recantation and Desistance, raised doubts on the credibility of her allegations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also points out that Dr. Dacula only found redness and abrasion, and not hymenal laceration, which should have been present had there been sexual intercourse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> These manifestations "could have been easily caused by pinching, scratching, or wearing very tight underwear."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Lastly, accused-appellant argues that the prosecution should not draw its strength on the alleged weakness of the defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He maintains that he should be acquitted considering that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Plaintiff-appellee counters that accused-appellant was actually convicted not of statutory rape, but of simple rape, and was meted with the penalty of simple rape. Hence, even if the trial court erroneously included the word "statutory" in describing the crime, there was no effect in the imposed penalty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Plaintiff-appellee insists that accused-appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> It was able to establish the following elements:<br><blockquote><i>First</i>. [AAA] was then 14-year old when appellant had sexual intercourse with her.<br><br><i>Second</i>. Appellant who is the common-law husband of [AAA's] mother exercises moral ascendancy and authority over her.<br><br><i>Third</i>. [AAA] testified that appellant had carnal knowledge of her on April 12, 2006 at about 11:00 o'clock (<i>sic</i>) in the morning while her mother went to the Barangay Hall to do an errand for appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Plaintiff-appellee maintains that AAA's narration of the incident proves that accused-appellant raped her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> It adds that recantations are usually viewed unfavorably since it can be secured by intimidating the witness or in exchange of monetary consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It alleges that AAA's recantation was doubtful because BBB and accused-appellant continued their common-law relationship and AAA's new claim "was a mere legal conclusion, bereft of any details or other indicia of credibility, much less truth."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Finally, plaintiff-appellee contends that AAA's intact hymen is not fatal to its cause. In the crime of rape to be consummated, it is sufficient that the penis touched the pudendum or the labia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not accused-appellant ZZZ's guilt for the crime of rape has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In arguing for his innocence, accused-appellant maintains that the element of force, intimidation, threat, fraud, or grave abuse of authority in the crime of rape was not established, and that the element of the victim's minority in the crime of statutory rape was not proven. Moreover, AAA's recantation and her intact hymen both negate the allegation of rape.<br><br>Accused-appellant's contentions have no merit.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code defines rape as: <br><blockquote>Article 266-A. Rape; When and How Committed. — Rape is committed —<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Through force, threat, or intimidation;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">c)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">d)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>2) By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.<br></blockquote>After a careful examination of the case records, this Court holds that the prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant is guilty of raping AAA. The trial court also found AAA's testimony credible and supported by evidence:<br><blockquote>The candid, straightforward and unrehearsed testimony of victim [AAA] who declared against the bestial acts of the accused on her person and maintained that she was required to hold his penis and thereafter, again, rode on top of her placing his penis on her vagina is corroborated by the unrefuted findings of Dr. Edalin L. Dacula who found that the abrasion and redness in color on the right side of the labia minora is caused by a smooth, soft object. A smooth, soft object is a penis and that the abrasion and redness in color on the right side of the labia minora is caused probably by the friction of the hardened and erected penis of the accused. That was why the victim complained that she felt pain on her vagina.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals, likewise, found that AAA's testimony during the direct examination showed that she clearly remembered how accused-appellant committed the crime:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

In <i>People v.

Trial provides judges with the opportunity to detect, consciously or unconsciously, observable cues and microexpressions that could, more than the words said and taken as a whole, suggest sincerity or betray lies and ill will. These important aspects can never be reflected or reproduced in documents and objects used as evidence.<br><br>Hence, "[t]he evaluation of the witnesses' credibility is a matter best left to the trial court because it has the opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor during the trial. Thus, the Court accords great respect to the trial court's findings," more so when the Court of Appeals affirmed such findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>There is also no merit in accused-appellant's argument that force, intimidation, threat, fraud, or grave abuse of authority was not present.

A healed or fresh laceration would of course be a compelling proof of defloration. What is more, the foremost consideration in the prosecution of rape is the victim's testimony and not the findings of the medico-legal officer. In fact, a medical examination of the victim is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape; the victim's testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The guilt of accused-appellant having been proven beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of rape, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> was correctly imposed.
