				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">There is very little that seafarers can do to better their working conditions upon boarding a ship. It is the shipowners and their representatives who have better resources to ensure that their crew members are properly nourished, kept adequately fit, and are placed in a situation where they are not put at any risk greater than what is inherent in their jobs. After all, a crew properly nourished, adequately fit, and enjoying humane working conditions will redound to the benefit of the shipowners. No ship sails without a human crew. Consequently, the crew's quality of skills and state of health significantly determine the efficiency of the shipping business. Taking responsibility for the health of all human souls on their ships also defines the shipowners' sense of humanity and justice.<br><br>This resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Oscar M.

Transmed Manila Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> laid down the parameters of judicial review for a labor case under Rule 45:<br><blockquote>In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a CA ruling in a labor case. In question form, the question to ask is: Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>A court or tribunal is said to have acted with grave abuse of discretion when it capriciously acts or whimsically exercises judgment. The abuse of discretion must be so flagrant that it amounts to a virtual refusal to perform a duty as provided by law. "Mere abuse of discretion is not enough."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>A review of the records convinces this Court that the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission were amply supported by substantial evidence.<br><br>To grant a seafarer's claim for disability benefits, the following requisites must be present:<br><blockquote>(1) [H]e suffered an illness; (2) he suffered this illness during the term of his employment contract; (3) he complied with the procedures prescribed under Section 20-B; (4) his illness is one of the enumerated occupational disease[s] or that his illness or injury is otherwise work-related; and (5) he complied with the four conditions enumerated under Section 32-A for an occupational disease or a disputably-presumed work-related disease to be compensable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>It is not disputed that petitioner was initially diagnosed with heart disease, anemia, renal dysfunction, and that he fell ill while he was aboard the Tsavrilis Hellas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This resulted in his medical repatriation and arrival m Manila on February 9, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Likewise, petitioner submitted himself to a post-employment medical examination conducted by a company-designated physician.

Occupational Diseases. -<br><br>For an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied:<br><ol><li>The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein;<br><br></li><li>The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks;<br><br></li><li>The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it; and<br><br></li><li>There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner's heart ailments are classified under a cardiovascular event, as defined in Section 32-A(11) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract:<br><blockquote>Section 32-A. Occupational Diseases. - <br><br>....<br><br>The following diseases are considered as occupational when contracted under working conditions involving the risks described herein:<br><br>Occupational Disease<br><br>....<br><br>11. Cardio-vascular events - to include heart attack, chest pain (angina), heart failure or sudden death. Any of the following conditions must be met:<br><br>a. If the heart disease was known to have been present during employment, there must be proof that an acute exacerbation was clearly precipitated by an unusual strain by reasons of the nature of his work<br><br>b. the strain of work that brings about an acute attack must be sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical signs of a cardiac insult to constitute causal relationship<br><br>c. if a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of cardiac injury during the performance of his work and such symptoms and signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship<br><br>d. if a person is a known hypertensive or diabetic, he should show compliance with prescribed maintenance medications and doctor­ recommended lifestyle changes. The employer shall provide a workplace conducive for such compliance in accordance with Section 1(A) paragraph 5<br><br>e. in a patient not known to have hypertension or diabetes, as indicated on his last PEME<br></blockquote>Petitioner, known to be hypertensive, was required under Section 32- A(11)(d) to prove that he complied with the "prescribed maintenance medications and doctor-recommended lifestyle changes." Likewise, the employer is required to "provide a workplace conducive for such compliance[.]"<br><br>In reversing the labor tribunals' rulings, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed to prove the causal connection between his heart disease and work aboard the vessel as Chief Mate. It noted that petitioner's valvular heart disease was mostly a result of poor lifestyle choices and health habits. Hence, it was not indicative of work-relatedness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals is mistaken.<br><br>Petitioner took medication to normalize his high blood pressure,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> but the working conditions and mandatory diet aboard the vessel made it difficult and nearly impossible for him to maintain a healthy lifestyle. He stressed that he and the other seafarers were served mostly high-fat, high-cholesterol, and low-fiber food aboard the vessel. Furthermore, his work as Chief Mate carried considerable stress and required him to stay up for long stretches of time, up to the early hours of the morning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Labor Arbiter Savari noted:<br><blockquote>This Office takes judicial notice that ocean going vessels are in the high seas for a considerable length of time and that the seafarers on board are not free to choose their diet as they must content with the provisions on board which are usually frozen, preserved, smoked, salted and canned meats and vegetable products as these foods are not easily perishable while fresh fruits and vegetables cannot last long in the high seas. Therefore, with this kind of diet plus the stress of the job on board if only to keep the safety of the vessel, its crew and cargoes have their toll even upon a healthy person. Seafarers have to brave storms, typhoons and high waves during the vessel's journey plus the sudden change of climate and temperature as the vessel crossed territories. These are the factors sufficient to make a person ill.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>Labor Arbiter Savari also found that petitioner, despite being hypertensive, was declared fit to work in his pre-employment medical examination. Moreover, the poor food choices in his workplace led or contributed to his heart disease:<br><blockquote>Complainant was declared fit to work prior to embarkation, hence, there is no other conclusion than that he developed or his illnesses were triggered or aggravated on board and his working conditions precipitated his unknown illnesses.<br><br>Hence, Complainant's diseases which are congestive heart failure, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, valvular heart disease are work-related or aggravated because the fats and chemicals in frozen and preserved meats congested his arteries. His stress caused peptic ulcer to the Complainant. Clearly, Complainant's illnesses are work-related/aggravated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>The National Labor Relations Commission upheld Labor Arbiter Savari's findings, thus:<br><blockquote>We agree with the Labor Arbiter's finding that complainant's current medical condition was a work-acquired illness. As correctly noted by the Labor Arbiter, complainant was subjected to several tests by the respondents prior to embarkation and was "declared fit for sea duty" thus the conclusive presumption that complainant's illness was acquired while on-board the ocean-going vessel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Magsaysay Maritime Services, et al. v. Laurel</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> emphasized that in determining the compensability of an illness, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole reason for the seafarer's illness. A reasonable connection between the disease and work undertaken already suffices:<br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that for illness to be compensable, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness suffered by the seafarer. It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals also faulted petitioner for filing his Complaint while Dr. Quetulio was still evaluating his condition.<br><br>The Court of Appeals is again mistaken.<br><br><i>Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc., et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> explained the relevant rules and period for reckoning a seafarer's permanent disability for entitlement to disability benefits:<br><blockquote>As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off from his vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within three (3) days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the duration of the treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman is on temporary total disability as he is totally unable to work. He receives his basic wage during this period until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA Standard Employment Contract and by applicable Philippine laws. If the 120 days initial period is exceeded and no such declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists. The seaman may of course also be declared fit to work at any time such declaration is justified by his medical condition.<br><br>....<br><br>As we outlined above, a <i>temporary total disability only becomes permanent when so declared by the company physician within the periods he is allowed to do so, or upon the expiration of the maximum 240-day medical treatment period without a declaration of either fitness to work or the existence of a permanent disability</i>. In the present case, while the initial 120-day treatment or temporary total disability period was exceeded, the company-designated doctor duly made a declaration well within the extended 240-day period that the petitioner was fit to work. Viewed from this perspective, both the NLRC and CA were legally correct when they refused to recognize any disability because the petitioner had already been declared fit to resume his duties. In the absence of any disability after his temporary total disability was addressed, any further discussion of permanent partial and total disability, their existence, distinctions and consequences, becomes a surplusage that serves no useful purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><i>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc., et al. v. Munar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> then summarized the rules for entitlement to disability benefits discussed in <i>Vergara</i>:<br><blockquote>In <i>Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc.</i>, this Court read the POEA-SEC in harmony with the Labor Code and the AREC in interpreting in holding that: (a) the 120 days provided under Section 20-B (3) of the POEA-SEC is the period given to the employer to determine fitness to work and when the seafarer is deemed to be in a state of total and temporary disability; (b) the 120 days of total and temporary disability may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days should the seafarer require further medical treatment; and (c) a total and temporary disability becomes permanent when so declared by the company-designated physician within 120 or 240 days, as the case may be, or upon the expiration of the said periods without a declaration of either fitness to work or permanent disability and the seafarer is still unable to resume his regular seafaring duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The records show that Dr. Quetulio recommended petitioner to undergo open-heart surgery, but respondent Global Gateway failed or refused to act on this. Dr. Quetulio first broached the possibility of open-heart surgery on March 5, 2012, about a month after petitioner's medical repatriation. The succeeding weeks led to her formally advising respondent Global Gateway of petitioner's need for open-heart surgery, yet the company failed or refused to respond to her request, despite repeated follow-ups.<br><br>The Court of Appeals faulted petitioner for filing a Complaint before Dr. Quetulio could issue a disability assessment, and declared that she had 240 days to do so since petitioner needed additional treatment and evaluation. However, with respondent Global Gateway's deafening silence over the requested operation, stretching beyond the mandated 120 days within which Dr. Quetulio could give her assessment, it cannot be said that she needed additional time to assess petitioner's condition.<br><br>The facts show that petitioner had to undergo an open-heart surgery before Dr. Quetulio could properly assess his condition and issue a disability assessment. Unfortunately, Dr. Quetulio had reached an impasse with her management of petitioner's case. Respondent Global Gateway's silence meant that she could neither issue the required disability assessment within the 120-day period nor extend the period to 240 days to further evaluate and treat petitioner.<br><br>Dr. Quetulio's failure to timely issue a disability assessment was due to respondent Global Gateway, not because petitioner impliedly refused treatment due to his supposed inclination toward an alternative treatment, as the Court of Appeals held.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, the labor tribunals did not err in giving credence to the findings of the private physician, who concluded:<br><blockquote><b>Final Diagnosis:</b> mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation.<br><br><b>Disability Claim:</b><br><br>Based on the history, Physical examinations and laboratory examination, the patient suffers from mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Medications will need to be adjusted and further laboratories be done to prevent progression of signs and symptoms. Lifestyle medication is also advised. A consult with his cardiologist is warranted to control further recurrence of symptom as well as further deterioration caused by his present condition. His persistent symptoms hinder him from sufficiently performing his work as a seaman. He is therefore given permanent disability and declared unfit for duty in whatever capacity as a seaman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote>The POEA Standard Employment Contract spells out the conditions for compensability. Here, the compensability of petitioner's condition is clear; however, instead of fulfilling its responsibilities, respondent Global Gateway delayed his treatment and raised technical procedural barriers that were clearly unwarranted.<br><br>Shipowners who avail of Filipino hands on their decks take on the obligations of their contracts. Their crew members risk their lives and spend inordinate amounts of time attending to their businesses. Here, it would have been a measure of good business practice and a show of justice for respondents to have promptly attended to the people that make their businesses possible.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>GRANTED</b>.
