Arturo T. Pineda (Atty. Pineda) and his wife Honorata, gravely in need of money to pay off their loan from one Evelyn Cheney, and impressed by the accused­-appellants' expertise in real estate deals, engaged the latter's services to sell their three (3) hectares orchard at Baliok, Toril, Davao City, covered by TCT No. T-276925, for a price of Six Million Pesos (Php6,000,000.00), payable in 24 months. On the same date, Atty. Pineda signed a Memorandum (MOA) containing the following:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><ol><li>That the VENDOR hereby sells, transfer[s] and convey[s] unto the VENDEES his heirs, assignees, and successor, in interest (sic) the afore[-]described parcel of land including all the improvements existing thereon;<br><br></li><li>That the purchase price is SIX MILLION (P6,000,000.00) PESOS to be paid in 24 months in the following manner:<br><br>1.A.

Pineda executed a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) appointing the accused-appellants as his <i>"true lawful attorney (sic)­-in-fact"</i>, authorizing the latter:<br><br><blockquote>1. To enter into any contract, subdivide and sell my parcel of land situated in Baliok, Toril, Davao City, covered by TCT T-276925 with an area of 30,000 square meters to any person either natural or juridical.<br><br>2. To execute, sign all papers, deeds and affidavits that maybe required in connection with the sale of said land.<br><br>3. To receive the payment either in cash or check with authority to encash with payee bank.</blockquote><br>Accused-appellants, deriving authority from the SPA and MOA, sold parts of the property to several buyers and collected payments but did not remit the same to Atty. Pineda. Angered, the latter sent letters to the vendees informing them (vendees) that payment should be made to him (Atty. Pineda) being the landowner.<br><br>To put an end to their dispute, the parties on December 3, 2002 executed before the barangay a document entitled <i>"Amicable Settlement"</i> wherein they agreed as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">In the maintimes (sic) that the P6 Million is not yet satisfied, Atty.

However, accused-appellants failed to comply with the agreed 60% (P1,508,126.00) of the total sales collected by them. Instead, accused-appellants remitted only the amount of P860,166.45, leaving a balance of P647,960.00. This prompted Atty.

Arturo T. Pineda embodied the agreement of the parties. It pertinently reads:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>1.

Pineda had entered into a contract of sale involving the property for the price of P6,000,000.00 to be paid in 24 months as stated therein. The MOA thereby memorialized the full agreement of the parties on the sale of the property of the complainants to the petitioner. In no wise was agency intended. Verily, the literal meaning of the MOA should control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The express terms of the MOA bound and concluded the parties thereto, and the Prosecution could not be permitted to contradict or vary the express terms of the MOA on the nature of the agreement between the parties without colliding with the parol evidence rule embodied in Section 9, Rule 130 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 9. Evidence of written agreements. — When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.<br><br>However, a party may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the written agreement if he puts in issue in his pleading:<br><br>(a) An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake, or imperfection in the written agreement;<br><br>(b) The failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto;<br><br>(c) The validity of the written agreement; or<br><br>(d) The existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors in interest after the execution of the written agreement.</blockquote><br><br>The parol evidence rule precisely forbids any addition to or contradiction of the terms of a written agreement by testimony or other extrinsic evidence purporting to show that, at or before the execution of the parties' written agreement, other or different terms were agreed upon by the parties, varying the purport of the written contract. When an agreement has been reduced to writing, the parties cannot be permitted to adduce evidence to prove alleged practices which, to all purposes, would alter the terms of the written agreement. Whatever is not found in the writing is understood to have been waived and abandoned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the lower courts erred in holding that the parties had entered into a contract of agency.<br><br>Specifically, it was grave error on the part of the CA to have lent credence to the assertion of Atty. Pineda in his complaint-affidavit (Exhibit A) that the MOA had been a simulated contract of sale, and that the parties had really intended to authorize the petitioner as an agent to sell the property. The assertion had no weight in this case. We note with curiosity that Atty. Pineda did not present himself as a witness to identify and confirm his complaint-affidavit, and be examined thereon if the objective was hold out the contents of the complaint-affidavit as evidence against the accused. Thus, the Prosecution could not even formally offer Exhibit A as evidence under the belief that the petitioner had admitted its authenticity and due execution during the pre-trial. Contrary to the insistence to that effect by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the pre-trial order dated February 19, 2007 precisely excluded Exhibit A from the documentary exhibits then admitted by the petitioner, as the following excerpt from the pre-trial order indicated, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The genuineness and due execution of prosecution, Exh. "A" to "JJ", <b>only Exhs. "B", "F", "G" to "FF", "GG", "HH", "II" and "JJ" are admitted by the accused through counsel.</b> That of accused Exhs. "1" to "4" and submarkings, only Exhs. "1" and "3" are admitted by the prosecution through counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Bold underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>We stress the irrefutable fact that the complaint-affidavit remained as hearsay evidence in view of Atty. Pineda not having testified on its execution, and not having been examined on the contents thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, the complaint-affidavit was inadmissible,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and thus had no evidentiary worth.<br><br>In further ruling that the agreement of the parties was agency, the CA relied on the following testimony of the petitioner, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Q: You bought the property of the complainant and yet you intend to sell the same?<br><br>A: No, because the mode of payment is 24 months and the 24 months payments which we agree (sic) that we have to sell his property in terms which the memorandum of agreement coupled with the SPA (sic). We are not agent (sic) but we are buyers of the same property.<br><br>Q: Ok. Having brought the complainant's property, why do you have to sell the same?<br><br>A: Yes, because we are in the space of the row lot partitioning (sic), we are in this kind of business, we agree that we have to sell it in 24 months installment, so we pay him in 24 months installment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The CA's reliance was unfounded. By the contract of agency, a person binds himself to render some service or to do something in representation or on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the latter. Inasmuch as the basis of agency is representation, there must be, on the part of the principal, an actual intention to appoint, an intention naturally inferable from the principal's words or actions. In the same manner, there must be an intention on the part of the agent to accept the appointment and act upon it. Absent such mutual intent, there is generally no agency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Contrary to the findings of the CA, the conduct of both parties did not manifest an intent to create an agency relationship. We find nothing in the records except the bare allegations of Atty. Pineda to show that the petitioner was merely acting in the complainants' behalf.<br><br>Had the MOA been incapable of expressing the intent of the parties, Atty. Pineda could have easily sought the reformation of the express terms thereof. But the terms and expressions contained therein were couched in simple terms easily understandable and capable of no other possible and reasonable interpretation than what were written therein. At any rate, Atty. Pineda, being a lawyer, was presumed to know the law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and should not have agreed to the MOA in its present text.<br><br>Neither did the concurrent execution of the special power of attorney (SPA) and the MOA necessarily negate the contract of sale between the parties. The stipulation in the MOA on the SPA did not prove that the parties' relationship was one of agency. To begin with, the execution of the SPA was among the terms specifically stipulated in the MOA. Conformably with the <i>Civil Code</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> if some stipulation of any contract should admit of several meanings, the stipulation should be understood as bearing that import that is most adequate to render the contract effectual. Instead of proving an agency relationship, however, the stipulation that Atty. Pineda as the vendor should execute the SPA in favor of the petitioner evinced the intention of the parties that title would not be vested in the vendee until the full payment of the purchase price. Such intention was consistent with the sale, for the transfer of the title upon full payment of the consideration made the sale conditional, which did not change the nature of the transaction as a sale. We should remind that in a conditional sale, as in a contract to sell, the ownership remains with the vendor and does not pass to the vendee until full payment of the purchase price. The full payment of the purchase price partakes of a suspensive condition, and non-fulfillment of the condition prevents the obligation to sell from arising.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Another error on the part of the lower courts rested in their holding that the contract lacked consideration. Such was unfounded considering that the MOA expressly stated the purchase price of P6,000,000.00. In this regard, the petitioner admittedly complied with the terms of payment as set forth in the MOA, including partial payments made to Evelyn Cheney on behalf of Atty. Pineda. The error was due to the probable confusion in the minds of the lower courts about failure to pay the consideration, on the one hand, and lack of consideration, on the other. The two were not the same. The former resulted in a right to demand the fulfilment or the cancellation of the obligation under an existing valid contract, but the latter prevented the coming into existence of a valid contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The crime of <i>estafa</i> with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence as defined in Article 315, par., 1 (b) of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i> is committed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(b) By misappropriating or converting to the prejudice of another, money, goods, or any other personal property received by the offender in trust or on commission or for administration, or under any obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond; or by denying having received such money, goods, or other property.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br><br>The crime requires the following elements to concur, namely: (1) receipt of items in trust or under an obligation to return them or the proceeds of an authorized transaction; (2) misappropriation, conversion for personal benefit or denial of such receipt; (3) entrustor or owner was prejudiced; and (4) demand was made by the offended party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>With the transaction entered into by the parties being a sale, the petitioner as the vendee did not receive the property subject of the sale in trust or under an obligation to return: The parties' agreement to transfer the title upon payment of the purchase price rather placed the petitioner in the position of an owner and made him liable to the transferor as a debtor for the agreed price; he was not merely an agent who must account for the proceeds of a resale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The failure on the part of the petitioner to pay the consideration in full only resulted to the complainants being unpaid vendors. The former did not thereby incur criminal liability for <i>estafa</i>, for, as earlier explained, the right of the complainants as unpaid vendors was only to demand the fulfilment or the cancellation of the obligation.<br><br>Moreover, the essence of this kind of <i>estafa</i> is the appropriation or conversion of money or property received to the prejudice of the entity to whom the return thereof should be made. The words "convert" and "misappropriate" connote the act of using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or of devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon. To misappropriate for one's own use includes not only conversion to one's personal advantage, but also every attempt to dispose of the property of another without right. In proving the element of conversion or misappropriation, a legal presumption of misappropriation arises when the accused fails to deliver the proceeds of the sale or to return the items to be sold and fails to give an account of their whereabouts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Yet, the Prosecution notably did not establish the element of misappropriation or conversion because the ownership of the property subject of the sale had been meanwhile transferred to the petitioner as vendee. In this kind of <i>estafa</i>, the fraud which the law considers as criminal is the act of misappropriation or conversion. Consequently, when the element of misappropriation or conversion was missing, or was not established, there could be no <i>estafa</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The settled rule is that conviction can be handed down only if every element of the crime was alleged and proved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Under the circumstances, the acquittal of the petitioner should necessarily follow on the ground that the obligation did not entail any trust as to the proceeds, and on the ground of the dearth of evidence to support the accusation. The State did not discharge its burden of proof if the evidence did not meet the test of moral certainty required for conviction. Thus, we must uphold the presumption of innocence in the petitioner's favor and acquit him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, the petitioner was not entirely free from any civil liability where, as here, the facts established so warranted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is undisputed that the parties entered into an amicable settlement on December 3, 2002, under which they agreed that the petitioner should remit to Atty. Pineda 60% of the total sales, or P1,508,126.40, but the former remitted only P860,166.45, leaving unpaid the balance of P647,960.00.
