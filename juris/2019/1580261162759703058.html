				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Evidence seized as a result of an illegal warrantless arrest cannot be used against an accused pursuant to Article III, Section 3(2) of the Constitution. Even if the seizure was reasonable, the arresting officers' unjustified noncompliance with the legal safeguards under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 compromises the integrity of the confiscated drug. This creates reasonable doubt on the conviction of the accused for illegal possession of dangerous drugs.<br><br>This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the Decision2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> convicting Joseph Villasana y Cabahug (Villasana) of illegal possession of dangerous drugs.

He alleged the following:<br><br>At around 7:00 p.m. on January 4, 2005, while PO3 Martinez was on duty at the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Unit of the Valenzuela City Police Station, a confidential informant arrived and reported that Jojo Villasana and Nida Villasana were rampantly selling drugs along Hustisya Street, Marulas, Valenzuela City. Thus, a team headed by Police Inspector Muammar A. Mukaram (Inspector Mukaram) with SPO1 Arquillo, PO3 Soriano, PO3 Britana, PO2 Sanchez, PO3 Martinez, PO2 Magno, PO2 Malinao, PO2 Salvidar, and PO1 Pajares as members, was at once formed to conduct surveillance operations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At about 11:30 p.m. that day, the team proceeded to the target area on board three (3) vehicles: a car, a Revo van, and a motorcycle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> PO3 Martinez, PO3 Soriano, and PO2 Magno parked on Hustisya Street and waited inside the van.

Accordingly, the said accused is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months as maximum.

He argued that the trial court gravely erred: (1) in finding the evidence admissible despite the illegality of his arrest; (2) in finding him guilty despite the police officers' failure to comply with Article II, Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165; (3) in giving full credence to the prosecution witness' testimony; and (4) in convicting him despite the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In its March 11, 2013 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision <i>in toto:</i><br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>in view of the foregoing premises, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED </b>and the October 28, 2010 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 171 in Valenzuela City in Criminal Case No. 16-V-05 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED <i>in toto.</i></b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals held that there was a valid warrantless arrest because Villasana "was caught <i>inflagrante delicto </i>of having in his possession an illegal drug."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It also found that the police officers had probable cause to apprehend Villasana, as he matched the description given by the informant, and was also found at the place specified by the informant. It further noted that when they apprehended him, they found in his possession a sachet containing white crystalline substance, which turned out to be shabu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In any case, the Court of Appeals held that Villasana was already estopped from questioning the legality of his arrest since he failed to move for the quashing of the Information before his arraignment. Neither did he raise the issue of his warrantless arrest prior to or during the proceedings before the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals gave no merit to Villasana's claim on noncompliance with the guidelines on custody and disposition of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It gave credence to PO3 Martinez's testimony, in which he stated that after confiscating the sachet containing the illegal drug, he marked it with "JCV,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and along with PO2 Sanchez and PO2 Magno, brought it to the Marulas Barangay Hall where it was inventoried in the presence of Villasana, Kagawad Mendez, and the other barangay tanods, and later to the Crime Laboratory for examination. The Court of Appeals held that, absent any showing of ill motive on the part of the police officers, the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duty applied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals further held that procedural infirmities in the custody of dangerous drugs are insufficient to render the seized items inadmissible in court as evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> so long as their integrity was shown to be preserved, as in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Villasana filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but it was denied in the Court of Appeals' August 28, 2013 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> was filed.

Also, even if there was no waiver of the issue, respondent claims that petitioner's arrest was valid as he was caught <i>in flagrante delicto </i>possessing shabu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Respondent adds that noncompliance with the requirements of Section 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> did not render the seizure of the dangerous drug void since the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item were preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Finally, it contends that the chain of custody of the seized specimen—from inventory until submission to the Crime Laboratory—was already stipulated upon and is considered a judicial admission on the part of petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>This Court resolves the following issues:<br><br>First, whether or not factual issues can be raised in a Rule 45 petition; and<br><br>Second, whether or not the guilt of petitioner Joseph Villasana y Cabahug was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>This Court grants the Petition.

Thus, the ensuing seizure of the shabu purportedly in his possession is unlawful, and the seized drug is, therefore, inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>Under the 1987 Constitution, all citizens are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, houses, papers, and effects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> As a rule, a search and seizure must be carried out with a search warrant validly issued by a judge upon personal determination of probable cause;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> otherwise, the search becomes unreasonable. It follows that any item or article obtained from such search cannot be used as evidence for any purpose in any proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence, however, has recognized several exceptions to the search warrant requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Among these exceptions is a search incidental to a lawful arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In this instance, the lawful arrest must precede the search; the process cannot be reversed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>A lawful arrest may be effected with or without a warrant. The instances of lawful arrest without warrant are provided in Rule 113, Section 5 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 5. <i>Arrest Without Warrant; When Lawful. </i>— A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br><blockquote>(a) <i>When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;</i><br><br>(b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Section 5(a) refers to an <i>in flagrante delicto </i>arrest, and requires compliance with the "overt act test," as explained in <i>People </i>v. <i>Cogaed:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[F]or a warrantless arrest of in flagrante delicto to be affected, "two elements must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he [or she] has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Section 5(b), on the other hand, requires that at the time of the arrest, an offense had just been committed and the arresting officer had personal knowledge of the facts indicating that the accused had committed it.<br><br>In both instances, the police officer must have personal knowledge of the commission of an offense. Under Section 5(a), the officer himself or herself witnesses the crime; in Section 5(b), the officer knows that a crime has just been committed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and had witnessed some facts that led him or her to believe that the person about to be arrested committed the offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>On several occasions, this Court has invalidated<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> warrantless arrests and ensuing searches and seizures for the arresting officers' failure to comply with the overt act test, or for their lack of personal knowledge that a crime has just been committed by the accused.<br><br>In <i>Comerciante </i>v. <i>People,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> this Court ruled that the warrantless arrest was not lawful because the arresting officers failed to determine beforehand that a criminal activity was ongoing. It remarked that it was highly implausible that the police officer would be able to identify—especially around 10 meters away and while aboard a motorcycle cruising at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour—minuscule amounts (0.15 gram and 0.28 gram) of white crystalline substance inside two (2) very small plastic sachets held by the accused. This Court further held that merely <i>"standing around with a companion and handing over something to the latter cannot in any way be considered criminal acts."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>Sindac </i>v. <i>People,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> this Court held that considering that the arresting officer was five (5) to ten (10) meters away from when a man allegedly handed the accused a plastic sachet containing suspected shabu, it was highly doubtful that the officer was able to reasonably ascertain that a crime was being committed. It held:<br><br><blockquote>Considering that PO3 Peñamora was at a considerable distance away from the alleged criminal transaction (five [5] to ten [10] meters), not to mention the atomity of the object thereof (0.04 gram of white crystalline substance contained in a plastic sachet), the Court finds it highly doubtful that said arresting officer was able to reasonably ascertain that any criminal activity was afoot so as to prompt him to conduct a lawful <i>in flagrante delicto </i>arrest and, thereupon, a warrantless search. These similar circumstances were availing in the cases of <i>Comerciante v. People </i>and <i>People v. Villareal </i>where the Court likewise invalidated the <i>in flagrante delcito (sic) </i>arrest and ensuing warrantless search. In this relation, it should also be pointed out that no criminal overt act could be properly attributed to Sindac so as to rouse any reasonable suspicion in the mind of either PO3 Penamora or PO1 Asis that Sindac had just committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. <i>Sindac's actuations of talking to and later on, receiving an unidentified object from Canon, without more, should not be considered as ongoing criminal activity </i>that would render proper an <i>in flagrante delicto </i>arrest under Section 5 (a), Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>In this case, PO3 Martinez was about six (6) to ten (10) meters away when he saw petitioner emerge from an alley, talking to a woman while holding a plastic sachet. His testimony fails to state that he had personal knowledge that the sachet contained shabu, or that he saw the sachet containing white crystalline substance, to create a reasonable suspicion that the sachet did indeed contain shabu. From all indications—the time of the arrest being 11:30 p.m., PO3 Martinez's location, and the tinted front windshield of the van through which he was looking—it was highly doubtful that PO3 Martinez saw, let alone deciphered, the contents of the sachet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> For sure, it was only when he held petitioner's hand<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> and confiscated the plastic sachet that he was able to verify its contents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>What appears from PO3 Martinez's narration of facts is that petitioner was arrested: (1) because of the informant's tip that he was selling drugs;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and (2) because he was known to PO2 Magno and PO2 Sanchez.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>It is settled that "reliable information" provided by police assets alone is not sufficient to justify a warrantless arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> There must be independent circumstances perceivable by the arresting officers suggesting that a criminal offense is being committed to comply with the exacting requirements of Rule 113, Section 5 of the Rules of Court. An accused must perform some overt act within plain view of the police officers indicating that she or "he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> None was present in this case.<br><br>With petitioner's arrest being illegal, the subsequent seizure of the shabu allegedly in his possession becomes "unreasonable." At this point, it must be emphasized that petitioner's failure to question his arrest before he made his plea only affects the jurisdiction of the court over his person<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and does not bar him from raising the inadmissibility of the illegally seized shabu. A waiver of an illegal warrantless arrest does not carry with it a waiver of the inadmissibility of the evidence obtained during the illegal arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Because the dangerous drug was unlawfully seized, it cannot be used as evidence against petitioner. Without the dangerous drug, petitioner's acquittal based on reasonable doubt is inevitable.<br><br><div align="center"><b>III</b><br></div><br>Likewise, petitioner's imputation of irregularities in the custody and the police officers' handling of the seized shabu is well taken. From the facts on record, the police officers had compromised the integrity of the shabu purportedly seized from him.<br><br>The <i>corpus delicti </i>in the prosecution for illegal possession of dangerous drugs consists in the dangerous drug itself, without which no conviction of the accused can be obtained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> It is indispensable for the State to establish the identity of the dangerous drugs, the integrity of which must have been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> This requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs seized from the accused and subsequently examined in the laboratory are the same drugs presented in court as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Toward this end, each link in the chain of custody of the seized drug must be accounted for<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> to show that there was no "tampering, alteration[,] or substitution either by accident or otherwise."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>In <i>Mallillin, Jr. v. People,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> this Court expounded on the rationale behind the exacting requirements of Republic Act No. 9165 in prosecutions for illegal possession of dangerous drugs:<br><br><blockquote>Indeed, <i>the likelihood of tampering, loss or mistake with respect to an exhibit is greatest when the exhibit is small and is one that has physical characteristics fungible in nature and similar inform to substances familiar to people in their daily lives. Graham vs. State </i>positively acknowledged this danger. In that case where a substance later analyzed as heroin — was handled by two police officers prior to examination who however did not testify in court on the condition and whereabouts of the exhibit at the time it was in their possession — was excluded from the prosecution evidence, the court pointing out that the white powder seized could have been indeed heroin or it could have been sugar or baking powder. It ruled that unless the state can show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into the possession of police officers until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition, testimony of the state as to the laboratory's findings is inadmissible.<br><br><i>A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature. </i>The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility, that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases — by accident or otherwise — in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. Hence, in authenticating the same, <i>a standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, </i>a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The first and crucial stage in the chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs and other related items immediately upon confiscation from the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> In <i>People </i>v. <i>Gonzales,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> this Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>The first stage in the chain of custody is the marking of the dangerous drugs or related items. <i>Marking, which is the affixing on the dangerous drugs or related items by the apprehending officer or the poseur- buyer of his initials or signature or other identifying signs, should be made in the presence of the apprehended violator immediately upon arrest. </i>The importance of the prompt marking cannot be denied, because succeeding handlers of the dangerous drugs or related items will use the marking as reference. Also, the marking operates to set apart as evidence the dangerous drugs or related items from other material from the moment they are confiscated until they are disposed of at the close of the criminal proceedings, thereby forestalling switching, planting, or contamination of evidence. <i>In short, the marking immediately upon confiscation or recovery of the dangerous drugs or related items is indispensable in the preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Here, PO3 Martinez stated during trial that he marked the seized sachet with accused-appellant's initials "JCV" in the "office." But the office—whether in the Marulas Barangay Hall where Villasana was supposedly first brought, or in the Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Unit—remained unclear from his testimony. In any case, it is manifest that the seized drugs were not immediately marked upon seizure, and the records do not show why it was not done at the earliest possible opportunity.<br><br>More importantly, there is no clear showing that the marking had been done in the presence of petitioner or his representative.

This is due to the variance in what was stated in these documents—the Request for Laboratory Examination referred to <i>"One small plastic evidence bag marked as SAID-SOU/VCPS 04-12-05 containing one (1) pc small plastic sachet . . . marked as 'JCV'";</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Physical Science Report No. D-006-05 referred to <i>"One (1) self-sealing transparent plastic bag with markings 'SAID-SOU/VCPS 04-01-05' containing 0.15 gram of white crystalline substance and marked as A-1"</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The discrepancies in the markings create doubt as to whether the specimen allegedly seized from petitioner and submitted to the Crime Laboratory was the same one examined by Inspector Arturo, and subsequently presented in court.<br><br>Furthermore, there was noncompliance with the legal requirements under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165.
