As already mentioned, this Court denied the Petition for failure to show any reversible error in the challenged Decision and Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Hence, petitioner filed this Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It urges this Court "to re-study the judicial nuance"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

Alternatively, it requests that the case be referred to the En Banc, if necessary, for its resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioner insists that its claims are timely. It argues that, although the claims were filed beyond the 120+30-day periods under Section 112 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Tax Code), they were nonetheless filed within the two (2)-year period under Section 229 of the same law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It contends that the timing was in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 7-95, which establishes that appeals before the Court of Tax Appeals may be made after the 120-day period and before the lapse of the two (2)-year period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that noncompliance with the 120+30-day periods is not a jurisdictional defect, but only a case of a "lack of cause of action,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which may be subject to the equitable principle of waiver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Moreover, since respondent admitted in the consolidated cases that the Petitions were filed within the allowable period, she cannot claim otherwise. Consequently, the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc erred when it still passed upon the issue of the appeals' timeliness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further asserts that the window created in <i>San Roque Power Corporation</i> by BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, which excludes from the 120+30-day periods prematurely filed judicial claims from December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010-when <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i> was promulgated-should also extend to claims belatedly filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It reasons that taxpayers were misled by respondent's pronouncement in the BIR Ruling that they had the full two (2)-year period to file their Petitions before the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Even so, it contends that <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i> and <i>San Roque Power Corporation</i> cannot be applied retroactively, as doing so will impair petitioner's substantive rights and deprive it of its right to a refund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This Court denies the Motion for Reconsideration for its lack of substantial argument to warrant a reversal of the Minute Resolution.<br><br>The issue on the timeliness of respondent's filing of judicial claim is anchored on the nature of the prescriptive periods under Section 112 of the Tax Code:<br><blockquote>SECTION 112. Refunds or Tax Credits of Input Tax. -<br><br>....<br><br>(D) Period within which Refund or Tax Credit of Input Taxes shall be Made. - In proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund or issue the tax credit certificate for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) hereof.<br><br>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund or tax credit, or the failure on the part of the Commissioner to act on the application within the period prescribed above, <i>the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days.from the receipt of the decision denying the claim or after the expiration of the one hundred twenty day-period, appeal the decision or the unacted claim with the Court of Tax Appeals</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>A plain reading of this provision reveals that a taxpayer may appeal the Commissioner's denial or inaction only within 30 days when the decision that denies the claim is received, or when the 120-day period given to the Commissioner to decide on the claim expires.<br><br>In <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> this Court applied the plain text of the law and declared that the observance of the 120+30-day periods is crucial in filing an appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals. This Court also declared that, following <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mirant Pagbilao Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> claims for refund or tax credit of excess input tax are governed not by Section 229, but by Section 112 of the Tax Code.<br><br>These doctrines were reiterated in <i>San Roque Power Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> where this Court stressed that Section 112, in providing the 120+30 day periods to appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals, "must be applied exactly as worded since it is clear, plain, and unequivocal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's claim that it filed its judicial claims under Revenue Regulation No. 7-95, which supposedly allowed claims for refund filed after the 120-day period but before the lapse of the two (2)-year period, is untenable.<br><br>First, petitioner's judicial claims were filed on April 20, 2006 and December 27, 2006;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> hence, they were governed by the Tax Code, which clearly provided: (1) 120 days for the Commissioner to act on a taxpayer's claim; and (2) 30 days for the taxpayer to appeal either from the Commissioner's decision or from the expiration of the 120-day period in case of the Commissioner's inaction.<br><br>Moreover, Revenue Regulation No. 16-2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> not Revenue Regulation No. 7-95, was the prevailing rule when petitioner filed its judicial claims. Its Section 4.112-1 faithfully reflected Section 112 of the Tax Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 9337:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4.112-1. Claims for Refund/Tax Credit Certificate of Input Tax. -<br><br>....<br><br>(d) Period within which refund or tax credit certificate/refund of input taxes shall be made<br><br>In proper cases, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall grant a tax credit certificate/refund for creditable input taxes within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with subparagraph (a) above.<br><br>In case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax credit certificate/refund as decided by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the taxpayer may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) within thirty (30) days from the receipt of said denial, otherwise the decision shall become final. However, <i>if no action on the claim for tax credit certificate/refund has been taken by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue after the one hundred twenty (120) day period from the date of submission of the application with complete documents, the taxpayer may appeal to the CTA within 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is misleading for petitioner to raise its supposed reliance in good faith on Revenue Regulation No. 7-95, when the rule had already been superseded and revoked by the time it filed its judicial claims.<br><br>Second, under Section 112 of the Tax Code, only the administrative claim for refund of input value-added tax must be filed within the two (2)-year prescriptive period, the judicial claim need not be.<br><br>Section 112(A) states that:<br><blockquote>(A) Zero-rated or Effectively Zero-rated Sales. - Any VAT ­ registered person, whose sales are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated may, <i>within two (2) years</i> after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made, <i>apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund</i> of creditable input tax due or paid attributable to such sales[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i> and <i>San Roque Power Corporation</i>, the phrase "within two (2) years ... apply for the issuance of a tax credit certificate or refund" refers to administrative claims for refund or credit filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, not to appeals made before the Court of Tax Appeals.<br><br>This is apparent in Section 112(D), Paragraph 1 of the Tax Code, which gives the Commissioner [120] days from the date of submission of complete documents in support of the application filed in accordance with Subsections (A) and (B) within which he or she can decide on the claim. On the other hand, Section 112(D), Paragraph 2 provides a 30-day period within which one may appeal a judicial claim before the Court of Tax Appeals.<br><br>Reading together Subsections (A) and (D), <i>San Roque Power Corporation</i> declared that the 30-day period does not have to fall within the two (2)-year prescriptive period, as long as the administrative claim is filed within the two (2)-year prescriptive period.<br><br>Third, the right to appeal before the Court of Tax Appeals, being a statutory right, can be invoked only under the requisites provided by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> or the Court of Tax Appeals Charter, provides a 30-day period of appeal either from receipt of the Commissioner's adverse decision or from the lapse of the period fixed by law for action. Thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <i>Who May Appeal; Mode of Appeal; Effect of Appeal</i>. - Any party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ... may <i>file an appeal with the CTA within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such decision or ruling or after the expiration of the period fixed by law for action</i> as referred to in Section 7(a)(2) herein.<br><br>(B) Appeal shall be made by filing a petition for review under a procedure analogous to that provided for under Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure with the CTA <i>within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision or ruling or in the case of inaction as herein provided, from the expiration of the period fixed by law to act thereon</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In turn, Section 7(a)(2) of the Court of Tax Appeals Charter, as amended, reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. - The CTA shall exercise:<br><br> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify">....</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(A) </div></td><td><div align="justify">(2) <em>Inaction by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving</em> disputed assessments, <em>refunds of internal revenue taxes</em>, fees or other charges, penalties in relations thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, <em>where the National Internal Revenue Code provides a specific period of action, in which case the inaction shall be deemed a <strong>denial</strong></em>[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Under the Court of Tax Appeals Charter, the Commissioner's inaction on a claim for refund is considered a "denial" of the claim, which may be appealed before the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days from the expiration of the period fixed by law for action.<br><br>Here, since petitioner filed its judicial claims way beyond the 30-day period to appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals lost its jurisdiction over the Petitions. This Court has held that "[j]urisdiction over the subject matter is fundamental for a court to act on a given controversy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Moreover, it "cannot be waived ... and is not dependent on the consent or objection or the acts or omissions"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of any or both parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Contrary to petitioner's stance, the Court of Tax Appeals is not precluded to pass on this issue <i>motu proprio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> regardless of any purported stipulation made by the parties.<br><br>Further, this Court is not convinced by petitioner's claim that BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 should cover both prematurely and belatedly filed claims for tax refund. The query interposed by the One Stop Shop Inter­ Agency Tax Credit and Duty Drawback Center - Department of Finance in BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> specifically pertained to the process in cases where a taxpayer did not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 expressly states that the "taxpayer-claimant need not wait for the lapse of the 120-day period before it could seek judicial relief with the [Court of Tax Appeals] by way of Petition for Review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Consequently, San Roque Power Corporation recognized the BIR Ruling, being a general interpretative rule, as an exception to the strict construction of any claim for tax exemption or refund on equitable estoppel.<br><br>There is nothing in the same BIR Ruling that states, expressly or impliedly, that late filings of judicial claims are acceptable.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership filed its claim 138 days after the lapse of the 30-day period. This Court held that while BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was in effect when it filed its claim, the rule nonetheless cannot be properly invoked because it contemplates <i>premature</i> filing, not <i>late</i> filing. This Court further emphasized that late filing, or beyond the 30-day period, is absolutely prohibited, even when BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03 was in force.<br><br>Likewise, this Court rejects petitioner's claim that <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i> and <i>San Roque Power Corporation</i> should be applied prospectively because it would be unjust to the other claimants who relied on the old rule, under which both administrative and judicial claims should be filed before the lapse of the two (2)-year period.<br><br>Interpretations of law made by courts "necessarily always have a retroactive effect."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This Court, in construing the law, merely declares what a particular provision has always meant. It does not create new legal obligations.<br><br>In <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.</i>, this Court first squarely addressed the issue on prematurity of a judicial claim based on its interpretation of the language of the Tax Code. In that case, this Court did not defer application of the doctrine laid down. Rather, it ordered the Court of Tax Appeals to dismiss Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.'s appeal as it prematurely filed its claim for refund/credit of input value-added tax. <i>Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.'s</i> claim was filed prior to this case.<br><br><i>San Roque Power Corporation</i> dealt with judicial claims that were either prematurely filed or already prescribed. In one (1) of the consolidated cases, G.R. No. 197156, the taxpayer, Philex Mining Corporation (Philex), filed its judicial claim beyond the 30-day period to appeal as in this case. This Court rejected the judicial claim of Philex due to late filing, explaining that:<br><blockquote>Unlike San Roque and Taganito, Philex's case is not one of premature filing but of late filing. Philex did not file any petition with the CTA within the 120-day period. Philex did not also file any petition with the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 120-day period. Philex filed its judicial claim <i>long after</i> the expiration of the 120-day period, in fact 426 days after the lapse of the 120-day period. <i>In any event, whether governed by jurisprudence before, during, or after the Atlas case, Philex's judicial claim will have to be rejected because of late filing.</i> Whether the two-year prescriptive period is counted from the date of payment of the output VAT following the <i>Atlas</i> doctrine, or from the close of the taxable quarter when the sales attributable to the input VAT were made following the <i>Mirant</i> and <i>Aichi</i> doctrines, Philex's judicial claim was indisputably filed late.<br><br>The <i>Atlas</i> doctrine cannot save Philex from the late filing of its judicial claim. The <i>inaction</i> of the Commissioner on Philex's claim during the 120-day period is, by express provision of law, "deemed a denial" of Philex's claim. Philex had 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period to file its judicial claim with the CTA. Philex's failure to do so rendered the "deemed a denial" decision of the Commissioner final and inappealable. The right to appeal to the CTA from a decision or "deemed a denial" decision of the Commissioner is merely a statutory privilege, not a constitutional right. The exercise of such statutory privilege requires strict compliance with the conditions attached by the statute for its exercise. Philex failed to comply with the statutory conditions and must thus bear the consequences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Since then, the 120+30-day periods have been applied to pending cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> resulting in the denial of taxpayers' claims due to late filing. This Court finds no reason to make an exception here.<br><br>A claim for unutilized input value-added tax is in the nature of a tax exemption. Thus, strict adherence to the conditions prescribed by the law is required of the taxpayer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Refunds need to be proven and their application raised in the right manner as required by law.
