and his brother, Avelino Morales, attended the birthday celebration of their nephew, Bienvenido Morales, Jr., at the latter's shop at G. Araneta Avenue, Meralco Site, Brgy. Dona Imelda, Quezon City. Avelino Morales and Manuel Morales, together with Bienvenido Morales, the celebrator's father, and accused-appellant Bernie Raguro, had a drinking spree. In the course thereof, accused-appellant Bernie Raguro, who was already drunk, hurled invectives at Avelino Morales, Manuel Morales and Bienvenido Morales. Avelino Morales got angry and asked accused-appellant Bernie Raguro to leave the house.<br><br>Around 7:00 P.M., the rain started to pour, prompting the group to transfer to Marietta Ofalla's house located across the street. Thereafter, accused-appellant Bernie Raguro came back with accused-appellants Eric Raguro, Teodulo Panti, Jr. and Elmer Dimakiling, who were all armed with bladed weapons. They called on Avelino Morales to come. When Avelino Morales came out from the house, accused-appellant Bernie Raguro stabbed him on the lower left side of his chest.&nbsp; Accused-­appellants Eric Raguro and Teodulo Panti, Jr. also stabbed Avelino Morales, while accused Elmer Dimakiling, who was coming from behind Avelino Morales, stabbed Avelino Morales on the clavicle.&nbsp; Avelino Morales fell to the ground and vomited blood. Avelino Morales' fourteen year old son, Arvin Morales, witnessed the incident as he was behind Avelino Morales during the incident. Marietta Ofalla also witnessed the incident, as she was about only two (2) arms length away from them.<br><br>After stabbing Avelino Morales, accused-appellant Bernie Raguro turned to Manuel Morales and stabbed him. Manuel Morales was also stabbed at the back by two (2) other persons, whom he identified as accused Elmer Dimakiling and one Juvel Beredo. On the other hand, accused-appellant Jonathan Perez appeared from behind with a 2x2 piece of wood and hit Avelino Morales at the back and Manuel Morales on his right buttocks. Marietta Ofalla, shouted for help which prompted all of accused-appellants to run away.<br><br>Avelino Morales and Manuel Morales were both rushed to Delos Santos Hospital.&nbsp; Avelino Morales died on that fateful night due to multiple stab wounds on his trunk. Manuel Morales, on the other hand, sustained two (2) fatal stab wounds at the back and was admitted at the same hospital where he underwent surgery.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Upon arraignment on September 18, 2002, accused-appellants Bernie Raguro and Jonathan Perez entered their respective pleas of "<b>not guilty</b>." After pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>On November 5, 2002, an information was filed charging accused-­appellants Eric Raguro, Teodulo Panti, Jr., Levie de Mesa and Jonathan Perez and accused Elmer Dimakiling with <i>Frustrated Murder</i>. Thus:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Accused-appellant Eric Raguro was arraigned on May 4, 2004 while accused-appellants Teodulo Panti, Jr., Levie de Mesa and Jonathan Perez were arraigned on February 21, 2005.

The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated September 24, 2013 of the trail court is <b>AFFIRMED</b>, subject to the modification that (i) in <i>Criminal Cases Nos. Q-02-111754</i> and <i>Q-04-128398</i>, the award [for] civil indemnity is decreased to P50,000.00 in each case, and the award of exemplary damages is increased to P30,000.00 in each case, and, (ii) in <i>Criminal Cases Nos.

Their group attack against Avelino and Manuel reflected one continuous criminal design to kill attended by abuse of superior strength. Each of them was competently shown to have performed specific overt acts that showed actual participation in the assault. Hence, even if Eric was not shown to have inflicted any specific fatal injury on Manuel, he was nonetheless liable for frustrated murder on the basis of conspiracy considering that it was sufficiently established that he had himself taken an active part in attacking Avelino with his bladed weapon. That part was enough to demonstrate that he had conspired with the attackers of Avelino and Manuel.<br><br>In <i>People v. Natividad</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> we discoursed as follows:<br><blockquote>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. To establish conspiracy, direct evidence is not required. It is not even essential that there be proof of the agreement to commit the felony. Proof of concerted action of the accused before, during and after the crime which demonstrates their unity of design and objective is sufficient. This Court had consistently ruled that conspiracy may be inferred when by their acts, two or more persons proceed towards the accomplishment of the same felonious objective, with each doing his act, so that their acts though seemingly independent were in fact connected, showing a closeness of former association and concurrence of sentiment. To hold one as a co­ principal by reason of conspiracy, it must be shown that he performed an overt act in pursuance of or in furtherance of the conspiracy, although the acts performed might have been distinct and separate. This overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the time of the commission of the crime, or by exerting a moral ascendance over the other co-conspirators by moving them to execute or implement the criminal plan. Once conspiracy is established, all the conspirators are answerable as co-principals regardless of their degree of participation, for in the contemplation of the law, the act of one becomes the act of all. It matters not who among the accused inflicted the fatal blow to the victim.<br></blockquote>As such, once the CA properly affirmed the RTC's findings, such findings generally become conclusive and binding upon this Court, and should remain undisturbed unless there were compelling and exceptional reasons to do so. No such reasons were presented herein by the accused-appellants concerned.<br><br>As to accused-appellant de Mesa, the CA observed as follows:<br><blockquote>It would appear that by the acts of the herein accused, none of them did any overt act to prevent or dissociate themselves form the others and by their acts it is apparent that they agree to commit the felony and as such, they are liable for the death of AVELINO and injury of MANUEL. Indeed, mere presence at the scene of the incident by itself, is not a sufficient ground to hold a person liable as a conspirator. However, conspiracy may be inferred from proof of facts and circumstances which when taken together indicate that they are part of the scheme to commit the crime. <b>Although MANUEL testified that ERIC did not hurt him or that no overt act was attributed to LEVIE who was also present at the time of the felony, their overt acts of keeping themselves around served no other purpose than to lend moral support by ensuring that no one could give succor to the victims. Their presence at the scene has no doubt encouraged their co-accused and increased the odds against the victim. One who participates in the material execution of the crime by standing guard or lending moral support to the actual perpetuation thereof is criminally responsible to the same extent as the actual perpetrator.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>In our view, the CA erred in affirming the conviction of de Mesa. His incrimination as a co-conspirator was based on pure speculation and conjecture. There was no proof adduced to show that he had at least lent moral support to his co-accused-appellants when they attacked Avelino and Manuel. Conspiracy could not be deduced from his being merely present at the scene of the crime. He must be shown at least to have committed an overt act that indicated his concurrence in the common criminal design to kill their victims that had animated the attack by the others. Such overt act by de Mesa, to be sufficient to implicate him as a co-conspirator, must be beyond a merely preparatory act.<br><br>The character of the <i>overt act</i> is well explained in <i>People v. Lizada</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>An overt or external act is defined as some physical activity or deed, indicating the intention to commit a particular crime, more than a mere planning or preparation, which if carried out to its complete termination following its natural course, without being frustrated by external obstacles nor by the spontaneous desistance of the perpetrator, will logically and necessarily ripen into a concrete offense. <b>The <i>raison d'etre</i> for the law requiring a direct overt act is that, in a majority of cases, the conduct of the accused consisting merely of acts of preparation has never ceased to be equivocal; and this is necessarily so, irrespective of his declared intent. It is that quality of being equivocal that must be lacking before the act becomes one which may be said to be a commencement of the commission of the crime, or an overt act or before any fragment of the crime itself has been committed, and this is so for the reason that so long as the equivocal quality remains, no one can say with certainty what the intent of the accused is.</b> It is necessary that the overt act should have been the ultimate step towards the consummation of the design. It is sufficient if it was the "first or some subsequent step in a direct movement towards the commission of the offense after the preparations are made." <b>The act done need not constitute the last proximate one for completion. It is necessary, however, that the attempt must have a causal relation to the intended crime. In the words of Viada, the overt acts must have an immediate and necessary relation to the offense.</b> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>In view of the absence of any factual or legal basis to implicate de Mesa in the conspiracy to assault Avelino and Manuel, the Court acquits him for failure of the Prosecution to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Nonetheless, we modify the civil liability of the remaining accused­-appellants to make the awards conform with the pronouncement in <i>People v. Jugueta</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> For the murder of Avelino Morales, the civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages to be granted to his heirs are each increased to P75,000.00. The Court further grants the amount of P50,000.00 as temperate damages in lieu of compensatory damages for funeral expenses. For the injuries suffered by Manuel Morales, the moral and exemplary damages are each increased to P50,000.00. In addition, Morales is granted P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.
