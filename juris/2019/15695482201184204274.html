				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> are the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 20, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 08194-MIN which partially set aside the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated January 31, 2017 and the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated April 28, 2017 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC No. MAC-10-014668-2016 granting, among others, in favor of petitioner Rey Ben P. Madrio (petitioner) the amount of P84,150.00 representing separation benefits pursuant to respondent Atlas Fertilizer Corporation's (AFC) retirement/separation policy.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Petitioner was formerly the Area Sales Manager of AFC from May 1, 2008 until he tendered his resignation in November 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which, however, was not shown to have been approved by the company. At that time, he also requested for the payment of several monetary benefits,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> but the same remained unheeded.<br><br>Feeling aggrieved, petitioner, on January 5, 2016, filed a complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against AFC for the payment of several monetary benefits. Among others, petitioner claimed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that he was entitled to separation benefits in the amount of P158,400.00<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> pursuant to AFC's retirement/separation policy. As proof, petitioner attached an <u><b>unsigned and unauthenticated typewritten copy of the Retirement Plan</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and Policy on Separation from Employment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to his position paper, as well as copies of his pay slips<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to show his monthly pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For its part,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> AFC categorically denied that the Retirement Plan is the retirement/separation policy it had for its employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In any event, it argued that it would be unreasonable for it to pay separation benefits to an employee who was solely responsible in causing the company a whopping financial loss of P43,023,550.21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> attributed to his gross negligence in the handling of uncollected receivables from Richfield Agri-Supply (RAS). In this regard, AFC averred that the disciplinary proceeding for petitioner's gross negligence was only deferred out of humane considerations and in light of petitioner's years of service. It further stressed that petitioner was given the chance to redeem himself by assisting AFC to recover said amount from the defaulting customer, <i>i.e.</i>, RAS, but he just unceremoniously left the company without obtaining any clearance or permission from the management.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>The LA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated August 26, 2016, the LA ruled in favor of petitioner, and accordingly, ordered AFC to pay him the total amount of P273,200.00 representing his monetary claims, inclusive of separation benefits in the amount of P158,400.00. AFC was likewise ordered to issue petitioner's Certificate of Employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The LA held that petitioner's entitlement to separation benefits, among others, was already admitted by AFC itself as evinced by the tenor of its <b>March 20, 2016 reply-letter</b> received during conciliation proceedings. Considering that AFC introduced the reply-letter as its own evidence, and without qualification, it was estopped from assailing the contents thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In this relation, the LA further pointed out that AFC, as the employer, had complete control over all the records of its employees. As such, it had the burden to prove payment or settlement when there was an allegation of nonÂ­payment of monetary claims. However, since AFC failed to do so, the claims are deemed admitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, AFC appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the NLRC.<br><br>Among others, AFC argued that the LA's award of separation benefits was unwarranted as nothing in the March 20, 2016 reply-letter could be construed as automatically warranting petitioner's entitlement to the same. All it indicated was that petitioner's possible benefits were being processed. AFC also reiterated its objection to the admissibility of the unsigned and unauthenticated Retirement Plan submitted by petitioner. Moreover, even assuming the admissibility of the same, petitioner was still not entitled to separation pay since he did not meet the minimum age requirement and had a derogatory record, <i>i.e.</i>, the P43,023,550.22 loss that the company incurred for his gross negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b>The NLRC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated January 31, 2017, the NLRC affirmed with modification the LA's ruling by reducing the amount of the separation benefits from P158,400.00 to P84,150.00, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The NLRC held that contrary to AFC's arguments, it already tacitly admitted petitioner's entitlement to separation benefits based on its March 20, 2016 reply-letter received during conciliation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Furthermore, while petitioner was not eligible for normal or optional retirement benefits, he was entitled to separation benefits under Section 4, Article IV of the Retirement Plan which covers an employee who "voluntarily resigns from the Company without any derogatory record[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, the amount should be corrected to reflect the correct monthly salary exclusive of overtime pay, commissions, per diems, and other special remuneration, pursuant to the said Plan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, AFC sought partial reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which the NLRC denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated April 28, 2017. Thus, it filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> before the CA, raising only the twin issues of whether or not the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in admitting the unsigned and unauthenticated Retirement Plan, and declaring that petitioner was not disqualified from receiving his separation benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated June 20, 2018, the CA partially set aside the NLRC ruling insofar as the award of separation benefits to petitioner was concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>According to the CA, the NLRC erred in considering the Retirement Plan as evidence to support petitioner's claim for separation benefits. Being unsigned and unauthenticated, there was no way to verify the truth of its contents, and thus, it should have been rejected as evidence. In this regard, the CA held that while the NLRC is not bound by technical rules of procedure, the evidence presented must at least have a modicum of admissibility for it to have probative value, which was not the case here.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Consequently, it ruled that petitioner was not entitled to separation benefits under AFC's Retirement Plan given that there was no substantial evidence to prove the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the NLRC gravely abused its discretion when it admitted the Retirement Plan as evidence, and consequently, granted the award of separation benefits in favor of petitioner.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>At the outset, the Court stresses that in a Rule 45 review of labor cases, the Court only examines the correctness of the CA's decision in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> "In ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was presented to the CA. Hence, the Court has to examine the CA Decision from the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC Decision."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>For decisions of the NLRC, there is grave abuse of discretion "when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and accordingly, dismiss the petition."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In holding that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion, the CA found that it erroneously considered in evidence the unsigned and unauthenticated Retirement Plan for petitioner's claim of separation benefits. Considering that the said document should not have been admitted, the CA set aside the NLRC's award of separation benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the result reached by the CA.<br><br>It is well-settled that administrative and quasi-judicial bodies, like the NLRC, are not bound by the technical rules of procedure in the adjudication of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> However, when it comes to admitting documents as evidence in labor cases, it is nonetheless required that there be some proof of authenticity or reliability as condition for the admission of documents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In <i>IBM Philippines, Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which was cited by the CA, the Court held that:<br><blockquote>The computer print-outs, which constitute the only evidence of petitioners, afford no assurance of their authenticity because they are unsigned. The decisions of this Court, while adhering to a liberal view in the conduct of proceedings before administrative agencies, have nonetheless <u><b>consistently required some proof of authenticity or reliability as condition for the admission of documents</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Contrary to the CA's holding, the circumstances of this case show that there is actually <i>some proof of authenticity or reliability</i> that the copy of the Retirement Plan attached to petitioner's position paper reflects AFC's retirement/separation policy. This is because: (<i>a</i>) AFC never denied having an existing company policy wherein separation benefits are given to its qualified employees; (<i>b</i>) AFC, which is presumed to have custody of the relevant documents covering its company policies, never submitted the "true" copy of its Retirement Plan despite being given the opportunity to do so; and (<i>c</i>) as petitioner pointed out, the "eight (8)-page [<u>copy of the Retirement Plan</u>] is too technical, verbose and comprehensive to be simply attributed as a fake."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Hence, these circumstances lend "some proof of authenticity or reliability" to the document presented by petitioner, and as such, the NLRC did not err in lending credence to the same.<br><br>Nevertheless, this does not mean that petitioner is automatically entitled to the claimed separation benefits. Proving the existence of AFC's retirement/separation policy, as well as its pertinent terms and conditions, is separate and distinct matter from proving the fact that these terms and conditions have been complied with.<br><br>To be sure, the separation benefits under the AFC's company policy is not the separation pay contemplated under the labor code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> but rather, a special benefit given by the company only to upstanding employees who have satisfied the following conditions:<br><ol><li>The employee must voluntarily resign from the company;<br><br></li><li><u><b>The employee must not have a derogatory record</b></u>; and<br><br></li><li>The employee must meet the minimum number of years in his credited service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></li></ol>In light of these special conditions, it is fairly apparent that the separation benefits under the Retirement Plan are not in the nature of benefits incurred in the normal course of AFC's business, such as salary differentials, service incentive leave pay, or holiday pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As such, the burden is on the <b>employee</b> to prove his entitlement thereto;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> failing m which, the latter should not be paid the same.<br><br>In this case, petitioner only submitted a copy of the Retirement Plan as proof of his entitlement to the separation benefits claimed. However, by and of itself, the said document only proves what the retirement/separation policy of AFC is. It does not, in any way, demonstrate that the conditions for entitlement had already been met by the employee.<br><br>Most glaring of all is the failure of petitioner to at least, <i>prima facie</i> show that he had no derogatory record before voluntarily resigning from the company. As indicated in AFC's March 20, 2016 reply-letter, AFC was still dealing with the P43,023,550.21 financial loss from the RAS account based on petitioner's alleged gross negligence at the time he abruptly "resigned" from the company.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> While the records do not show that petitioner was disciplined for such infraction, AFC claims that "[d]ue to [petitioner's] unceremonious resignation, [it] was no longer able to conduct disciplinary proceedings and/or administrative hearings in relation to [petitioner's] nonÂ­feasance. It might even [be] safe to say that [petitioner] resigned just to preÂ­empt [AFC] from instituting disciplinary proceedings against him."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As such, it cannot be said that petitioner has no derogatory record with the company. Hence, unless proven otherwise, petitioner is not qualified to claim separation benefits from AFC.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner's claim for separation benefits appears to be premature. It is undisputed that petitioner left the company while his separation benefits were still being processed and yet to be approved by the Retirement Committee<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> pursuant to the "company's normal operating procedure."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This is clear from the March 20, 2016 reply-letter which - contrary to the findings of the labor tribunals - was not an admission of liability but, quite the contrary, an assertion that petitioner's claim for separation benefits was still subject to a contingency, <i>i.e.</i>, the approval by the Retirement Committee, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In any case, please be informed that based on records since your turn over or handover report were late (records were only turned over to personnel department/PMIRD around last week of January 2016) the processing of your clearance and also your <b>separation benefit computation</b> in our accounting department <b>is still being processed</b>.<br><br>A documented and written handover report is a requirement in our company policy for clearance. You are aware of this policy. Your delayed submission of the said requirement have also contributed to the delay of your <b>separation pay</b>. This could have been avoided had you coordinated much earlier to your immediate superior regarding all your clearance requirements.<br><br>In any case, this is <b>now under process</b> and PMIRD is trying its best to fast track the routing of your <u><b>separation benefit sheet which needs to be approved by the retirement committee</b></u>. <u><b>This is part of the company's normal operating procedure.</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, the Court is unconvinced that petitioner has proven his entitlement to the separation benefits under AFC's company policy. As such, the CA Decision is affirmed insofar as it set aside the NLRC's award of separation benefits in favor of petitioner not for the reasons given by the CA but based on the above discussion.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision dated June 20, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08194-MIN is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>.
