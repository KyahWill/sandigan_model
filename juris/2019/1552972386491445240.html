Immediately, PO1 Forastero grabbed Calotes and confiscated a plastic sachet from him while SPO1 Madriaga apprehended petitioner from whom he recovered two (2) more plastic sachets. They then proceeded to the SAID-SOTF headquarters in Muntinlupa City,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> where PO1 Forastero and SPO1 Madriaga marked the seized plastic sachets, and conducted an inventory thereof in the presence of Nestor T.

Although they admitted being at the PNR site at the time and date alleged by the arresting officers, they, however, denied engaging in any illegal activity and instead, averred that petitioner was merely paying off his debt to Calotes when the police apprehended them. They maintained that the police recovered nothing from them when they were bodily searched. Nonetheless, they were brought to the police station, made to undergo a drug test, and charged with violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated March 13, 2014, the RTC found petitioner and Calotes guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 and sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for twelve (12) years and one (1) day as. minimum to fourteen (14) years as maximum and to pay a fine in the amount of P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Citing Section 5 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, the RTC found that the warrantless arrest of petitioner and Calotes was valid, and as such, the plastic sachets seized from them were admissible in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Further, the RTC held that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the crime charged, and the arresting officers - pursuant to Section 21 (a) of RA 9165. and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) - took the necessary steps to preserve the integrity of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Aggrieved, petitioner and Calotes appealed to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated April 15, 2016, the CA denied petitioner and Calotes' appeal and affirmed their conviction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> sustaining the RTC's finding that all the elements of the crime charged had been established by the prosecution. It likewise upheld the validity of their warrantless arrest, and further found that the integrity of the seized items had been preserved as the chain of custody thereof had been observed despite their marking at the police station. Likewise, the· specimens were brought to the crime laboratory and examined on the same date.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioner and Calotes moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated December 9, 2016; hence, this petition filed only by petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld petitioner's conviction for the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> renders the. evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs. are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires that the apprehending team, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, "a representative from the media <u><i>AND</i></u> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, "[a]n elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <u><i>OR</i></u> the media."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As such, deviations from the procedure may be allowed, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<i>a</i>) there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, the Court takes this opportunity to clarify that compliance with the chain of custody rule is not a mere technical rule of procedure that courts may, in their discretion, opt to relax. In the first place, the chain of custody procedure is embodied in statutory provisions which were "crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses [in drugs cases], especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It is not a Supreme Court - issued rule of procedure created under its constitutional authority to "[p]romulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts." Rather, it is an administrative protocol that law enforcement officers and operatives are enjoined to implement as part of their police functions. Indeed, while the chain of custody rule is "procedural" in the sense that it sets a step-by-step process that must be followed, it is <i>by no means remedial in nature</i> since it is not, properly speaking, a requirement or process that pertains to court litigation.<br><br>At most, insofar as an actual court proceeding is concerned, it is the compliance with the chain of custody procedure, or the presence of justifiable reasons for non-compliance, which must be proved; in this relation, it is the <i>procedure of proving the same</i> which is prescribed in the ordinary rules of evidence, which is, on the other hand, what our courts have discretion over. Thus, when a court finds that non-compliance with the chain of custody rule is allowable, it does not exercise its discretion to relax a Court-issued rule; rather, it determines that the prosecution was able to prove that: (<i>a</i>) there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In so doing, the court only applies the saving - clause found in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>It deserves pointing out that the mandatory nature of the chain of custody rule traces its roots to, as earlier stated, the peculiarity of drugs cases in that the seized drugs constitute the "body of the crime." The chain of custody rule is the administrative mechanism established by legislature to ensure an acceptable level of certainty with respect to the drugs' integrity and evidentiary value. Hence, failure to comply or failure to justify non­compliance means that this level of certainty has not been satisfied, and as a result, conjures reasonable doubt on an indispensable element of the crime. This is the reason why the law states "non-compliance with the requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items," which inversely stated, effectively means that the seizure and custody over the items are rendered void and invalid by the non-compliance with these requirements, unless the non-compliance is under justifiable grounds, and that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. Overall, it may therefore be said that the foundational bearings of the chain of custody rule, owing to the peculiar treatment of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in drugs cases, hearken to the accused's presumption of innocence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and thus, flesh out safeguards therefor. It is this signification that firmly confirms the nature of the chain of custody rule as a matter of substantive law, and not a mere technical rule of court procedure.<br><br>In this case, petitioner is charged with Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs. However, records disclose glaring and unjustifiable deviations from the chain of custody procedure, as follows:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, prosecution witnesses PO1 Forastero<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and SPO1 Madriaga<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> both testified that they were in possession of the plastic sachets confiscated from petitioner and Calotes, with SPO1 Madriaga keeping in his possession the two (2) plastic sachets seized from petitioner. They likewise testified<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> that they marked the seized items in the police station and after a request for laboratory examination had been prepared, both of them went to the PNP Crime Laboratory to deliver the said request and the seized items.<br><br>Unfortunately, PO1 Forastero and SPO1 Madriaga failed to identify <i>who</i> received the request for laboratory examination and the seized items at the crime laboratory. Records show that before the specimens were handled by and subjected to qualitative examination by P/Insp. Bonifacio, the forensic chemist, the items were received by a certain "Relos," as clearly reflected on the lower left hand portion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of the request for laboratory examination. Neither has it been established who handled the same before and after P/Insp. Bonifacio rendered her findings until the same had been presented in court as evidence for purposes of identification.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, although the arresting officers prepared a Certificate of Inventory at the police station immediately after the arrest, the records are bereft of evidence showing that 1the seized items were photographed, much more in the presence of petitioner, or his representative or counsel, as well as the witnesses required by law.<br><br><b><i>And finally</i></b>, there was also a deviation from the witness requirement as the conduct of inventory was not witnessed by an <i>elected</i> public official, a DOJ representative, and a media representative. This may be gleaned from the Certificate of Inventory which shows that the same was witnessed only by City Architect Gianan, who is not considered as an <i>elected</i> public official. This fact is further confirmed by SPO1 Madriaga, who testified that:<br><blockquote>[Atty. Balbaguio]: Did you conduct an inventory, Mr. Witness?<br><br>[SPO1 Madriaga]: Yes, ma'am<br><br>Q: Who were present?<br><br>A: The accused, the witness and other operatives.<br><br>Q: There was no elected official present?<br><br>A: None, ma'am.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[Fiscal Baybay]: What about the inventory[,] why did you not have it signed by a barangay official or elected official?<br><br>[SPO1 Madriaga]: No available official at that time only the city architect of the City Government of Muntinlupa.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>As earlier stated, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to account for these witnesses' absence by presenting a justifiable reason therefor or, at the very least, by showing that genuine and sufficient efforts were exerted by the apprehending officers to secure their presence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> As the Court sees it, the prosecution did not faithfully comply with these standards and unfortunately, failed to justify non-compliance. As such, the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs have been compromised, which perforce warrants petitioner's acquittal.<br><br>As a final note, it must be pointed out that although petitioner's co-accused, Calotes, no longer joined in filing the instant petition, the Court nevertheless deems it proper to likewise acquit him of the crime charged. This is because the criminal case against Calotes arose from the same set of facts as the case against petitioner and that such acquittal is definitely favorable and beneficial to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Section 11 (a), Rule 122 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure states that:<br><blockquote>Section II. <i>Effect Of appeal by any of several accused</i>. -<br><br>(a) An appeal taken by one or more of several accused shall not affect those who did not appeal, <b>except insofar as the judgment of the appellate court is favorable and applicable to the latter</b>.

Nevertheless, it is well­ settled that "[a]dministrative regulations enacted by administrative agencies to implement and interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce have the force of law and are entitled to respect. Such rules and regulations partake of the nature of a statute and are just as binding as if they have been written in the statute itself" (<i>ABAKADA Guro Party List v. Purisima</i>, 584 Phil. 246, 283 [2008]). As it now stands, however, the saving-clause has been crystallized into statutory law when it was adopted into the text of RA 9165 pursuant to its amendment by RA 10640.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><br></sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Section 14 (2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution states:<br><blockquote>Section 14. x x x<br><br>(2) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy, impartial, and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in his behalf.
