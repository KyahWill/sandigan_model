CIO-ALU is among the complainants in three (3) cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against SCMCI for unpaid wage increases, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, differential pay, holiday pay, and separation pay. All three cases were eventually decided in favor of the SCMCI workers. The controversy before the Court arose during the consolidated proceedings for the execution of the aforesaid judgments. It all started from the Notice of Levy dated February 9, 2006 issued by Sheriff Enrique Y. Paredes (Sheriff Paredes), advising the authorized representative or agents of SCMCI that he has to attach properties found inside the premises of SCMCI, more particularly described as follows: </p><ol><li> Forty-five (45) trailers;</li><li> Mill Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises);</li><li> Fabrication and Boiling House Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises);</li><li>Electrical and Power House Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises); </li><li>Scrap Payloader, Bulldozers and two (2) Dump Trucks; </li><li>Scattered Mill Rollers and other scrap materials found within the compound of SCMCI; and </li><li>Machine Shop Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></li></ol> <p> Thereafter, Sheriff Paredes issued a "Notice of Sale on Execution of Some Properties" mentioned in the Notice of Levy.

MBTC claimed a superior right over the properties to be levied since it has long acquired said properties m a foreclosure sale being the highest bidder. </p><p> On February 20, 2006, Executive Labor Arbiter Danilo C.

ELA Acosta granted the Urgent Motion for Reconsideration in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated July 4, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the July 2006 Acosta Order), ratiocinating that the NLRC Fourth Division had previously rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated February 2, 2005 dismissing an appeal filed by MBTC as third-party claimant in one of the three antecedent cases.

The NLRC ruled that the Appraisal Report should not be the basis for determining how much was taken to satisfy the judgment award. It further held that "what determines whether the judgment award has been fully satisfied is the amount actually paid to the complainants" (<em>i.e.</em>, CIO-ALU). </p><p> CIO-ALU, then, filed a motion to implement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the October 2006 NLRC Resolution before the NLRC RAB No. VI in Iloilo City.</p><p> In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated November 13, 2006, ELA Acosta directed Sheriff Paredes to implement the writs of execution against SCMCI. He, likewise, issued a break open order so that the Sheriff can take possession of items not belonging to MBTC.</p><p> Sheriff Paredes resumed the execution of the judgment award and took the properties covered by the Certificate of Sale issued to MBTC. To protect its rights and interests, MBTC instituted a complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> for reconveyance and recovery of personal properties with damages against CIO-ALU and Sheriff Paredes, whieh was docketed as Civil Case No. RTC-963 and raffled to Branch 59 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. The RTC, then, issued an Order dated January 22, 2007 enjoining CIO-ALU and the Sheriff of the NLRC from conducting further execution on all the properties located in the SCMCI compound/plant, effective upon MBTC's filing of a bond in the sum of P500,000.00 in addition to the bond posted by CIO-ALU in the amount of P500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> On January 23, 2007, MBTC filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> with the CA, assailing the September 2006 and October 2006 NLRC Resolutions. Later, MBTC filed a Supplemental Petition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> substantially alleging that the NLRC issued yet another Resolution dated November 29, 2007 holding that it is still premature for ELA Acosta to declare that the judgment award is fully satisfied. According to MBTC, the October 2006 NLRC resolution erroneously held that the satisfaction of the judgment award can only be determined by the actual distribution of the total proceeds of the auction sale to CIO-ALU and the workers it represents. MBTC, likewise, contended that the NLRC erred in ordering the continued execution of other properties of MBTC without taking into account the Sheriff’s Report declaring that the judgment award due to CIO-ALU and the workers it represents had already been fully satisfied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> MBTC moved for a partial reconsideration of the Resolution dated November 29, 2007, but the same was denied by the NLRC in its Resolution of January 29, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated April 8, 2011, the RTC dismissed MBTC's petition for reconveyance. MBTC sought reconsideration, but was denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated June 2, 2011. </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the CA</b> </p><p>On April 23, 2012, the CA rendered the assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> in favor of MBTC, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, the petition for certiorari and prohibition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b> for being meritorious. Accordingly, the Court sets aside the Resolutions of the NLRC dated September 21, 2006 and October 31, 2006 and reinstates the August 15, 2006 Decision of the NLRC. Further, the Court directs the NLRC Sheriff, the NLRC, or any of its deputies, officers, or agents and all other persons acting under its instructions from further executing other properties of MBTC whether real or personal found inside the premises of [SCMCI].</p> <p> <strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The CA resolved two basic issues, namely, whether or not the NLRC erred: 1) in ordering the levy of the properties in question; and 2) in not recognizing Sheriff Paredes' report stating that the judgment awards have been fully satisfied.</p><p> Regarding the issue of the propriety of the levy, the CA. ruled that CIO-ALU can no longer levy on the properties in dispute, on the basis of the following factual findings and conclusions: 1) that MBTC has become the owner of all the buildings, improvements, machinery, and equipment erected on the SCMCI compound, by virtue of the Certificate of Sale awarded to MBTC after the foreclosure of SCMCI's mortgage trust indenture; 2) that the August 2006 NLRC Decision upholding MBTC's third-party claim had become final and executory, hence, CIO-ALU can no longer dispute the existence of MBTC's third-party claim; and 3) that the monetary award in the three cases amounting to P12,690,057.00, excluding execution fees, has already been satisfied by prior auction sales conducted by the NLRC Sheriff, a fact which is confirmed by the October 2006 Acosta Order. </p><p> On the issue of the full satisfaction of the judgments, the CA disagreed with the NLRC's ruling that the judgments can only be considered fully satisfied upon actual distribution to the CIO-ALU members of the total proceeds of the auction sales. The appellate court was of the opinion that the actual distribution of the funds is not the function of the NLRC but of its Sheriff; and in the absence of sufficient evidence to prove that CIO-ALU was prevented from taking possession of the properties subject of the successful auction sales, greater weight must be accorded to the finding in the October 2006 Acosta Order that the judgments have already been fully satisfied. </p><p> CIO-ALU filed a motion for reconsideration, which the appellate court denied in the assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated September 26, 2012; hence, the present petition which raises the following issues: </p><ol><li> THE HONORABLE CA GRAVELY ABUSED ITS JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN GRANTING AND DECLARING THE MBTC'S PETITION FOR CERTIORARI AND PROHIBITION TO BE MERITORIOUS NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADMISSIONS OF THE MBTC WHICH REFUTE THE MBTC'S THIRD- PARTY CLAIM; and <br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE CA GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY RELYING ON TECHNICALITIES AND DISREGARDING SUBSTANTIVE LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></li></ol> <p> CIO-ALU contends that MBTC's third-party claim has no merit, for two reasons: 1) it is contrary to certain admissions made by MBTC in its pleadings to the effect that it is not claiming all the properties which may be found in the premises of SCMCI; and 2) the RTC already denied MBTC's petition for reconveyance which raises in issue the very same matter involved in the execution proceedings,<em> i.e</em>., the ownership of the properties subject of the execution. CIO-ALU, likewise, faults the CA for granting MBTC's petition on the basis of technicalities and without resolving the question of what constitutes full satisfaction of the judgment awards in the case at bar. </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> The petition should be dismissed. </p><p>Prefatorily, it must be noted that while the petition filed by CIO-ALU with the Court was denominated as a "Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em>" presumably under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, its contents betray its actual nature as a petition for <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 65. The caption of the petition reads: "<em>For: CERTIORARI under <u>Rule 65</u> of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure</em>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The Prefatory Statement of the petition opens, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> This is a Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> under <u>Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 65</u> of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure to annul and/or set aside the DECISION of the Honorable Court of Appeals' FORMER SPECIAL EIGHTEENTH DIVISION promulgated on April 23, 2012 x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Underscoring Ours) .</p> </blockquote> <p> More tellingly, the issues raised by the petition as quoted above, allege grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA in rendering the assailed decision and resolution. However, <em>certiorari</em> is not the proper remedy from a decision of the CA in a labor proceeding. The process of reviewing decisions of the labor tribunals has been settled with clarity in the leading case of <em>St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> where the Court held that review of NLRC decisions must be made before the CA by petition for <em>certiorari </em>under Rule 65; and then before this Court by petition for review under Rule 45,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> for the special civil action of <em>certiorari </em>is a distinct remedy from, and not a substitute for, appeal by<em> certiorari </em>under Rule 45.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Even if We exercise our judicial discretion and consider the petition as one for review on <em>certiorari </em>under Rule 45, We would still be constrained to deny the petition for being filed out of time. CIO-ALU received the assailed CA resolution on October 18, 2012;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> thus, it had 15 days<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> from that date, or until November 2, 2012, to file the petition. However, the petition was filed only on December 28, 2012 - almost two months after the reglementary period under the Rules of Court had lapsed. </p><p> While the petition is dismissible on this point alone, the Court, nevertheless, discusses the substantive aspects of the case in order to render complete justice to the parties. The issues raised by CIO-ALU essentially involve the question of whether or not further levies may be made on the properties located at the SCMCI's premises.</p><p> The resolution of this issue is complicated by the existence of two rulings on MBTC's third-party claim: the August 2006 NLRC Decision granting such claim, and the 2011 RTC decision which dismissed it. The August 2006 NLRC Decision pertains to the properties enumerated in the third-party claim brought by MBTC in the execution proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> On the other hand, the issue resolved in the RTC decision is "whether the machineries, equipment and other materials levied upon and sold on public auction by the NLRC Sheriff, as enumerated in the Certificate of Sale dated July 17, 2006, are included in the Certificate of Sale in favor of [MBTC] arising from the Mortgage Trust Indenture." A perusal of the two decisions shows that they both involve the same properties, <em>viz</em>.: </p><ol><li> Forty-five (45) trailers; </li><li>Mill Dept. (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises); </li><li> Fabrication and Boiling House Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises); </li><li> Electrical and Power House Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises); </li><li>Scrap Payloader, Bulldozers and two (2) Dump Trucks; </li><li> Scattered Mill Rollers and other scrap materials found within the compound of [SCMCI]; and </li><li> Machine Shop Department (including all accessories and other scrap materials found inside the premises).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></li></ol> <p> In ruling for MBTC, the August 2006 NLRC Decision simply held that MBTC was able to establish ownership of the above-listed properties by virtue of the December 1, 1999 certificate of sale. On the other hand, the RTC decision rendered in 2011 held that MBTC failed to discharge the burden of proving that the above-listed properties were included in the properties itemized in MBTC's 1999 Certificate of Sale. MBTC sought recourse with the trial court after the rendition of the September 2006 and October 2006 NLRC Resolutions which had the ultimate effect of furnishing basis for the continued execution against the properties MBTC claims as its own.</p><p> What is clear at this point is that MBTC is indeed the owner of all the properties listed in the December 1, 1999 certificate of sale. However, as ruled by the NLRC in its September 2006 Resolution, MBTC's ownership of properties located within the premises of SCMCI extends only to such listed properties and the accessories thereto; but not to <em>all </em>properties which may be found in the said premises. It follows, therefore, that any property of SCMCI not acquired by MBTC in the foreclosure sale may still be levied upon. Nevertheless, the evidence on record strongly indicates that there is no more need for further levies on execution at this point. Noteworthy is the fact that CIO-ALU's petition contains no allegation regarding the amount of the remaining deficiency in the judgment which would necessitate further levy. On the other hand, in the course of the proceedings before the RTC, it was proven that a Certificate of Sale dated July 17, 2006 had been issued to CIO-ALU as the sole and highest bidder in an auction sale conducted by Sheriff Paredes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Furthermore, the LA and the CA both agree that there have been enough properties levied to satisfy the judgment. As the CA observed: </p><blockquote> <p> It is worth stressing that the monetary award due the private respondents reached an aggregate amount of P12,690,057.00 excluding the execution fees. In the implementation of the writs, the NLRC sheriff had already conducted several auction sales, one of which was evidenced by a <b><u>Contract of Sale dated July 17, 2006 wherein private respondent CIO-ALU was awarded as the highest bidder of certain equipment or machineries such as trailers, payloaders, etc. found inside the premises of SCMCI valued at P6,575,610.00</u></b>. Subsequent auction sales were conducted until the Sheriff made a report that the monetary judgment has already been satisfied. In fact, no less than the Executive Labor Arbiter Acosta has confirmed that there was full satisfaction of the judgment award. This can be gleaned from his Order dated October 16, 2006 x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)</p> </blockquote> <p> ELA Acosta's confirmation of the satisfaction of the judgment awards is based primarily on the October 4, 2006 <em>Ex-Parte </em>Manifestation filed by MBTC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which states that Sheriff Paredes had already taken properties appraised at P24 Million during levies conducted in July and September 2006; the October 5, 2006 Sheriff's Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> submitted by Sheriff Paredes, which is a return on the writs of execution in the three (3) consolidated cases filed by CIO-ALU and the SCMCI workers; and the Supplemental Sheriffs Report dated October 11, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> whereby Sheriff Paredes adopted the findings of the appraisal reports submitted by MBTC together with its<em> Ex-Parte</em> Manifestation. Taken together, these pieces of evidence constitute sufficient proof that Sheriff Paredes has levied enough property to satisfy the judgment debt. It is, therefore, clear that there is no need for further levies in this case. </p><p> Nevertheless, a completed levy does not automatically mean that the judgment has already been satisfied. It has been held that mere levy on property of sufficient value to cover the judgment award does not operate as a satisfaction of the judgment, but merely as a <em>prima facie</em> evidence or a presumption of satisfaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Under the Rules of Court, which applies suppletorily to the NLRC Execution Manual,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> a levy only creates a lien over the property in favor of the judgment obligee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In order to afford full satisfaction of the judgment from the levied property, an execution sale must be conducted,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and the proceeds therefrom be used to satisfy the judgment debt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Therefore, a money judgment is satisfied only upon payment of the judgment award<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> or the issuance of a certificate of sale in favor of the judgment creditor after the conduct of an execution sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> In the case at bar, the CA gravely erred in concluding that the judgments have been fully satisfied. The evidence relied upon by ELA Acosta and the appellate court,<i> i.e</i>., MBTC's <em>Ex-Parte</em> Manifestation and the two Reports submitted by Sheriff Paredes, only establishes that there is enough property already levied for the satisfaction of the judgment. However, there is no evidence on record which would indicate that these properties have already been sold and the proceeds thereof distributed to the SCMCI workers in full satisfaction of the judgment. Based on the writs of execution, the total amount due under the three judgments is P12,650,058.83.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> However, the July 17, 2006 Certificate of Sale is only in the amount of P6,575,610.00, leaving a balance of P6,074,448.83. The CA decision mentions "subsequent auction sales" made after the issuance of the July 17, 2006 Certificate of Sale, but does not cite any particular evidence to support such an assertion. </p><p> However, this erroneous conclusion of the appellate court cannot inure to the benefit of CIO-ALU, for it has been established by the record that the judgment in its favor has been fully satisfied by virtue of the July 17, 2006 Certificate of Sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The amount stated in the said Certificate of Sale (P6,575,610.00) far exceeds the amount awarded to CIO-ALU by virtue of the judgment in RAB Case No. 06-11-10805-97 (P4,955,130.18).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> At this point, the Court reiterates the fact that this petition stemmed from three separate cases against SCMCI which were consolidated only at the execution stage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> However, the prevailing parties in the two other cases, namely, Wilfredo Senador, <em>et al.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and Placido Alcano, <em>et al.</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> did not join CIO-ALU in filing the present petition before this Court; hence, in the absence of proof that they authorized CIO-ALU to bring the present petition in their behalf, the binding effect of this decision can only extend to CIO-ALU, whose judgment has already been satisfied and over whom the NLRC and this Court, perforce, no longer have jurisdiction. Therefore, the proper party to invoke the non-satisfaction of the two other judgments are the complainants who obtained those judgments, Wilfredo Senador,<em> et al</em>. and Placido Alcano, <em>et al</em>., who, unfortunately, did not come before this Court to vindicate their rightful claims. Stated differently, by their failure to appeal therefrom, the CA decision had become final and binding as against them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is hereby <strong>DISMISSED</strong>.
