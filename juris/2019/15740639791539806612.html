In Criminal Case No. 140190, the RTC also convicted Estong and Michelle Bautista y Dela Cruz (Bautista) of violating Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 (RA 7610), otherwise known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act." </p><p> In Criminal Case No. 140189, Estong was charged with rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353.

The Information states: </p><blockquote> <p> On or about May 17, 2009, in Pasig City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, conspiring and confederating together and both of them mutually helping and aiding each other, x x x accused Anthony Chavez y Villareal, alias Estong with lewd designs, by means of force' and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of lasciviousness upon the person of BBB, a minor, twelve (12) years old, by mashing her breast, licking her vagina and forc[ing] her to hold his penis, all against her will and consent; while accused Michelle Bautista y Dela Cruz, as accomplice, cooperated in the execution of the offense by supplying material aid in the execution of the offense in an efficacious way - that is by inviting the minor victim to the place of the accused and while performing the lascivious act upon the person of [the] minor victim, Michelle Bautista was watching; which acts are prejudicial to [the] normal growth and development of the complainant as a minor or as a human being. </p> <p>Contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Upon arraignment, Estong and Bautista entered a plea of not guilty. Trial ensued.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Version of the Prosecution</u></b> </p><p> The prosecution presented the first victim, AAA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> on the witness stand. AAA, then a fourteen (14) year old high school student testified that on 15 May 2009, while AAA was in her grandmother's house, Estong invited her to his house to watch television. BBB went inside but left after a while. After BBB left, Estong played an x-rated film. While Estong and AAA were watching the x-rated film, Estong started to remove AAA's panty. After undressing AAA, Estong then inserted his penis into AAA's vagina. AAA allegedly resisted but Estong held her two hands. According to AAA, the sexual abuse lasted for twenty-five minutes. Estong then gave AAA Twenty Pesos (P20) after the incident. AAA then went out of the house while Estong remained inside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> AAA was outside Estong's house when her father arrived. AAA's father asked AAA what she was doing there and AAA did not answer. According to AAA, she did not immediately tell her father of the alleged rape because AAA was afraid of Estong and her father. According to AAA, she only told her father about what Estong did to her when another victim, BBB, filed a complaint in the barangay against Estong. Upon learning of the incident, AAA's father brought her to Rizal Medical Center to undergo a medical examination. On cross-examination, AAA claimed that the incident on 15 May 2009 was not the first time Estong sexually abused her. AAA claimed that there were five (5) prior incidents of sexual advances against her by Estong but despite of which, she still heeded the invitation of Estong inside his house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> On 28 April 2010, BSF Edelito A. Aranda (BSF Aranda), a member of the Barangay Security Force of Pasig-City, took the witness stand. According to BSF Aranda, on 18 May 2009, he was on duty at the time BBB's mother called them to report that Estong raped BBB. Upon receiving the complaint, BSF Aranda proceeded to the house of BBB's mother. However, during that time, through the help of Bautista, Estong had already escaped. BSF Aranda then chased Estong to Maybunga where BSF Aranda arrested Estong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> On 20 October 2010, BBB, the second victim, took the witness stand. BBB, who was then fourteen (14) years old during the alleged rape, testified that on 17 May 2009 at around 8:30 in the evening, while BBB was at her neighbor's house, AAA called her. After going down to her neighbor's house, Bautista called BBB to buy ice and softdrinks. BBB then bought the items and brought the same to the house of Estong and Bautista. Bautista then closed the door and told BBB that they would just play cards. Estong, who was in the same room, then undressed BBB and caressed BBB's vagina. Estong then mashed and licked BBB's breast. According to BBB, Bautista was just watching while she was being sexually abused by Estong. The daughter of BBB's neighbor saw them and kicked the door, forcing Estong to open it. The said neighbor then requested the barangay officials to arrest Estong. According to BBB, she and AAA were friends and neighbors; BBB alleged that the sexual abuse committed to her had affected her schooling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> On 6 April 2011, Eva C. Galvez (Galvez) testified that she and, both, Estong and Bautista were living in the same house. Galvez, together with her family, was occupying the upper portion of the house, while Estong and Bautista were occupying the lower portion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Galvez testified and confirmed that she saw Estong molesting BBB and said that Bautista was in the same room watching and not doing anything. Galvez claimed that while she was resting, her daughter rushed upstairs and told her that Estong and BBB were doing something downstairs. Galvez immediately went down to verify the information and Galvez saw Estong and BBB naked. Estong was sitting on the chair while holding his penis and one of his hands was mashing the breast of BBB. Bautista was in the same room washing and slicing meat. According to Galvez, there was no indication that Bautista tried to stop or prevent Estong from molesting BBB. Galvez claimed that she heard Bautista utter the words: "patay nahuli tayo ni Ate Eva." BBB then told Galvez that she was molested by Estong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> Finally, the prosecution presented PCI Ian Virtucio. PCI Virtucio testified and confirmed the findings of the Medico-Legal Report prepared by PCI Mamerto Bernabe.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Version of the Defense</u></b> </p><p align="justify"> The defense presented Estong and Bautista. Estong denied the allegations of the prosecution. Estong claimed that AAA was just his neighbor and he did not know BBB. Estong also claimed that he was sleeping in his rented house in Pasig City during the time the alleged rape of AAA happened. Bautista also denied the allegations of the prosecution. Bautista alleged that she could not have been an accomplice because she was working as a Metro Aide, sweeping the streets, when the alleged sexual abuse against BBB was committed by Estong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Ruling of the RTC</u></b> </p><p> In a Decision dated 1 June 2016, the RTC found Estong guilty of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code.

In convicting both Estong and Bautista, the trial court found that: (1) all the elements of the crime of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 8369 and violation of Section 5(b) of RA 7610 are present; (2) the testimonies of AAA and BBB are credible because they were convincingly delivered in a straightforward manner; (3) the testimony of BBB was corroborated on material points by the testimony of prosecution witness Galvez; and (4) Estong and Bautista's defenses of denial and alibi cannot prevail because they are both weak and self-serving.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> The RTC held that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of rape and child abuse. The RTC found that Estong, through force and intimidation, had carnal knowledge of AAA, a minor, against her will. The RTC held that Estong was also guilty of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 against BBB. The RTC ruled that Bautista was guilty beyond reasonable doubt as an accomplice to the commission of the crime of sexual abuse. </p><p> The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="96%"> <div align="justify">In Criminal Case No. 140189, accused <i>Anthony Chavez y Villareal @ Estong</i>, is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape defined and penalized under Art. 266-A, par. 1 (a) of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 8353 and in further rel. to Sec. 5(a) of R.A. 8369 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.

The CA also affirmed the ruling of the RTC that both Estong and Bautista were guilty of sexual abuse. In Criminal Case No. 140189, the CA modified the award of exemplary damages by increasing it to P30,000.00 in addition to civil indemnity and moral damages of P75,000.00 each.

The Information charged Estong with having carnal knowledge of AAA, then thirteen (13) years old, without her consent by means of force or intimidation. Notably, the burden of proof rests with the prosecution to establish that Estong's carnal knowledge of AAA was accompanied by force or intimidation. In the present case, the CA affirmed the finding of the RTC that the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt that Estong exerted force or intimidation when he had carnal knowledge of AAA. </p><p> We do not agree. </p><p> In convicting Estong of the crime of rape against AAA, both the RTC and CA heavily relied on AAA's testimony and the Medico-Legal Report. A perusal of the records of the case negates the conclusion of both the RTC and CA that the carnal knowledge between Estong and AAA was accompanied by force or intimidation on the part of Estong. In AAA's testimony, she claimed that she freely and voluntarily went to Estong's house to watch television. AAA also alleged that it was not the first time she had carnal knowledge with Estong. As a matter of fact, in AAA's testimony, despite the alleged previous incidents of carnal knowledge with Estong, AAA still voluntarily went to Estong's house when she was invited to watch television, to wit: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">So were you invited by Estong, how were you able to enter the house of Estong?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><strong>A:</strong></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Tinawag niya po ako, dahil nandoon po ako sa bahay ng lola ko para manood ng T.V. </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">So while watching T.V., what happened if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Pumasok po si BBB pero lumabas din po kaagad, tapos isinalang po ni Kuya Estong iyong bala ng DVD na bold, nanood na po kami.</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>So while you were watching the movie, what happened next if any?</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Isinara po ni Kuya Estong iyong pintuan at bigla pong hinubad ni Kuya Estong ang short at panty ko.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">All of your dress? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Opo.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Then what happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Tapos po pinasok niya po yung pribadong ari niya.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>In her testimony, AAA admitted that she willingly went to Estong's house upon being invited by the latter. Moreover, during cross-examination, AAA admitted that the said incident on 15 May 2009 was not the first time Estong had carnal knowledge of her. According to AAA, there were five (5) prior incidents but, despite this, she still heeded the invitation of Estong to go watch television in Estong's house. In this particular case, the element of force or intimidation is absent to justify a conviction for rape. Reasonable doubt exists that Estong exerted force or intimidation on AAA when Estong had carnal knowledge of AAA. </p> <p> The action of Estong in placing an x-rated film which both Estong and AAA watched, if any, amounts to inducement or enticement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> under sexual abuse cases under RA 7610 but not to force or intimidation as an element of rape under the Revised Penal Code. In this case, what is clear is that AAA was aware of previous sexual advances by Estong and yet AAA still heeded the invitation of Estong. Moreover, AAA admitted that she repeatedly went to Estong's house whenever he would call her. Such is not the usual conduct of a rape victim. In fact, if there were indeed previous sexual encounters against her will, under ordinary circumstances, AAA would have avoided Estong and would have stayed away from Estong's house. The existence of willingness on the part of the victim, AAA, shows reasonable doubt that the carnal knowledge between AAA and Estong was not un-consensual. Accordingly, Estong must be acquitted of the charge of rape. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Estong is guilty of the crime of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 against BBB.

Galvez testified that she saw Estong sitting on a chair while BBB was holding his, penis and his other hand was mashing BBB's breast. Galvez confirmed that Bautista was likewise inside the room and was washing and slicing meat. Galvez testified that she did not see any indication that Bautista tried to stop or prevent Estong from sexually abusing BBB. According to Galvez, she heard Bautista utter the words: "patay nahuli tayo ni Ate Eva." When the barangay official arrived, Bautista also helped Estong escape which led to the pursuit by BSF Aranda. Eventually, BSF Aranda caught Estong in Maybunga. </p> <p> This Court agrees with the finding of both the RTC and CA that the testimonies of BBB and Galvez, including their positive identification of the two accused, outweigh the defenses of alibi and denial of Estong and Bautista. In <i>Garingarao v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this Court held that in cases of acts of lasciviousness and sexual abuse, the lone testimony of the offended party, if credible, is sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Furthermore, both denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses and constitute self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the positive declaration of a credible witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the present case, Estong and Bautista's defenses of alibi and denial must fail over the positive and straightforward testimonies of BBB and Galvez on the said incident. Both, Estong and Bautista are guilty of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>PARTIALLY GRANTS</b> the appeal. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 11 August 2017 finding appellant Anthony Chavez y Villareal @ Estong guilty of the crime of rape punishable under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Appellant Anthony Chavez y Villareal @ Estong is <b>ACQUITTED</b> in so far as his criminal liability for the crime of rape is concerned. </p><p> The Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the Decision dated 11 August 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08563, finding appellant Anthony Chavez y Villareal @ Estong and Michelle Bautista y Dela Cruz guilty beyond reasonable doubt of sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act No. 7610. We sustain the award of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages in Criminal Case No. 140190 and the imposition thereon of an interest at the rate of six percent (6%) <i>per annum</i> from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b> </p><p><em>Caguioa, J.
