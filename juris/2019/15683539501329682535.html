In 1988, he returned to the civil service as an employee of the Supreme Court. He eventually resigned in 1989 to work abroad.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>During the time Aniñon was separated from the civil service, the prevailing law governing retirement benefits was Presidential Decree No. 1146 (<i>Revised Government Insurance Act of 1977</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which amended and expanded Commonwealth Act (C.A.)

As the result of his voluntary separation from the service prior to obtaining the necessary eligibility, he received from the GSIS an amount of P16,345.12 representing the refund of his premiums,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to which he was entitled under Section 11(d) of C.A.

No. 8291 (<i>GSIS Act of 1997</i>), amending P.D. No. 1146, took effect. Under R.A. No. 8291, the retiree must have served a minimum of 15 years in the government to be eligible for retirement benefits;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> if the retiree was previously separated or retired from the Government but was reinstated or re-employed in the civil service, his length of service shall include the periods of service at different times under one or more employers<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> but shall exclude such number of years of service for which he already applied and was awarded benefits under earlier applicable retirement laws (<i>Previous Services</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The GSIS, through its Board of Trustees,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> reiterated this rule on computing total service in its <i>Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 8291</i> (Implementing Rules),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> thereby making the previously retired or separated civil servant in effect a new entrant upon re-employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In connection with the Implementing Rules, the GSIS issued an opinion barring full credit of service years to reinstated employees in case they retired prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 8291 and collected the benefits therefrom, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>An employee or member who, before Republic Act No. 8291 took effect, had retired and received gratuity benefit and refund of retirement premiums under the provisions of Republic Act No. 1616; and who re­entered government service a day after his retirement <b>cannot be allowed to retire under RA 8291</b>-with full credit of the service already paid pursuant to his previous retirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Subsequently, the GSIS requested the Department of Justice (DOJ) to confirm the opinion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Acting on the request, DOJ Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez rendered DOJ Opinion No. 106 dated December 17, 2004,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> holding thusly:<br><blockquote>x x x R.A. 8291 is a social legislation which provides for, among others, the retirement and separation benefits of government employees. It is well-settled that retirement laws are liberally construed in favor of the retirees.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Moreover, it appears that the issue discussed in the request for confirmatory opinion is not one of first impression. A reading of the Primer on the GSIS Act of 1997 issued by the GSIS seems to provide the answer therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote>It appears that the GSIS had issued in 1997 the Primer adverted to in DOJ Opinion No. 106 in order to address frequently-asked questions concerning R.A. No. 8291. A portion of the Primer reads:<br><blockquote><i>Can services for which retirement contributions have been refunded be included in the computation of service in case of reinstatement?</i><br>Yes, however, the corresponding contributions plus interests shall be deducted from benefits to be received. x x x<br><br><i>Are the previous services of an employee credited if upon reinstatement to the service, he/she refunded all the retirement benefits he/she received?</i><br>Yes, because technically the employee in this case has not received any retirement or separation benefits. Formerly, refund of retirement benefits received was a requirement upon reinstatement. Under R.A. 8291, there is no such requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>However, DOJ Opinion No. 106 contained the following qualification, to wit:<br><blockquote>With the foregoing provision in the Primer, <b>we believe that your opinion needs qualification</b>. In fine, the inclusion or exclusion of previous services of an employee in the computation of services for purposes of retirement under R.A. No. 8291 is dependent on whether said employee refunded his retirement benefits previously received anytime upon reinstatement to the service. Thus, if there was a <b>refund</b> of all retirement benefits he received, <b>all his previous services will be credited in the computation since technically said employee has not received any retirement or separation benefits</b>. If there was no refund, it goes without saying that his previous services will no longer be included in the computation of service for purposes of retirement under R.A. No. 8291.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To align with DOJ Opinion No. 106, the GSIS issued Policy and Procedural Guidelines No. (PPG) No. 183-06 on January 3, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which was published on January 28, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> whereby the GSIS clarified that a reinstated employee should be allowed full credit of previous services provided he/she meanwhile complied with the refund requirement, that is, to refund all retirement benefits received from his/her previous retirement or separation from service within 30 days from the publication of PPG No. 183-06.<br><br>In his letter dated November 20, 2006 addressed to Mr. Robert M. Agustin, Vice President, Social Insurance Operations Office I, of the GSIS,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Aniñon expressed his intention to retire on March 24, 2007, his 63<sup>rd</sup> birthday. For the purpose, he requested the full credit of his 12-year government service rendered prior to his reinstatement in 1996. However, having just learned about the refund requirement, he requested to be exempt from the coverage of PPG No. 183-06, specifically asking that he be allowed to belatedly refund the premiums returned in 1989, or, alternatively, to have the amount of the premiums deducted from his future retirement proceeds by way of offsetting.<br><br>However, Agustin denied Aniñon's request by letter dated January 24, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Aniñon then elevated his concern to the GSIS Board of Trustees. In his petition dated January 31, 2007,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> he reiterated his request and argued that PPG No. 183-06 violated his right to due process;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that publication of PPG No. 183-06 in a newspaper of general circulation was insufficient; that he was entitled to personal prior notice of PPG No. 183-06 and to a public hearing properly informing him that failure to pay the refund by the deadline would amount to a waiver;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that as a result, he learned of PPG No. 183-06 only on November 7, 2006, or over eight months past the deadline set for the refund of retirement benefits previously received by reinstated government employees;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and that PPG No. 183-06 also infringed his right to equal protection<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> because prior to its effectivity, reinstated employees were allowed to comply with the refund requirement through a "post-payment" scheme recognized by the GSIS in its Primer on RA 8291,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> whereby the corresponding contributions would instead be deducted or offset from benefits to be received.<br><br><center><b>Decision of the GSIS <br>Board of Trustees</b><br></center><br>In its decision rendered on December 12, 2007,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the GSIS Board of Trustees dismissed Aniñon's petition, ruling that PPG No. 183-06 did not violate his right to due process because based on <i>Dadole v.

To start with, the CA found that the GSIS had caused the publication of PPG No. 183-06 in newspapers of general circulation, that is, in <i>Manila Bulletin</i> on January 28, 2006 and in <i>People's Journal and Philippine Star</i> simultaneously on January 31, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The fact of publication as required by law was not disputable. On the other hand, there was neither law, including R.A. No. 8291, nor jurisprudence that required the GSIS to serve personal notices to all of its members as a condition to the effectivity against them of guidelines like those set in PPG No. 183-06. Evidently, therefore, the publication of PPG No. 183-06 in the three newspapers of general circulation sufficiently complied with the requirements of due process under the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><center><b>2.<br>To be entitled to full service credit, Aniñon as a reinstated employee must refund benefits previously received</b><br></center><br>We next review and resolve the merits of Aniñon's submission.<br><br>Section 10(b) of P.D. No. 1146, as amended by R.A. No. 8291, provides:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(b) All service credited for retirement, resignation or separation for which corresponding benefits have been awarded under this Act or other laws shall be <b>excluded</b> in the computation of service in case of reinstatement in the service of an employer and subsequent retirement or separation which is compensable under this Act. (Emphasis Supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>This provision contemplates the situation in which: (1) a government employee previously retired, resigned, or was otherwise separated from service; (2) he/she received benefits under R.A. No. 8291 or other applicable retirement laws by virtue of his/her first/previous retirement or separation; (3) he/she is reinstated to government service; (4) he/she subsequently retires or is separated from service; and (5) by virtue of his/her second/subsequent retirement or separation, he/she seeks to avail himself/herself of the benefits under R.A. No. 8291.<br><br>In such situation, years of service already counted and credited during his/her first/previous retirement shall not be creditable service for his/her second/subsequent retirement.<br><br>PPG No. 183-06 reiterates this general rule, and further classifies the reinstated government employee as a new entrant, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 8.6. Effect of Re-employment. - When a retiree is re­employed, his/her previous services credited at the time of his/her retirement shall be excluded in the computation of future benefits. In effect, he/she shall be considered a new entrant.<br></blockquote>The exclusion of the previous service from the computation of creditable service for the second/subsequent retirement effectively bars the retiree from receiving benefits twice for the same period of service. This rule is consistent with the constitutional prohibition against double compensation embodied in Section 8, Article IX-B, of the 1987 Constitution, to wit:<br><blockquote>Sec. 8. No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law, nor accept without the consent of the Congress, any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind from any foreign government.<br><br>Pensions or gratuities shall not be considered as additional, double or indirect compensation.<br></blockquote>On the other hand, PPG No. 183-06 stipulated as follows:<br><blockquote><b>III. COVERAGE</b><br><br>The Guidelines shall cover the following members who had previously retired and re-entered the government service before June 24, 1997:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Those who had previously resigned I retired and re-entered the government service prior to the effective date of R.A. 8291 on June 24, 1997 and had received the corresponding retirement benefits thereunder;<br><br></li><li>Those who had previously retired under RA 1616 but were paid only the refund of retirement premiums, both personal and government shares, by the GSIS without the gratuity benefit payable by the retirees' last employer due to the Agency's budgetary problems; and<br><br></li><li><b>Those who were separated from the service without having qualified under RA 660, RA 1616, or PD 1146 and, therefore, became entitled only to the refund of the personal share of retirement contributions, with interest.</b><br></li></ol></blockquote><b>IV. IMPLEMENTING POLICIES</b><br><br>1. An employee or member under any of the following situations shall be allowed to retire again with full service credit provided he refunds whatever benefits he had previously received, to wit: x x x x<br><br>2. The requirement for the refund shall be subject to the following conditions:<br><br><b>2.1 the affected member/s shall have thirty (30) days, counted from the date of publication of this Policy, within which to refund to the System the applicable retirement benefits received by him from his previous retirement/separation, as follows: x x x refund of retirement premiums, personal and/or government share/s paid by GSIS x x x</b><br><br>2.2 with respect to the retirement/separation benefits actually paid by the GSIS to the retiree in his previous retirement I resignation, the gross amount thereof shall be assessed a corresponding simple interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per month, computed from the date the said benefits were paid to him up to the actual date of his refund to the GSIS of the said benefits;<br><br>2.3 x x x<br><br><b>2.4 failure on the part of the employee/member to comply with the cash refund as required in the preceding paragraph shall be deemed&nbsp; a waiver on his part to claim for additional retirement/separation benefits from the inclusion of his prior services already credited in previous retirement/resignation to his subsequent retirement;<br><br>2.5 off-setting or deduction of the retirement/resignation benefits previously received from accrued retirement/resignation benefits due to subsequent retirement shall not be allowed x x x</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>PPG No. 183-06 thus allowed the full credit of previous service in connection with the reinstated employee's second/subsequent retirement provided he/she refunded all the benefits received from his/her first/previous retirement on or before February 27, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, PPG No. 183-06 disallowed the offsetting method (that is, to have benefits previously received deducted from proceeds to be received in the second/subsequent retirement). The refund requirement was consistent with the rule against unjust enrichment, and allowed the retiring employee to enjoy the benefits under R.A. No. 8291 in full, even those pertaining to his previous service, without violating the proscription against double compensation.<br><br>Herein, Aniñon has sought to include as creditable service his 12-year previous service for purposes of his subsequent retirement. The controversy arose only when he requested the GSIS for an exemption from the application of PPG 183-06, that is: (a) to allow him to comply with the refund requirement even beyond the deadline; or (b) to allow him to simply offset the amount of the refund against benefits he would subsequently receive.<br><br><center><b>3.<br>PPG No. 183-06 did not impair Aniñon's vested rights</b><br></center><br>Relying on <i>Parreño v.

Montesclaros</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court has ruled that the vested right to retirement benefits when the employee retired and met the eligibility requirements. In that regard, R.A. No. 8291 enumerates the eligibility requirements for the government employee to be entitled to retirement benefits, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SECTION 13-A. Conditions for Entitlement. - A member who retires from the service shall be entitled to the retirement benefits in paragraph (a) of Section 13 hereof: Provided, That:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">he has rendered at least fifteen (15) years of service;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">he is at least sixty (60) years of age at the time of retirement; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">he is not receiving a monthly pension benefit from permanent total disability.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On the other hand, PPG No. 183-06<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> relevantly stated:<br><blockquote>Section 8.8 Filing and Processing.<br><br>8.8.1 - The following documents shall be filed in duplicate with the GSIS Head office or any Branch Office, as the case may be, at least Thirty (30) Days before the date of retirement for processing and payment of benefit:<br><br>(1) Application for Retirement/Old-age Benefits duly approved and endorsed by the head office who shall be responsible for compliance with all laws and legal requirements covering retirement;<br><br>(1) Service Record;<br><br>(2) Clearance from the Ombudsman; and,<br><br>(3) Such other documents as may be required by the GSIS.<br><br>8.8.2 - The GSIS shall pay the retirement benefits to the Employee on his/her last day of service in the government, <b>provided that all <u>requirements enumerated in 8.8.1 are submitted</u> to the GSIS at least Thirty (30) Days before the date of retirement</b> x x x (Emphasis Supplied)<br></blockquote>For sure, meeting the requisite length of government service, years of age, and non-receipt of permanent total disability benefits did not <i>ipso facto</i> vest the government employee the right to the retirement benefits available under R.A. No. 8291. He/She must also have formally "retired" from service by filing an application for retirement and submitting the required documents to the GSIS.<br><br>The submission of the documentary requirements to the GSIS was as much a condition <i>sine qua non</i> to the vesting of one's right to the retirement benefits as the meeting of the eligibility requirements itself. The GSIS, being the statutorily-mandated body to process benefit claims under R.A. No. 8291,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> was empowered to determine the employee's eligibility to receive retirement benefits based on his/her application and submission of corresponding requirements. Certainly, an individual's entitlement to retirement benefits cannot be left to his/her self-determination. We also cannot expect the GSIS to unilaterally pay retirement benefits <i>motu proprio</i> whenever a government employee attained the age of retirement.<br><br>Under the foregoing, the CA was correct in ruling that, at the time of the effectivity of PPG 183-06, Aniñon's retirement benefits <i>sans</i> his formal application for retirement and the determination by the GSIS of his eligibility and compliance with the documentary requirements were only future benefits over which he did not have any vested right. As such, the guidelines under PPG 183-06 could not have impaired what was then a mere expectancy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><center><b>4.<br>PPG No. 183-06 did not apply to the petitioner</b><br></center><br>Aniñon submits that prior to the effectivity of PPG No. 183-06, the GSIS allowed compliance with the refund requirement through the offsetting method, pursuant to which the benefits previously received would instead be deducted from the proceeds of the last retirement.<br><br>To recall, Aniñon had only accumulated 12 years of service in the government upon being separated from service in 1989. Hence, he was not yet eligible to receive benefits under prevailing retirement laws,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> which required at least 15 years of government service.<br><br>Nevertheless, Aniñon collected P16,345.12 from the GSIS because Section 11(d) of C.A. No. 186, the law then in force, entitled him to the refund of his own premiums and voluntary deposits, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 11. (a) x x x<br><br>(d) Upon dismissal for cause or on voluntary separation, he shall be entitled only to his own premiums and voluntary deposits, if any, plus interest of three per centum per annum, compounded monthly.<br></blockquote>At this point, we clarify and point out that Aniñon was voluntarily separated from service in 1989. He did not retire or receive retirement benefits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> inasmuch as he did not possess the required eligibility at that time. Thus, when he collected the sum of his premiums or personal contributions, he received only the return of his premiums.<br><br>That no retirement benefit was paid pertaining to Aniñon's 12-year period of previous service leads to the inescapable conclusion that he would not be awarded retirement benefits twice for the same period. Obviating the danger of double compensation with respect to his subsequent retirement thus removes Aniñon from the application of Section 10(b) of P.D. No. 1146, as amended by R.A. No. 8291, as well as the requirements under PPG 183-06. On this basis, the GSIS plainly erred in disallowing outright his previous service for non-compliance with guidelines not even applicable to his situation.<br><br>However, this conclusion should not be construed as the <i>ipso facto</i> inclusion of his previous service in the computation of his creditable service. In order that his previous service may be appreciated for purposes of computing creditable service, Aniñon should pay back to the GSIS the premiums returned to him in 1989. Fairness demands that the corresponding premiums be paid for his prior years of service to enable him to receive retirement benefits pertaining to that period.<br><br><center><b>5.<br>Aniñon could be allowed to refund amount through deduction from future retirement proceeds</b><br></center><br>It is not disputed that the GSIS returned Aniñon's personal contributions pertaining to the period of his previous service. Thus, upon his subsequent retirement, the required contributions for said period remain unpaid.<br><br>The Revised Implementing Rules<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> allows any premiums in arrears to be offset against future retirement proceeds, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SECTION 16. Effects of Non-Remittance of Contributions and Other Amounts on the Eligibility to Benefits of Members. -<br><br>16.1. x x x<br><br>16.2. <b>Any unremitted premium contributions and loan amortizations and other amounts due the GSIS shall be deducted from the proceeds of the loans and claims that will be due the member.</b> (bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The GSIS relies on member and employer contributions to properly administer social security and insurance benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> As such, it is only fair for Aniñon to remit the contributions covering the period of his previous service before he could derive retirement benefits therefrom.<br><br>However, we clarify that the GSIS cannot deprive Aniñon of the opportunity to make good his obligation through the offsetting method, which the law allowed under the particular circumstances of his case. As stated, Aniñon was separated from service in 1989 and received a return of his contributions but he continued to be a GSIS member and remained entitled to certain benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, his eligibility to receive retirement benefits should not be affected by a deficiency in his account.<br><br>This interpretation of the pertinent GSIS rules and regulations is supported by the basic principle that social legislation, such as retirement laws, must be liberally construed in the retiree-beneficiary's favor. C.A. No. 186, P.D. No. 1146, and R.A.
