Their testimonies showed that on September 5, 2011 at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening[, a] female confidential informant (<b>CI for brevity</b>) "handled" by dela Cerna, came to the PDEA office and gave an information that an "<b>alias Bebeng</b>" (<b>or hereinafter Dy</b>) is engaged in selling illegal drugs. Dela Cerna already learned from other reports about the drug activities of Dy and x x x [Cepeda] from other PDEA agents even before his own asset gave such information to him.<br><br>Dela Cerna relayed the information he received to their Regional Director who then instructed dela Cerna to form and lead a team for the conduct of a buy[-]bust operation. Orcales was designated as the poseur[-]buyer and Aguilar as the arresting officer. The necessary documents were then prepared x x x. A camera was also prepared. The buy[-]bust money was given to Orcales before the team composed of about eight (8) members including the CI, left the PDEA office at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening to proceed to the area of the operation using their unmarked Toyota Innova vehicle.<br><br>Upon nearing the target area which is somewhere along Osmena<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[10]</sup></font> Extension and just near Mindanao University of Science and Technology (MUST), Orcales and the CI alighted and walked their way to the house of their target. The rest of the team stayed in the vehicle to wait for the pre­arranged signal which is a missed call to be made by Orcales. The house of their target is not visible from the spot where the vehicle was parked.<br><br>The CI led Orcales to a wooden two-storey [house] where the CI then called out "Bebeng" (Dy). Dy appeared at the small terrace on the second floor just right outside the main door, and invited the CI and Orcales to come upstairs. The CI appeared to be a friend of "Bebeng", and Orcales just stayed behind the CI when the two of them went upstairs. Upon reaching Dy, the CI introduced Orcales to Dy as a friend who wanted to buy shabu worth Php500.00. She then called out "<b>Loloy</b>" (<b>or hereinafter Cepeda</b>) who came out from the end room of the house.<br><br>When Cepeda reached Dy, he got a sachet of shabu from his left pocket and handed it to Orcales who extended his hand to receive the sachet. The CI and Dy continued their casual talk for a little more time after which the CI and Orcales went down the house. Upon reaching the ground, Orcales made a missed call to Aguilar. When Aguilar received the missed call, she informed the rest of [the] team, and they all rushed to the house of Bebeng taking them about three minutes to reach the area which was about 150 meters away from the place where they parked the vehicle. The way to the house of Dy and Cepeda was a narrow pathway on the side of the big drainage beside MUST, and one has to be careful or be in danger of falling in the canal.<br><br>They met Orcales along the way upon nearing the house of Bebeng and Orcales joined the team in going to the house of Bebeng but he (Orcales) instructed his CI to hide herself. The agents with Cardona leading the way, went straight to the second floor where the main entrance door was already slightly open. Upon entering the house, they immediately saw Dy and Cepeda, and the agents then introduced themselves. Orcales himself pointed to the team "Bebeng" (Dy) and "Loloy" (Cepeda). Dy had no reaction, but Cepeda ran inside the room. The agents immediately went after Cepeda and upon entering the room, they saw him throwing something but they could not locate the spot where it landed because it was nighttime and the room was dimly lighted. Dela Cerna and two other agents exerted efforts to find the object which Cepeda may have thrown with the aid of a flashlight attached to the rifle of dela Cerna, but they failed to find anything.<br><br>They arrested Cepeda and searched his body and they discovered from his right pocket the buy[-]bust money and in the left pocket another sachet of shabu. They also seized one (1) lighter, improvised needle, some pieces of aluminum foils (sic) which they found on top of a table in the sala. The said items were then gathered in one cellophane which was marked by Aguilar "RLA". Orcales marked the sachet he bought "BB-VCO" and turned over the said sachet to Aguilar. Aguilar also marked with her initials the sachet recovered from the pocket of Cepeda.<br><br>Before conducting the inventory, they called for the presence of a barangay kagawad and a mediaman from Bombo Radyo, and upon their arrival, Aguilar conducted an Inventory at the crime scene of x x x the seized items witnessed by a barangay kagawad and media personality while pictures were being taken. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Meanwhile, the defense presented a counterstatement of facts, which was summarized in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>Accused William Cepeda and Loren Dy, who claimed to be husband and wife, both took the witness stand to deny the charges in these two cases. According to them, on September 5, 2011 at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening, they were in their house at Osmena Extension, Cagayan de Oro City. The house they were living (sic) is a two-storey house, but they are occupying only the second floor. At that time, Cepeda and Dy were already lying down in their bedroom while watching television. Also inside the room was their daughter-in-law Elda Ubanan, and the latter's baby, while their other children already entered their respective rooms.<br><br>While watching television, they felt the house shaking and they heard thudding sounds and they sensed that there were many people going upstairs. Cepeda peeped through the window to find out what was going on outside, and he saw somebody (they came to know later as dela Cerna) entering the house through the window of the room of his son Werlan Cepeda and the latter's wife Jenny Sumagang Cepeda, who were already lying down. Cepeda also saw armed persons kicking the door of their house uttering in a loud voice, "PDEA ni, raid ni" (We are PDEA agents, this is a raid). Cepeda followed by Dy went to the bedroom of their son and upon entering the room, Cepeda saw his son already handcuffed and ordered not to move, while the persons who were kicking the main door successfully destroyed the lock of the door and entered the house.<br><br>When the armed persons, some in civilian clothes and others in clothes with PDEA print, were already inside, and they appeared to be looking for someone. They asked Cepeda if anyone was occupying the second floor, and Cepeda answered only his family. The man asked Cepeda his name and the latter answered he is "Loloy", but the man poked his gun at Cepeda and ordered him to lie face down on the floor. Cepeda asked what offense he had committed, and also demanded to see a search warrant, but a lady (accused came to know later as Aguilar) in the company of the group berated him saying, "keep quiet or else I will empty the bullets of my gun in your body". Upon hearing the threat, Cepeda stopped complaining, and he was then handcuffed at his back. Cepeda was bodily searched and was made to remove his pants.<br><br>The armed persons then searched all the rooms in the house for about two hours from 9:00 o'clock in the evening to 11:00 o'clock in the evening, by themselves without allowing any of the occupants of the house to witness the search. Cepeda did not know if they recovered any items during the search because they never showed anything to him. When the armed persons came out of the rooms, Cepeda noticed that they were taking pictures but he was not aware what they were photographing because Cepeda was all the time lying face down on the floor handcuffed. They waited for the barangay kagawad who finally arrived at past 11:00 o'clock in the evening, Kagawad Alberto Adecer together with Barangay Tanod Delos Santos. Cepeda overheard the kagawad saying, "so the raid was over", and a piece of paper was handed by Aguilar to [K]agawad Adecer and Tanod delos Santos for them to sign. Kagawad Adecer and x x x Tanod delos Santos were reluctant to sign x x x because according to them they were not present during the incident, but Aguilar prevailed upon them to just sign the piece of paper. After the signing, Cepeda and Dy were brought to the PDEA office. At the office, Cepeda pleaded that he be submitted for a drug test, but his plea was ignored.<br><br>When the barangay officials arrived, Werlan Cepeda tried to plead with them as to why he (Werlan) was also being handcuffed, but dela Cerna pulled Werlan away and brought him downstairs. Werlan was being talked out (sic) by Dela Cerna to admit that they were selling shabu so that he would be released, but Werlan was steadfast that they were not selling shabu. Before the PDEA left together with the two accused, Werlan was released but was warned that they will just bring their parents (accused) first and will just come back for him (Werlan), as they (PDEA) are not yet finished.<br><br>Cepeda and Dy came to know the names of some of the persons who forcibly entered [their] house to be Aguilar, dela Cerna, and Orcales, when the said persons took the witness stand. They claimed that the testimonies [of] the prosecution witnesses relative (sic) to a woman who is familiar with Dy and to which Dy had a conversation at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of September 5, 2011 is a lie, as no such woman talked to Dy during the time mentioned. Cepeda saw Orcales for the first time only when Orcales took the witness (sic) to testify in these cases. When the PDEA entered the house, Dy was washing clothes. [Cepeda] was handcuffed and made to lie face down on the floor while Dy was also handcuffed and made to sit on the bed crying. Cepeda was bodily searched for three times, the first was immediately after the PDEA entered the house, the second was when he was lying face down on the floor inside their bedroom, and the third was when they came back to his (Cepeda) room after their search in the other rooms. Dy was also searched but nothing was found from her body.<br><br>The only items they discovered was the income of Cepeda from his driving consisting of P1.00, P5.00 and P10.00, and the latter's license, and there was not even a P100.00 bill as his income as motorela driver do (sic) not even reach Php500.00 a day. He was not selling shabu because he had no shabu. His family is being helped financially by his sister-in-law in Australia who is sending them Php3,000.00 to Php3,500.00 a month. The motorela he was driving was given to him, and he had to gather and budget the daily income, and appropriate it only every Sunday. He pays the electric and water bills, and the rest of the motorela earning is sufficient for them to survive a simple living.<br><br>The testimony of Aguilar that the P500.00 buy[-]bust money and a sachet of shabu were recovered from his pocket was a lie. The testimony of Orcales that Cepeda is selling shabu is also a lie. As to the reason why the PDEA agents would arrest them, he could recall a previous incident where their neighbor was arrested and the neighbor got mad at them (Cepeda) because they suspected his (Cepeda) son was the one who caused the arrest. The neighbor shouted at them (Cepeda) saying that there will be a time that all of them will also be arrested. Cepeda revealed that the said neighbor had a relative working with the PDEA, which they discovered at the time Cepeda and Dy were already at the PDEA office after their arrest in this case. A woman thereat whom he does not know revealed to them that the Masibas' are her relatives.<br><br>The testimonies of both accused were corroborated by Jenny Sumagang Cepeda, Elda Ubanan, and Werlan Cepeda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </blockquote><br><br><i>Ruling of the RTC</i><br><br>In the Judgment promulgated on July 24, 2014, the RTC found Dy and Cepeda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 5 and 11, respectively, Article II, RA 9165:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court hereby finds that:<br><br></b><ol><li><b>In Criminal Case No. 2011-904, accused WILLIAM CEPEDA <i>y</i>&nbsp; DULTURA&nbsp; is&nbsp; GUILTY&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; reasonable doubt of the crime defined and penalized under Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165, and hereby imposes the penalty of imprisonment ranging from Twelve [12] years and one [1] day to Thirteen [13] years, and to pay a Fine in the amount of P300,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of non-payment of Fine;<br><br></b></li><li><b>In Criminal Case No. 2011-905, accused WILLIAM CEPEDA <i>y</i> DULTURA and LOREN DY <i>y</i> SERO are GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, and hereby imposes the penalty of LIFE imprisonment and for each to pay a Fine in the amount of P500,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of non-payment of Fine;</b></li></ol><br>The sachets of shabu are hereby confiscated to be destroyed in the manner provided for by law.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br><br>The RTC favored the testimony of the prosecution witnesses as it found no ill motive on their part to impute such crimes against Dy and Cepeda if they were not truly guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As to the non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, the RTC found that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of the law and that the buy-bust team was nevertheless able to preserve the integrity and probative value of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Insisting on their innocence, Dy and Cepeda jointly appealed to the CA.<br><br><i>Ruling of the CA</i><br><br>In the CA Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC Judgment <i>in toto</i>, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>FOR THESE REASONS, the consolidated Judgment in Criminal Case Nos. 2011-904 and 2011-905 appealed from is AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In a Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated May 29, 2016, the counsel of Dy and Cepeda withdrew his representation.

It bears stressing that the ultimate end of quelling the drug war must, without exception, be achieved within the limits of our laws.<br><br><i>Firstly</i>, the mandatory requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 were not faithfully complied with. Case law is firm in that the procedure enshrined in Section 21 is a matter of substantive law and cannot be ignored at the whim of law enforcement agents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><i>Secondly</i>, the prosecution did not present justifiable grounds for such non-compliance. Notwithstanding the clear import of the records, the prosecution, despite the opportunity to do so, failed to explain the reason behind the lapses in procedure. Thus, given the unjustified breaches of Section 21, there arises reasonable doubt as to the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, there being merit in the appeal, the Court, in the interest of substantive justice, finds the need to revisit the conviction of Cepeda despite his failure to perfect an appeal before the Court.<br><br><i>Non-observance of the procedure<br>under Section 21 of RA 9165; failure<br>to establish justifiable grounds</i><br><br>Dangerous drugs cases are unique. The fungible nature of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in such cases requires the adoption of special rules in order to ensure moral certainty in the conviction of the accused. In this regard, the law, specifically through Section 21<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[21]</sup></font> of RA 9165, mandates the following procedure in the seizure, custody, and disposition of dangerous drugs:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> – The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br></blockquote><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall,<b> immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused</b> or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, <b>a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.]</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Meanwhile, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 provides additional custody requirements and likewise added a "saving clause" in case of non-compliance with such requirements:<br><br><blockquote<b><blockquote><b>SECTION 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> </b>— The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:</blockquote></blockquote<b><blockquote><blockquote<b><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="left">(a) </div></td> <td width="95%" valign="top"><div align="justify">The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her t representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that <b>the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted</b> at the place where the search warrant is served;

This case demonstrates such a situation.<br><br>Without this appeal of last resort, Dy and Cepeda would have been damned to live the rest of their lives languishing in prison for allegedly selling 0.04 gram of <i>shabu</i> worth Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00). The potential gain of such measly amount to the accused, even when taken together with the potential damage to the public, undeniably pales in comparison to a lifetime deprived of liberty and separation from society.<br><br>The Court is not oblivious to the logistical challenges that anti-drug operations pose, and neither is it unmindful of the wide latitude for abuse in the hands of our law enforcement agents. However, bearing the foregoing in mind, the Court wishes to remind our officers of what is at stake in dangerous drugs cases. More than the protection of the public, it is the life and liberty of the citizenry that hang in the balance. In this case, the impropriety committed by the buy-bust team is almost tangible. The procedure employed was a poor imitation of the mandatory procedure laid down by law.<br><br>Too, the Court is dismayed with the prosecution of this case, as represented by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). The records show that the Appellee's Brief before the CA was due for filing on December 27, 2014.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[45]</sup></font> However, the OSG went on to file <b>six (6)</b> motions for extension,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> claiming at some point that a draft had already been made, albeit undergoing revision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> And yet, even with a total extension of <b>one hundred fifty (150) days</b> to file its pleading, <b>no Appellee's Brief was ever filed</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Meanwhile, Dy and Cepeda were already serving out their sentences. This is aggravated by the fact that they have been confined starting 2011, as the crimes charged are non-bailable. As lawyer for the People, the OSG should have been more forthcoming with the CA, instead of requesting for additional periods only to end up not filing anything at all.<br><br>It has been eight (8) years since Dy and Cepeda have been in confinement. Surely, this acquittal will be welcomed by the accused. However, there remains no recompense for the time spent in prison under an erroneous conviction, regardless of its duration. It is in this light that the Court restores the liberty of the accused.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b> and the Decision dated May 3, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
