Thereafter, PO3 Rico arrested accused-appellant and recovered from him the marked money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>PO1 Lamsen kept the plastic sachet in his possession en route to the police station. Thereat, the plastic sachet and the marked money were marked, inventoried, and photographed, in the presence of accused-appellant, Emil Toledo (Toledo) and Orlando Peralta (Peralta), who were the representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> PO1 Lamsen, PO3 Rico, Toledo, and Peralta thereafter signed the Receipt of Property Seized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> PO1 Lamsen explained that he did not mark the seized items at the place of arrest since he feared that two or three of accused-appellant's friends who were in the area would cause trouble following the arrest of accused-appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On cross-examination, PO1 Lamsen further elaborated that he kept the plastic sachet for about an hour, from apprehension up to the time of arrival of the representatives from the media and DOJ at the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He also stated that the intelligence operatives at the police station invited <i>barangay</i> officials during the briefing via telephone calls but nobody responded to their invitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>PO1 Lamsen, together with PO3 Rico and accused-appellant, brought the request<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for a laboratory examination, as prepared by Senior Police Officer 1 (SPO1) Jojit Ocromas (Ocromas) and signed by Police Chief Inspector (PCI) Dominick S.

People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> elaborates on the chain of custody in this wise:<br><blockquote>As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>The four critical links that must be established in the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs are as follows: (1) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; (2) the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; (3) the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and, (4) the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Section 21 of RA 9165 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice, and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; x x x<br></blockquote></blockquote>Section 21 (a) of the IRR of the same law additionally prescribes as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items; x x x<br></blockquote></blockquote>Evaluated against the abovementioned provisions, the evidence adduced by the prosecution instantly reveals discrepancies.<br><br>First, the marking of the seized item by the apprehending officer was not immediately done at the place of arrest. PO1 Lamsen explained that he did not mark the seized item at the place of arrest since he feared that accused-appellant's friends who were in the area would cause trouble following the arrest of accused-appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This excuse, however, proved flimsy after further questioning by the court, as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">You said earlier Mr. Witness, that you did not [immediately mark] the seized item from the accused because you were afraid that trouble might [ensue], did you say that a while ago?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Yes, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">What made you say so? x x x</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Because some of his friends, [Y]our Honor, [were] there.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">How many of them?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">About two or three, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Did they manifest any actuation for you to think that they would cause trouble?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">What?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">In their action, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">What actions did they manifest?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">[They were murmuring something], [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">But you were with another [p]olice [o]fficer?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">[PO3] Rico?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Did you have your service firearm that time?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes, [Y]our Honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">So [your] possession of your firearm [did not make you feel secure]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">We have not [thought] of that, [Y]our Honor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Another deviation from the rule involving the persons required by law to witness the taking of inventory and photographs was also apparent.
