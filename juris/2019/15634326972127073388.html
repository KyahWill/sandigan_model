According to the trial court, it was not physically impossible for appellant to have been at the <i>locus criminis</i> on the date and time in question. It sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with all the accessory penalties. It further directed him to pay complainant P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br><center><b>The Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</b><br></center><br>On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for finding him guilty of rape despite AAA's alleged failure to clearly, directly, and spontaneously identify him as the assailant. He stressed that since the supposed <i>locus criminis</i> was adjacent to the road and numerous residential houses, it was highly improbable for people not to have come to help complainant, if truly she got raped there.<br><br>In refutation, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), through Assistant Solicitor General Reynaldo L. Saludares and Associate Solicitor Ron Winston A. Reyes averred that AAA positively identified appellant as the one who sexually ravished her near the cemetery around 4 o'clock in the afternoon of March 15, 2008. The trial court found her testimony credible in contrast with appellant's unsubstantiated, nay, inherently weak denial and alibi.<br><br>In its assailed Decision dated July 31, 2014, the Court of Appeals affirmed. It found that AAA did not identify appellant solely on the basis of the <i>maong</i> short pants she saw on the clothesline outside his house. It concurred with the trial court's finding that she positively identified appellant as the predator who sexually violated her. She clearly recognized him because earlier that day, she went to his house and personally saw appellant there. She even handed a solicitation letter to his wife.<br><br><center><b>The Present Appeal</b><br></center><br>Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for his acquittal.

Consequently, even standing alone, AAA's testimony is sufficient to support appellant's conviction for rape, given the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The Court has ruled that it is instinctive for a young, unmarried woman to protect her honor and it is thus difficult to believe that she would fabricate a tale of rape, allow the examination of her private parts, and permit herself to be subject of a public trial had she not really been raped.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Moreover, We have consistently held that the testimony of minor victims is normally given full weight and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>As it was, appellant's conviction was not based alone on AAA's testimony. The trial court also considered Dr. Bae's corroborative medical findings and testimony pertaining to AAA's non virgin state, lacerated hymen at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, and contusions and abrasions she sustained on her lower back and shoulders. A hymenal laceration is the best evidence of forcible sexual penetration. It does not matter whether it is healed or fresh.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Indeed, when the rape victim's detailed, positive and categorical testimony about the sexual violation she experienced solidly conforms with the medical finding of hymenal laceration, the same is sufficient to support a verdict of conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Notably, appellant himself did not impute any ulterior motive which could have impelled AAA to falsely charge him with such heinous crime as rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In fact, he even testified that he only saw AAA for the first time when she came to the police station where he got detained.<br><br>Appellant, nonetheless, attempts to destroy AAA's credibility citing some purported improbabilities in her testimony. On this score, he raises two points: <i>first</i>, AAA failed to identify him at the police station; and <i>second</i>, he could not have raped AAA near the road and surrounding residential houses without alerting people to come and give succor to her.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>AAA testified she knew appellant because she went to his house to solicit funds for her group's attendance and participation at the International Youth Congress. Appellant was there and so was his wife. Before she left, she handed a solicitation letter to appellant's wife. Then the rape incident happened. But right after, she and her father reported appellant's crime to the police station. Along with the police officer, they proceeded to appellant's house but he was not there. She recognized, though, a pair of <i>maong</i> short pants hanging on the clothesline outside the house to be the same pair appellant wore when he raped her. In fine, AAA consistently and positively identified appellant, and no other, as the sexual predator who violated her.<br><br>We, therefore, reject appellant's claim that AAA initially pointed to someone else when she visited the police station and turned to him only when prodded by the police. At any rate, it is settled that in rape cases, the identity of the offender is often indelibly printed in the mind of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>As for appellant's theory that he could not have raped AAA in a place near the road and surrounding residential houses without alerting people to come and help her, the Court has consistently recognized that rape may be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along roadside, within school premises, inside an occupied house, and even where other members of the family are sleeping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> For lust is no respecter of time or place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>We now reckon with appellant's denial and alibi. He claims he was working in Sabang, Puerto Galera when the incident took place at Barangay YYY, Municipality of ZZZ, Province of Oriental Mindoro.<br><br>Alibi is the weakest of all defenses because it can easily be fabricated. More so, when as in this case, it is unsubstantiated, nay, devoid of any showing that it was impossible for the accused to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> on the day and time the crime was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In any event, alibi cannot prevail over the victim's positive and unwavering identification of the accused as the one who succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her through force and violence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> So must it be.<br><br>Another piece of evidence appellant attempts to destroy is the <i>maong</i> short pants hanging on the clothesline outside his house right after the incident. Appellant asserts that the <i>maong</i> short pants which belonged to him went missing the day after the incident. Appellant's theory is flimsy. For one, he was not convicted based alone on these <i>maong</i> short pants. He was convicted mainly on the bases of AAA's positive identification of him as the one who hit her head, punched her in the stomach, dragged her to a grassy area, forced her to lie on the ground, undressed her, punched her one more time, and inserted his penis in her vagina. Then there were the corroborative medical findings of, Dr. Bae regarding AAA's non-virgin state and lacerated hymen. Appellant's pair of <i>maong</i> short pants seen hanging on the clothesline was just another piece of corroborative evidence of AAA's positive identification of appellant as the one who raped her.<br><br>Be that as it may, appellant's assigned errors all dwell on the issue of credibility. Suffice it to state that the Court generally accords full respect to the trial court's factual findings on the credibility of witnesses especially when the same carry the concurrence of the Court of Appeals. In the absence of any showing that the trial court had misapprehended the facts or disregarded the evidence on record, there is no valid reason to depart from such factual findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>All told, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming appellant's conviction for rape and the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on him. This is in accordance with in Article 266-A, in relation to 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, viz:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. - Rape is committed:<br><br>"1) <b>By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman</b> under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>"a) <b>Through force</b>, threat, or intimidation;<br><br><center>xxxx<br></center><br>Article 266-B. Penalty. - <b>Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.</b><br><br>xxxx (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court, however, modifies the awards of civil indemnity and exemplary damages. In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the award of civil indemnity should be reduced from P100,000.00 to P75,000.00 while the award of exemplary damages, increased from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00. On the other hand, the grant of P75,000.00 as moral damages is affirmed. Further, the Court imposes six percent interest <i>per annum</i> on these amounts from finality of this decision, until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision dated July 31, 2014 of the Court of Appeals, <b>AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION</b>.<br><br>Appellant Allan Siscar y Andrade is found guilty of "<b>Rape</b>" and sentenced to <b><i>Reclusion Perpetua</i></b>.
