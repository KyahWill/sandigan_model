After SPO2 Yema had confirmed the tip with the barangay captain and Castillo's neighbors, a buy bust team was formed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> At 12:00 noon on October 26, 2006, the team composed of SPO2 Yema, SPO1 Quinio, SPO3 Whency Aro, SPO2 Pera, and SPO3 Fortunato Katigbak, together with a civilian asset, arrived near a covered basketball court in Barangay 7, Lipa City to conduct the buy-bust operation against Castillo. Assigned to be the poseur-buyer, the asset was given the marked money consisting of a one-piece P100.00 bill and a one-piece "P200.00 bill.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Upon seeing Castillo, the asset approached him while the police officers watched from their vehicle about 10 meters away from the basketball court. The officers saw the asset hand over the marked money to Castillo. Castillo, in turn, pulled out of his pocket a plastic playing cards case and from it, took out a small sachet, which he gave to the asset. After the exchange, the asset touched his head, signaling that the transaction had been consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> At the signal, the police officers alighted from the vehicle and approached the asset and Castillo. The asset gave the plastic sachet to SPO2 Yema while SPO1 Quinio seized the marked money from Castillo. After a body search on Castillo, SPO2 Yema recovered four (4) plastic sachets containing crystalline substances suspected to be shabu, which were all placed inside a plastic case of playing cards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> The officers brought the items inside their vehicle, which was still parked near the place of arrest. There, SPO2 Yema marked the plastic sachet subject of the buy-bust "DRY-JMC-BB," and the other four (4) plastic sachets recovered from the body search "DRY-JMC-P-1" to "DRY­ JMC-P-4." The plastic playing cards case was marked "DRY-JMC-P." Afterwards, the officers brought Castillo to the Lipa City Police Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> There, the prosecution further narrated, the seized items were photographed along with the marked money and Castillo. The seized items were also inventoried, as witnessed by Limbo, the Department of Justice representative, Barangay Chair Christopher Latayan (Barangay Chair Latayan), SPO2 Yema, and Castillo, who all signed the Certificate of Inventory. SPO2 Yema and SPO1 Quinio then prepared and signed a Joint Affidavit of Arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> SPO2 Pera also prepared a Letter-Request for Laboratory Examination of the substances seized.

They poked a gun at his side, arrested him, and brought him to the Lipa City Police Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> There, Castillo saw what appeared to be shabu on a table. One (1) of the police officers forced him to point to the substance while his photo was being taken.

People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this Court underscored the fungible nature of dangerous drugs, warranting the need for faithful compliance with the chain of custody requirements: </p><blockquote> <p> Indeed, the likelihood of tampering, loss or mistake with respect to an exhibit is greatest when the exhibit is small and is one that has physical characteristics fungible in nature and similar in form to substances familiar to people in their daily lives. . . .</p> <p> A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature. The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility, that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases — by accident or otherwise — in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. Hence, in authenticating the same, a standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Specifically, compliance with the chain of custody requirements under Section 21 protects the integrity of confiscated drugs in four (4) aspects: </p><blockquote> <p> [F]irst, the nature of the substances or items seized; second, the quantity (e.g., weight) of the substances or items seized; third, the relation of the substances or items seized to the incident allegedly causing their seizure; and fourth, the relation of the substances or items seized to the person/s alleged to have been in possession of or peddling them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> There are four (4) links in the chain of custody of the confiscated item that need to be established: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>[F]irst</i>, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i>second</i>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i>third</i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and <em>fourth</em>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The seizure and marking of the dangerous drugs from the accused to the apprehending officer form the first crucial link in the chain of custody. While the marking of the dangerous drugs seized from the accused does not explicitly form part of the chain of custody requirements under Section 21, it is indispensable in ensuring that the integrity and evidentiary value of the dangerous drugs have been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p><p> In <i>People v. Saunar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> this Court discussed the purpose of marking and emphasized that it is a separate requirement from inventorying and photographing: </p><blockquote> <p> Although the requirement of ''marking" is not found in Republic Act No. 9165, its significance lies in ensuring the authenticity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. In <i>People v. Dahil</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> Crucial in proving the chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs or other related items immediately after they have been seized from the accused. "Marking" means the placing by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials and signature on the items seized. Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link; hence, it is vital that the seized contraband be immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. <i>The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, thus, preventing switching, planting or contamination of evidence</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Such significance impels the presence of third-party witnesses during the actual seizure and marking, which must<em> immediately </em>follow seizure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The presence of third-party witnesses during seizure and marking ensures that whatever items are subsequently inventoried, photographed, examined, and presented in court are the same substances that were initially obtained from the accused. </p><p> In <i>People v. Tomawis</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> this Court declared that the third-party witnesses required by Section 21 must be present as early as the time of apprehension: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 21 plainly requires the apprehending team to conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and the photographing of the same immediately after seizure and confiscation. In addition, the inventory must be done in the presence of the accused, his counsel, or representative, a representative of the DOJ, the media, and an elected public official, who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. </p> <p> The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension. And only if this is not practicable, the IRR allows that the inventory and photographing could be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team. <i>By the same token, however, this also means that the three required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of apprehension</i>—a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity. Simply put, the buy-bust team has enough time and opportunity to bring with them said witnesses. </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> <i>The presence of the three witnesses must be secured not only during the inventory but more importantly at the time of the warrantless arrest. It is at this point in which the presence of the three witnesses is most needed, as it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would belie any doubt as to the source, identity, and integrity of the seized drug.</i> If the buy-bust operation is legitimately conducted, the presence of the insulating witnesses would also controvert the usual defense of frame-up as the witnesses would be able to testify that the buy-bust operation and inventory of the seized drugs were done in their presence in accordance with Section 21 of RA 9165. </p> <p> <i>The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so — and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished — does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs.</i> </p> <p> <i>To restate, the presence of the three witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with at the time of the warrantless arrest; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> Here, the absence of witnesses during seizure and marking casts reasonable doubt on the actual origin and identity of the drugs introduced in evidence as those allegedly seized from accused-appellant. Ultimately, this same absence casts reasonable doubt on accused-appellant's guilt for the offenses with which he is charged. </p><p> The prosecution maintains that after the alleged confiscation of items from accused-appellant, the buy-bust team went inside their vehicle parked near the place of arrest, and there did the marking. This claim alone acknowledges the ostensibly clandestine conduct of the police officers. Moreover, there is no independent guarantee on the integrity of whatever it was that the police officers did next. Other than them and their self-serving assurances, no other person could attest to how they conducted themselves at the place of the arrest and, ultimately, in the isolation of their own vehicle. </p><p> It was also only at the police station that Limbo, the Department of Justice representative, and Barangay Chair Latayan were called in to witness the inventory and photographing. It is clear that the required witnesses themselves had no personal knowledge of the supposed sale and subsequent apprehension, search, seizure, and marking. </p><p> Having third-party witnesses present only during the subsequent physical inventory and photographing renders the whole requirement of their presence futile. Securing third-party witnesses provides a layer of protection to the integrity of the items seized and forecloses any opportunity for the planting of dangerous drugs. Having their presence only at a very late stage reduces them to passive automatons, utilized merely to lend hollow legitimacy by belatedly affixing signatures on final inventory documents despite lacking authentic knowledge on the items confronting them. They are then reduced to rubberstamps, oblivious to how the dangers sought to be avoided by their presence may have already transpired. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> Prior to its amendment in 2014 by Republic Act No. 10640, Section 21(1) of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act required three (3) third­ party witnesses: a representative from the media, a representative from the Department of Justice, and an elected public official. All of these witnesses needed to be present here considering that the incidents of this case occurred in 2006, long before Republic Act No. 10640 took effect. </p><p> Even when overlooking the absence of third-party witnesses during the actual sale, arrest, search, seizure, and marking, it remains that the required witnesses were incomplete during the subsequent inventory and taking of photographs. No representative from the media was present alongside Limbo and Barangay Chair Latayan. Worse, while an inventory was done, such inventory had already been prepared by the time Limbo arrived at the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> These procedural lapses could only raise greater doubt on to the identity, origin, and integrity of the items allegedly seized from accused-appellant. </p><p align="center"> <b>V</b> </p><p> Noncompliance with Section 21 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act is not, in all cases, fatal to the prosecution. Conviction can ensue as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><p> Prior to the amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 10640, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165 provided some flexibility during the initial custody of the substance seized. It included the proviso that reads: "non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]"</p><p> However, to successfully invoke this saving clause, the prosecution bears the burden of first acknowledging procedural lapses and specifically plead justifiable grounds for these lapses. It must also plead specific safety measures taken in view of the deviations made from the chain of custody requirements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Specifically on the absence of the required witnesses, it must be alleged and demonstrated that earnest efforts were undertaken to secure their attendance. In <i>People v. Lim</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Earnest effort to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses must be proven. <i>People v. Ramos</i> requires: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not per se render the confiscated items inadmissible. However, a justifiable reason for such failure or a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses under Section 21 of RA 9165 must be adduced. In <i>People v. Umipang</i>, the Court held that the prosecution must show that earnest efforts were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the law for "a sheer statement that representatives were unavailable without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse." Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance. These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand knowing full well that they would have to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21 of RA 9165. As such, police officers are compelled not only to state reasons for their non-compliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstances, their actions were reasonable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Here, the prosecution has never bothered to prove, let alone plead, any justifiable ground accounting for the buy-bust team's deviation from the prescribed procedure. All it offered were sweeping and self-serving assurances of compliance and integrity. These cannot serve to condone the police officers' deviation. </p><p> Noncompliance with the chain of custody requirements raises doubts on the credibility of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and consequently, on the very claim that an offense penalized by the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> The prosecution's failure to establish beyond reasonable doubt the critical elements of the offenses charged against accused-appellant can only serve to warrant his acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the September 29, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
