Their conversation lasted for an hour and a half. On&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; information,&nbsp; PCI&nbsp; Enguerra&nbsp; directed&nbsp; PO1 Montebon and PO1 Veraño together with their informant to conduct a surveillance&nbsp; at Sitio&nbsp; Sapa-Sapa at around 8:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the evening, wherein the said policemen ascertained that the information they received was accurate.<br><br>Upon their return at the police station, PCI Enguerra conducted a briefing attended by the confidential agent, PO1 Montebon, PO1 Veraño and SPO4&nbsp; Tumakay wherein the group hatched a plan to conduct a buy bust&nbsp; operation&nbsp; against&nbsp; [Escaran].&nbsp; PO1&nbsp; Veraño&nbsp; was&nbsp; designated&nbsp; as&nbsp; the poseur-buyer and he was given x x x pre-marked two x x x P100.00 peso bills furnished by SPO1&nbsp; Enri[q]uez who affixed his signature on the upper left portion of the said bills.<br><br>After their briefing, at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, on board the service vehicle, Mobile 9, PO1 Montebon, PO1 Veraño and SPO1 Enriquez together with the confidential agent went to the designated area. Twenty minutes after the group arrived, they were met by [Escaran,] who asked PO1 Veraño if he would be interested to buy shabu to which the latter answered in the affirmative. PO1 Veraño then told [Escaran] that he would buy worth P200.00[;] thereafter the latter handed to the former two [2] packs of shabu.<br><br>After that, PO1 Veraño and PO1 Montebon introduced themselves as policemen and [arrested Escaran] who was thereafter appraised of his constitutional rights. When [Escaran] was frisked by PO1 Montebon, the policeman was able to recover an additional four [4] packs of shabu from the right front pocket of [Escaran]'s trousers.<br><br>The police officers then brought [Escaran] to the police station. The two [2] packets from the sale were then marked as "Alex-1" and "Alex-2" while the four [4] packets obtained from the search were marked as "AET- 1"&nbsp; to "AET-4".&nbsp; The contraband&nbsp; were then brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<br><br>The&nbsp; Chemistry&nbsp; Report&nbsp; [p]repared&nbsp; by&nbsp; [PSI&nbsp; Salinas]&nbsp; on&nbsp; the items seized from [Escaran] yielded positive results for shabu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>For his defense, Escaran denied the charges and narrated that:<br><blockquote>x x x At around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of March 21, 2004, [Escaran] was told by his co-worker Arman to wait for him by the bamboo groove near his house so that they could go together to work. They were supposed to report at 9:30 o'clock (sic) in the evening at the back portion of Sitio Sapa-Sapa. [Escaran] had been under the employ of one Titing as a butcher of chickens for the past four [4] years prior to his arrest. Two minutes into waiting for Arman, the latter arrived and told [Escaran] to wait further as he was going to sharpen his knife and if their other companions would arrive before him [Arman] then [Escaran] should go with them.<br><br>[Escaran] decided to wait further as their other companions were not yet in sight. A while later he noticed four [4] persons who approached him and asked where they could buy shabu. [Escaran] replied that he does not sell shabu and directed the persons to go further back out and he saw the group heading towards the store. Thereafter, one of the persons in the group came back to him and asked him to accompany them because they were not familiar with the place. [Escaran] declined and said that he was waiting&nbsp; for his companions.&nbsp; The&nbsp; person&nbsp; left&nbsp; him&nbsp; alone.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp; no companions&nbsp; in sight, another person from the group was able to come back and asked him again to accompany them but then again he declined. This infuriated the person who retorted "Why will you not accompany us? We are just requesting you to accompany us."<br><br>Undaunted, another one from the group whom he identified as Montebon introduced himself saying "Bay, we are policemen. You just accompany&nbsp; us where we can buy shabu." But [Escaran] was adamant saying he could not do that because he was waiting for his companions. Montebon then replied[,] "It's&nbsp; up to you, you might regret it", after he said that he returned to his companions.<br><br>The four of them, then approached him and ordered him to stand up. [Escaran] asked why he was ordered around but they retorted that he was hard-headed. Suddenly, one of the four&nbsp; people drew his gun and aimed&nbsp; at&nbsp; [Escaran]&nbsp; saying[,]&nbsp; "If&nbsp; you&nbsp; only&nbsp; had&nbsp; accompanied&nbsp; us,&nbsp; this [would] not have happened to you.["] Thereafter, he was dragged in a corner and was told to board the vehicle. He was later on brought to the Command Office where he was asked to point to them [policemen] the house of a certain Dennis and was even told that should he supply them the information, the four will set him free. Not knowing any person in the name of Dennis, he could not give them an answer.<br><br>They left him for a while in a small room and a few short minutes later, they brought him outside and made him sit on a table near the computer and was told: "do you see those packs? Those 6 packs will be yours if you will not tell us." He pleaded to them and told them that he was still on probation but they were just laughing at him. He was later on locked up and brought to Precinct l.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br><i>Ruling of the RTC</i><br><br>The RTC found Escaran guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165 and sentenced him to life imprisonment and an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years as minimum term to twelve (12) years and one (1) day as maximum term, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The RTC found that all the elements of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs were established by the prosecution and that there was regularity in the performance of official duties by the members of the buy-bust team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The RTC further held that Escaran's&nbsp; defense of denial is not sufficient to overcome the positive assertion of the police officers that Escaran was caught selling <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><i>Ruling of the CA</i><br><br>On appeal, the CA, in the assailed Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; sustained Escaran's conviction. The CA agreed with the RTC that all the elements of the crimes charged were established by the straightforward and categorical declaration of the prosecution's&nbsp; witnesses, especially since the defense did not adduce any evidence showing that the police officers in the buy-bust operation had any ill motive to make false charges against Escaran.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The CA further held that the failure of the police officers to strictly comply with the provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165 is of no moment since the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs seized from Escaran were preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The CA, however, modified the penalties imposed upon Escaran that in Criminal Case No. DU-11130, Escaran was further ordered to pay P500,000.00&nbsp; as fine; while in Criminal Case No. DU-11131, Escaran was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years with all the accessory penalties provided by law and ordered to pay P300,000.00 as fine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Hence, the instant appeal.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br>Whether the CA erred in sustaining Escaran's conviction for violation of Sections&nbsp; 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The appeal is meritorious. Escaran is accordingly acquitted.<br><br>In cases involving dangerous drugs, the confiscated drug constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is essential, therefore, that the identity and integrity of the seized drug be established with moral certainty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubt on its identity, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drug is seized up to its presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In this regard, Section 21,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Article II of RA 9165, the applicable law at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, outlines the procedure which the police officers should strictly follow to preserve the integrity of the confiscated drugs and/or paraphernalia used as evidence. The provision requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed <u><b>immediately&nbsp; after seizure or confiscation;</b></u>&nbsp; and (2) the physical&nbsp; inventory and photographing must be done <u><b>in the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of (a) the accused&nbsp; or his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the Department&nbsp; of Justice&nbsp; (DOJ)</b></u>,&nbsp; all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same and the seized drugs must be turned&nbsp; over&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Police&nbsp; (PNP) Crime Laboratory&nbsp; within&nbsp; twenty-four&nbsp; (24)&nbsp; hours from confiscation for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension.&nbsp; It is only when&nbsp; the same is not&nbsp; practicable that the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 allow the inventory and photographing to be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team. In this connection, this also means that the three (3) required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of apprehension — <u><b>a&nbsp; requirement&nbsp; that can easily&nbsp; be complied with by&nbsp; the&nbsp; buy-bust&nbsp; team&nbsp; considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity</b></u>.&nbsp; Verily, a buy-bust team normally has enough time to gather and bring with them the said witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court, however, has clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; and, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 does not <i>ipso facto</i>&nbsp; render&nbsp; the&nbsp; seizure&nbsp; and custody over the items void&nbsp; and&nbsp; invalid. However,&nbsp; this is with the caveat that the prosecution still needs to satisfactorily prove that: <u><b>(a) there is justifiable ground for the non­compliance;&nbsp; and (b)&nbsp; the&nbsp; integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly&nbsp; preserved</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It has been repeatedly emphasized by the Court that the prosecution has the positive duty to explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Without any justifiable explanation, which must be proven as a fact,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> is unreliable, and the acquittal of the accused should follow on the ground that his guilt has not been shown beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><i>The police officers failed to comply<br>with&nbsp; the&nbsp; mandatory&nbsp; requirements<br>under Section 21.</i><br><br>In this case, the Court finds that the police officers failed to comply with the prescribed chain of custody rule, thereby putting into question the identity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Escaran.<br><br><i>First</i>, while PO1 Montebon<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; and PO1 Veraño<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> narrated that SPO1 Enriquez marked the items recovered from Escaran, there is no evidence as to when and where the seized drugs were marked and whether the marking was made in Escaran's&nbsp; presence. In <i>People v.

It must be noted that the police&nbsp; officers&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case&nbsp; received&nbsp; the&nbsp; information&nbsp; that&nbsp; Escaran&nbsp; was allegedly peddling drugs at around 7:00 in the evening and was even able to conduct a surveillance at the place identified by the confidential agent before the buy-bust was operationalized at around 9:00 in the evening.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[46]</sup></font>&nbsp; Thus, the police officers had more than ample time to comply with the requirements established by law; and yet they did not exert even the slightest effort to secure the attendance of the required witnesses.<br><br>Moreover, contrary to the findings of the CA, the records reveal that <u><b>gaps&nbsp; exist</b></u>&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; chain&nbsp; of&nbsp; custody&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized&nbsp; items&nbsp; which&nbsp; create reasonable doubt as to the identity and integrity thereof.&nbsp; To establish an unbroken chain of custody, "[i]t is necessary that every person who touched the seized item describe how and from whom he or she received it; where and what happened to it while in the witness' possession; its condition when received and at the time it was delivered to the next link in the chain."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This requirement was, however, not complied in this case.<br><br>PO1 Veraño testified that the six (6) plastic sachets confiscated from Escaran were turned over to PCI Enguerra, who later on delivered the same to&nbsp; SPO1&nbsp;&nbsp; Enriquez&nbsp; to&nbsp; prepare&nbsp; the&nbsp; request&nbsp; for&nbsp; laboratory&nbsp; examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Further, the Request for Laboratory examination showed that the confiscated drugs were delivered to the crime laboratory by PO1 Veraño.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> However, the Court does not see from the records the details on how the specimens were handled from the time they were handed to PCI Enguerra to the time they were delivered to SPO1 Enriquez until they were returned to PO1 Veraño and&nbsp; submitted to PSI&nbsp; Salinas&nbsp; for&nbsp; examination. The&nbsp; testimonies of PO1 Veraño and PO1 Montebon were sorely lacking on these details.<br><br>Similarly, PSI Salinas did not testify on how she handled the seized items during examination and before it was transferred to the court -which testimony is required to ensure that that there was no change in the condition of the seized drug and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession while in her custody. Instead of the forensic chemist turning over the&nbsp;&nbsp; substance&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; court&nbsp; and&nbsp; testifying,&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties&nbsp;&nbsp; merely&nbsp; made stipulations, which do not in any way prove how the drugs were handled by said chemist. In other words, the records do not indicate how the identity and integrity of seized drugs were preserved from the time they were confiscated from Escaran&nbsp; to&nbsp; the time they were turned over to the&nbsp; next responsible person until they were offered in court as evidence.<br><br>As the&nbsp; seized&nbsp; drugs themselves are the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime charged, it is of utmost importance that there be no doubt or uncertainty as to their identity and integrity. The State, and no other party, has the responsibi11ty to explain the lapses in the procedures taken to preserve the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs. Without the explanation by the State, the evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the <i>corpus delicti </i> is unreliable,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> as&nbsp; in this case.
