The case was docketed as G.R. No. 235031, entitled "<i>Dr. Mariano C. De Jesus and Hermogena A. Bautista, for themselves and as attorneys-in-fact of other officials and employees of the BulSU v. COA</i>." </p><p> On January 15, 2019, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> ordering the consolidation of G.R. No. 226319 and G.R. No. 235031. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issues</b> </p><p> The main issue raised for the Court's resolution rests on whether or not the COA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in affirming ND Nos. 13-001-164(12) to 13-042-164(12), and consequently, in declaring the petitioners-employees and the petitioners-officials personally liable to refund the Accomplishment Incentive Award.</p><p> Mainly, the petitioners-employees and petitioners-officials both contend that the COA erred in ordering the refund of the Accomplishment Incentive Award. They aver that the BulSU BoR was empowered, under Section 4(d) of R.A. No. 8292, to use the STF for instruction, research, extension or any other program or project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Likewise, they contend that COA Circular No. 2000-002 provides among others, that the STF shall be used to pay authorized allowances and fringe benefits to teachers and students who render services to the school. Concomitantly, the economic benefits accruing in favor of the BulSU personnel must be treated as part of the university's academic programs, as the university's primary functions cannot be performed in the absence of the personnel who teach, conduct research and render extension services. Accordingly, the petitioners-employees and petitioners-officials assert that they should not be ordered to refund the Accomplishment Incentive Award as they believed in good faith that the payment thereof was authorized under existing rules and regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> In addition, the petitioners-officials, in G.R.

No. 235031, the COA points out that the petition for review filed by the petitioners-officials before the COA was filed beyond the reglementary period for taking an appeal against a COA ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> While in G.R. No. 226319, the COA prays for the outright dismissal of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, due to the failure of the petitioners-employees to file a Motion for Reconsideration against COA Decision No. 2016-096.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> Anent the substantive issues, the COA avers that the grant of the Accomplishment Incentive Award contravenes Article IX-B, Section 8 of the 1987 Constitution and the Salary Standardization Law. Furthermore, the COA maintains that the STF may only be used for expenditures pertaining to instruction, research and extension, or other programs or projects related thereto. The phrase "other programs or projects" should be interpreted to mean only those related to instruction, research and extension. Finally, the COA argues that COA Circular No. 2000-002 pertains to allowances and benefits that are authorized. Considering that the Accomplishment Incentive Award was not authorized under the law, all the petitioners must be ordered to refund the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court </b> </p><p><b><i>The instant petitions are bereft of merit.</i></b></p><p> The Court shall first resolve the procedural issues raised before delving into the merits of the case. </p><p> <b>I.

It was also on the same date that they paid the required filing fees, as evidenced by Official Receipt No. 1010188K.

No. 8292 grants the governing boards of state universities and colleges the power to use the STF for any charges or expenses necessary for instruction, research, extension and other programs or projects of the university or college. </p><p> It must be stressed, however, that the authority given to the governing boards of state universities and colleges is not plenary and absolute, but is subject to limitations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In <i>Benguet State University v. COA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the Court warned against the state university's unbridled exercise of powers, and tempered its right to indiscriminately grant allowances to its employees under the guise of academic freedom. The Court stressed that academic freedom shall not serve as a warrant for any untrammeled authority to disburse funds and grant additional benefits sans statutory basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> Besides, the law clearly states that the STF may only be used for expenses necessary for instruction, research and extension. The incentive granted by the BulSU does not in any way relate to any particular academic program or project pertaining to instruction, research, or extension. In fact, all that the BulSU officers latch on to is the broad and vague excuse that the recipients aided in the university's goal of achieving excellence. An automatic grant of incentives on shallow and unsubstantiated grounds will certainly lead to the hemorrhaging of government funds, which the Court shall not countenance. </p><p> Neither may the award be regarded as part of the catch-all phrase "other programs/projects" of the BulSU. Notably, the basic statutory construction principle of<em> ejusdem generis</em> states that where a general word or phrase follows an enumeration of particular and specific words of the same class, the general word or phrase must be construed to include, or to be restricted to things akin to, resembling, or of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, the phrase "other programs/projects" must be interpreted to pertain to those relating to instruction, research and extension. </p><p> In fact, in the seminal cases of <em>Benguet State University</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and <em>Ricardo E. Rotoras, President, Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges v.

Such directive is in accord with Article 22 of the Civil Code, which states that, "[e]very person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This principle of unjust enrichment applies when, "(i) a person is unjustly benefited; and (ii) such benefit is derived at the expense of or with damages to another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> This strict stance is evident from the Court's recent pronouncements in Rotoras,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> <i>James Arthur T.

Neither would the defense be available to the rank-and-file should the allowance or benefit have been the subject of collective negotiation agreement negotiations. Furthermore, the obligation to return for the rank-and-file shall be limited only to what they have actually received. They may, subject to [COA] approval, agree to the terms of payment for the return of the funds which have been disallowed. For the approving board members or officers, however, the nature of the obligation to return whether it be solidary or not - depends on the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Equally important, neither will a plea of innocence nor the absence of fraud excuse the recipients. Likewise, the benefits conferred by mistake, fraud, coercion, or request shall be held by the payees in trust for the government, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Finally, the payees received the disallowed benefits with the mistaken belief that they were entitled to the same. If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes. A constructive trust is substantially an appropriate remedy against unjust enrichment, it is raised by equity in respect of property, which has been acquired by fraud, or where although acquired originally without fraud, it is against equity that it should be retained by the person holding it. In fine, the payees are considered as trustees of the disallowed amounts, as although they committed no fraud in obtaining these benefits, it is against equity and good conscience for them to continue holding on to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In the case at bar, the petitioners-officials and petitioners-employees received the Accomplishment Incentive Award pursuant to Board Resolution No. 39, which was an illegal and <i>ultra vires</i> act of the BulSU's BOR.
