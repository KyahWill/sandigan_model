Consortium (Consultant for brevity) entered into an Agreement for Consulting Services (Agreement for, brevity) for the NAIA Terminal 2 Development Project on April 15, 1994. The Agreement, covering 795 man-months of consulting services, commenced on July 1, 1994. It originally assumed a total duration of 53 months that included a 14-month post construction services up to November 30, 1998. The construction of the Project was originally estimated to take 26 months from August 1, 1995 to September 30, 1997, followed by a 12-month defect liability period.<br><br>However, the duration of the services was extended and the number of man-months increased, due to a prolonged process of pre­qualification, bidding and awarding stages; delayed Department of Environment and Natural Resources approval and Contractor's site possession, as well as numerous additional construction works.<br><br>The total duration of the consulting services was, thus, extended from 53 to 69 months or a total of 1,083.81 man-months. The extension was covered by three (3) Supplementary Agreements (SAs) entered into by the MIAA and the Consultant.<br><br>On November 24, 1999, the then Corporate Auditor of MIAA issued ND No. (FMT) 99-00-04 finding the Agreement's remuneration cost of P41,784,850.00 (excluding expatriates) excessive because it was 19.80% above the corresponding COA estimated remuneration cost of P34,876,915.00. Then General Manager Antonio P. Gana of MIAA in his undated letter to COA, requested reconsideration of the ND based on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><ol><li>That the cost of Consulting Services was obtained after detailed negotiations, embodied in an Agreement and the same was approved by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) and concurred in by Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC); and<br><br></li><li>That under Section 9.3 of the NEDA Guidelines, the ceiling for contingency can be negated by any existing and future commitments with respect to the selection of consultants financed partly or wholly with funds from international financial institutions. Thus, considering that the consulting services were 100% funded by JBIC and in view of other previous JBIC projects, the 10% contingency was accepted by MIAA and the OGCC and concurred in by the JBIC; that the provision of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) Loan Agreement should govern the expenditure of contingency and that the contingency is not a committed payment to the consultant upon execution of the Agreement, but may be used wholly or partially, or not at all depending on the circumstances.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Consequently, the MIAA Corporate Auditor referred, through the former Director of the then Corporate Audit Office (CAO) II, this Commission, the above request to the COA Technical Services Office (TSO), for further evaluation.<br><br>In the meantime, on January 25, 2000, MIAA and the Consultant entered into a fourth SA for the extension of another 8 months, for a total of 77 months or up to November 30, 2000. The corresponding number of professional man-months increased to 1,221.65.<br><br>The COA-TSO, in response to the request for reconsideration, conducted a re-evaluation of the Agreement and thereafter reversed its earlier stand on the excessive remuneration cost, but as regards to the issue of the contingency, the COA-TSO requested the then MIAA Corporate Auditor to validate the payments charged to contingency.<br><br>Thereafter, on August 17, 2000, the then MIAA Corporate Auditor lifted and settled the disallowed amount of P6,907,935.00 after the same was found reasonable based on the COA-TSO Re-evaluation Report dated June 29, 2000.<br><br>On October 18, 2001, the then MIAA Corporate Auditor re­submitted the request for reconsideration, together with the COA-TSO validation and opined that the sum of payments charged to contingency was within the ceiling equivalent to 5% of the amount of the contract as prescribed under the NEDA Guidelines. He stressed that of ¥1,493,497,905.00 and P113,061,248.01 actually paid by MIAA to the Consultant, ¥36,349,705.00 and P2,752,610.77 representing 2.49% and 2.495%, respectively, or a total of 4.985% of the contract cost was charged to contingency. Moreover, the then MIAA Corporate Auditor averred that all four SAs entered into by MIAA and the Consultant were reviewed and found in order as to their technical aspects by the COA-TSO.<br><br>Thereafter, pursuant to COA Memorandum No. 2002-039 dated July 11, 2002, the former Assistant Director of then Cluster IV-Industrial and Area Development and Regulatory, Corporate Government Sector (CGS), this Commission, forwarded the instant request to COA LAO-­Corporate for appropriate action.<br><br>On November 21, 2008, COA LAO-Corporate issued the assailed decision denying the remaining disallowance of ¥53,697,150.00 foreign portion and P3,215,267.50 local portion under ND No. (FMT) 99-00-04 dated November 24, 1999.<br><br>It likewise issued the ND No. 2008-018 dated November 21, 2008 for the additional disallowance of ¥344,425,855.00 and P42,325,363.04 as mentioned in the decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>To assail the NDs, the petitioner appealed to the COA by petition for review, which ultimately denied the appeal upon the following ratiocination, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The exemption mentioned in Section 9.3 of the NEDA Guidelines is only in respect to the selection of consultants and does not include exemption from the 5% ceiling on contingency. Also, a careful reading of Section 6.10 of the NEDA Guidelines would show that the 5% ceiling of contingency was written in a mandatory manner by the use of the verb "shall," to wit:<br><blockquote>6.10 Contingency<br><br>6.10.1 Payments in respect of costs which would exceed the estimates set forth in Section 6.1 may be chargeable to the contingency amounts in the respective estimates only if such costs are approved by the agency concerned prior to its being incurred and provided, further, that they shall be used only in line with the unit rates and costs specified in the contract and in strict compliance with the project needs. <b>Contingency amount shall not exceed 5% of the amount of the contract.</b> (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>It should be noted that the contingency amount is included in the contract cost for the purpose of facilitating the availability of funds for future requirements during the lifetime of the contract (e.g. per Section 2.04 of the Agreement, for performance of additional work to be covered by an SA). For such budgetary purposes, the NEDA Guidelines provide a ceiling of 5% of the Cost of Services.<br><br>It is shown that the total actual amount charged to the contingency and paid to the Consultant exceeded the 5% ceiling, thus: <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"><div align="center">Actual amounts disbursed for SA 1 to SA 4 and charged to contingency</div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center">Contingency amount per Agreement</div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center">5% Contingency limit per NEDA Guidelines</div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center">Excess amount disbursed</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">¥451,820,155.00</div></td><td><div align="center">¥107,394,300.00</div></td><td><div align="center">¥53,697,150.00</div></td><td><div align="center">¥398,123,005.00</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">P48,755,898.04</div></td><td><div align="center">P6,430,535.00</div></td><td><div align="center">P3,215,267.50</div></td><td><div align="center">P45,540,630.54</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Petitioner's claim that the actual disbursements from the contingency amount were only ¥36,349,705.00 and P2,752,610.77 which are 2.49% and 2.495% of the Revised Cost of Services in Yen and Pesos, respectively, does not appear factual since he did not include the portion of the cost of the SA Nos. 1 to 4. It was made to appear that the remuneration cost and reimbursement cost for the extension were part of the original Cost of Services instead of the amount being charged to contingencies as provided for in Section 2.04 of the original Agreement for Consulting Services of the parties. Section 2.04 states that:<br><br><u>Extension of Services Under Supplemental Agreement</u><br><br>The Services of Consultant may be extended for the performance of additional work as provided for in Sections 7.05 and 7.07 hereof. For each extension of the Services, a supplemental agreement shall be executed stipulating the scope and remuneration for the extended services.<br><br>The terms and conditions of the additional services under the supplemental agreement shall be also governed by this Agreement. <b>Remuneration to Consultant for the additional man-months shall be chargeable against Contingencies</b> and shall be governed by the provisions of the Agreement.

On its part, the COA insists that the loan agreement did not carry any stipulation referencing the provisions to international law; hence, domestic law, particularly the NEDA Guidelines, should apply as to the 5% ceiling on contingency.<br><br>The submission of the petitioner is upheld.<br><br>Pursuant to the pronouncement in <i>Abaya v. Ebdane, supra</i>, a loan agreement executed in conjunction with the Exchange of Notes between the Philippine Government and a foreign government is an executive agreement, and should be governed by international law. This pronouncement has been consistently applied in succeeding rulings, including those in <i>DBM Procurement Service v.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Consequently, we see no justification to treat Loan Agreement No. PH-136 differently, particularly as its pre-ambular paragraph expressly made reference to the Exchange of Notes between the Philippines and Japan on August 16, 1993, to wit:<br><blockquote>Loan Agreement No. PH-136, dated August 19, 1993, between THE OVERSEAS ECONOMIC COOPERATION FUND and THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES<br><br>In the light of the contents of the Exchange of Notes between the Government of Japan and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines dated August 16, 1993, concerning Japanese loans to be extended with a view to promoting the economic development and stabilization efforts of the Republic of the Philippines,<br><br>THE OVERSEAS ECONOMIC COOPERATION FUND (hereinafter referred to as "the Fund") and THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (hereinafter referred to as "the Borrower") herewith conclude the following Loan Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "the Loan Agreement", which includes all agreements supplemental hereto).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>We point out that Loan Agreement No. PH-136, which financed the NAIA Terminal 2 Development Project, stemmed from the August 16, 1993 Exchange of Notes whereby the Government of Japan agreed to extend loans in favor of the Philippines to promote economic development and stability. Thusly, the loan agreement was the adjunct of the Exchange of Notes and should thus be treated as an executive agreement. In other words, international law should apply in the implementation and construction of the terms and conditions of Loan Agreement No. PH-136. Accordingly, the Philippine Government was bound to faithfully comply with the provisions of the loan agreements in accordance with the doctrine of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>. Needless to indicate, the doctrine has been incorporated in the 1987 Constitution pursuant to Section 2 of its Article II, which declares:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations.<br></blockquote>Logically, the Agreement for Consulting Services (ACS) executed by and between the petitioner and the ADP-JAC Consortium, being a mere accessory of Loan Agreement No. PH-136, should likewise be treated as an executive agreement, and construed and interpreted in accordance with the doctrine of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>. The Court elucidated on the nature of the intimate relationship between the principal loan agreement and the accessory agreement in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Atlanta Industries, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> opining:<br><blockquote>As may be palpably observed, the terms and conditions of Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH, being a project-based and government­ guaranteed loan facility, were <b>incorporated and made part of the SLA</b> that was subsequently entered into by Land Bank with the City Government of Iligan. Consequently, this means that the SLA cannot be treated as an independent and unrelated contract but as a conjunct of, or having a joint and simultaneous occurrence with, Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH. <b>Its nature and consideration, being a mere accessory contract of Loan Agreement No. 4833-PH, are thus the same as that of its principal contract from which it receives life and without which it cannot exist as an independent contract.</b> Indeed, the accessory follows the principal; and, concomitantly, accessory contracts should not be read independently of the main contract. Hence, as Land Bank correctly puts it, the SLA has attained indivisibility with the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement through the incorporation of each other's terms and conditions such that the character of one has likewise become the character of the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>A similar treatment should be extended to the three Supplemental Agreements entered into by the petitioner and the ADP-JAC Consortium.<br><br>Accordingly, the COA could not validly insist that the NEDA Guidelines, particularly that on applying a 5% interest on contingency, should find application because the contracting parties did not stipulate on the applicable law. The pronouncement in <i>Abaya v. Ebdane, supra</i>, and its progeny that international law applies in interpreting and implementing contracts executed in conjunction with executive agreements was controlling. No express stipulation by the contracting parties to that effect was necessary.<br><br>Having settled the issue of the governing law in interpreting and implementing the agreements, we next determine whether or not the COA properly disallowed the amounts disbursed for the additional man-months for the consulting services as provided in the supplemental agreements.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Let us first review the background on how the supplemental agreements came about, and look at the significance of each in the completion of the NAIA Terminal 2 Development Project.<br><br>The petitioner and ADP-JAC Consortium executed the ACS for the NAIA Terminal 2 Development Project on April 15, 1994.

Considering that ND No. (FMT) 99-00-44 only disallowed ¥53 million and P3.2 million, the COA ordered an additional disallowance of ¥344 million and P42 million to be charged against the liable officials of the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The Court finds the action of the COA not only erroneous but also in contravention of the doctrine of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i> and, most importantly, contrary to the intention of the parties in entering into the supplemental agreements.<br><br>To reiterate, the applicable law in interpreting and construing the agreements should be the canons of international law, particularly the doctrine of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>. Yet, in affirming the NDs, the COA proposed that the Government negate its accession to the executive agreements without any valid justification. Obviously, this approach should not be adopted. In <i>Agustin v. Edu</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> we stressed that "[i]t is not for this country to repudiate a commitment to which it had pledged its word. The concept of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i> stands in the way of such an attitude, which is, moreover, at war with the principle of international morality."<br><br>Properly viewed, the petitioner and the ADP-JAC Consortium, by executing the supplemental agreements, intended to modify the original consultancy services agreement with respect to the estimated man-months in order to complete the project, and to institute the necessary adjustments in the total cost of services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This is the only conclusion to be arrived at in view of the parties' choice of the word "<i>revised</i>" in Clause 2.03 found in each of the supplemental agreements<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> in their reference to the estimated total number of man-months corresponding to the delays incurred in the completion of the project.

Hence, only the extra man-months in excess of what had been finally agreed upon, and the unforeseen expenditures incurred by the parties in connection with the project should be charged against the contingency. In this regard, we remind that parties to a contract are not forever locked unto its terms, but have the right to amend their covenant by mutual consent. Thus, the parties to an existing contract may, by mutual assent, modify it, provided the modification does not contravene the law or public policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]<br></sup><br>We do not find anything irregular and unlawful in the manner that the petitioner and the ADP-JAC Consortium executed the supplemental agreements.

By <i>grave abuse of discretion</i> is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The burden is on the part of the petitioner to prove not merely reversible error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the public respondent issuing the impugned order.

The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations.<br></blockquote>Transformation of international law is found in Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution, which describes the process by which international agreements or treaties become part of the law of the land:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><blockquote>SECTION 21. No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.<br></blockquote>The transformation method was discussed in <i>David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><blockquote>Treaties are "international agreement[s] concluded between states in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation." Under Article VII, Section 21 of the 1987 Constitution, treaties require concurrence by the Senate before they become binding:<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.<br></blockquote>The Senate's ratification of a treaty makes it legally effective and binding by transformation. It then has the force and effect of a statute enacted by Congress. In <i>Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines v. Duque III, et al.</i>:<br><blockquote>Under the 1987 Constitution, international law can become part of the sphere of domestic law either by transformation or incorporation. <i>The transformation method requires that an international law be transformed into a domestic law through a constitutional mechanism such as local legislation.</i> The incorporation method applies when, by mere constitutional declaration, international law is deemed to have the force of domestic law.<br><br><i>Treaties become part of the law of the land through transformation pursuant to Article VII Section 21 of the Constitution.&nbsp; . . . Thus, treaties or conventional international law must go through a process prescribed by the Constitution for it to be transformed into municipal law that can be applied to domestic conflicts. . . .</i><br></blockquote>Following ratification by the Senate, no further action, legislative or otherwise, is necessary. Thereafter, the whole of government - including the judiciary - is duty-bound to abide by the treaty, consistent with the maxim <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Senate concurrence is necessary before treaties and international agreements become binding as law. This is emphasized in the history of Article VII, 21 of the Constitution, as discussed in my separate concurring opinion in <i>Intellectual Property Association of the Philippines v. Ochoa</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><blockquote>Tracing the history of Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution reveals, through the "[c]hanges or retention of language and syntax[,]" its congealed meaning. The pertinent constitutional provision has evolved into its current broad formulation to ensure that the power to enter into a binding international agreement is not concentrated on a single government department.<br><br>The 1935 Constitution recognized the President's power to enter into treaties. The exercise of this power was already limited by the requirement of legislative concurrence only with treaties, thus:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VII <br>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT<br></center><br>SECTION 11.&nbsp; . . .<br><br>. . . .&nbsp; <br><br>(7) The president shall have the power, with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the National Assembly <b><i>to make treaties</i></b>, and with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, he shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. He shall receive ambassadors and other ministers duly accredited to the Government of the Philippines. . . .<br></blockquote>The 1973 Constitution also requires legislative concurrence for the validity and effectiveness of a treaty, thus:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VIII<br>THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</center><br>SECTION 14. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution, <b><i>no treaty</i></b> shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by a majority of all the Members of the National Assembly. . . .</blockquote>The concurrence of the Batasang Pambansa was duly limited to treaties.<br><br>However, the first clause of this provision, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided[,]" leaves room for the exception to the requirement of legislative concurrence. Under Article XIV, Section 15 of the 1973 Constitution, requirements of national welfare and interest allow the President to enter into not only treaties but also international agreements without legislative concurrence, thus:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE XIV<br>THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE PATRIMONY OF THE NATION<br></center><br>. . . .<br><br>SECTION 15. Any provision of paragraph one, Section fourteen, Article Eight and of this Article notwithstanding, the Prime Minister may enter into international treaties or agreements as the national welfare and interest may require.<br></blockquote>This Court, in the recent case of <i>Saguisag v. Executive Secretary</i>, characterized this exception as having "left a large margin of discretion that the President could use to bypass the Legislature altogether." This Court noted this as "a departure from the 1935 Constitution, which explicitly gave the President the power to enter into treaties only with the concurrence of the [National Assembly]."<br><br>As in the 1935 Constitution, this exception is no longer present in the current formulation of the provision. The power and responsibility to enter into treaties is now shared by the executive and legislative departments. Furthermore, the role of the legislative department is expanded to cover not only treaties but international agreements in general as well[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Senate concurrence is required to maintain a healthy system of checks and balances, such that the power is shared by the executive and legislative branches:<br><blockquote>In discussing the power of the Senate to concur with treaties entered into by the President, this Court in <i>Bayan v. Zamora</i> remarked on the significance of this legislative power:<br><blockquote>For the role of the Senate in relation to treaties is essentially legislative in character; the Senate, as an independent body possessed of its own erudite mind, has the prerogative to either accept or reject the proposed agreement, and whatever action it takes in the exercise of its wide latitude of discretion, pertains to the wisdom rather than the legality of the act. <i>In this sense, the Senate partakes a principal, yet delicate, role in keeping the principles of <b>separation of powers</b> and of <b>checks and balances</b> alive and vigilantly ensures that these cherished rudiments remain true to their form in a democratic government such as ours. The Constitution thus animates, through this treaty ­concurring power of the Senate, a healthy system of checks and balances indispensable toward our nation 's pursuit of political maturity and growth.</i> True enough, rudimentary is the principle that matters pertaining to the wisdom of a legislative act are beyond the ambit and province of the courts to inquire.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote></blockquote>I likewise discussed that international agreements require Senate concurrence, especially if they involve political issues or national policies of a more permanent character:<br><blockquote>Therefore, having an option does not necessarily mean absolute discretion on the choice of international agreement. <i>There are certain national interest issues and policies covered by all sorts of international agreements, which may not be dealt with by the President alone. An interpretation that the executive has unlimited discretion to determine if an agreement requires senate concurrence not only runs counter to the principle of checks and balances; it may also render the constitutional requirement of senate concurrence meaningless[.]</i><br><br>Article VII, Section 21 does not limit the requirement of senate concurrence to treaties alone. It may cover other international agreements, including those classified as executive agreements, if: (1) they are more permanent in nature; (2) their purposes go beyond the executive function of carrying out national policies and traditions; and (3) they amend existing treaties or statutes.<br><br>As long as the subject matter of the agreement covers political issues and national policies of a more permanent character, the international agreement must be concurred in by the Senate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Nonetheless, there are exceptions to the requirement of Senate concurrence, one (1) of which is an executive agreement.<br><br>Executive agreements are "international agreements that pertain to mere adjustments of detail that carry out well-entrenched national policies and traditions in line with the functions of the Executive. It includes enforcement of existing and valid treaties where the provisions are clear. It involves arrangements that are of a temporary nature."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They do not amend existing treaties, statutes, or the Constitution.<br><br>In my opinion in <i>Saguisag v. Ochoa, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> I differentiated an executive agreement from a treaty:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>[Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution] covers both "<i>treaty and international agreement</i>." Treaties are traditionally understood as international agreements entered into between states or by states with international organizations with international legal personalities. The deliberate inclusion of the term "international agreement" is the subject of a number of academic discussions pertaining to foreign relations and international law. Its addition cannot be mere surplus. Certainly, Senate concurrence should cover more than treaties.<br><br>That the President may enter into international agreements as chief architect of the Philippines' foreign policy has long been acknowledged. However, whether an international agreement is to be regarded as a treaty or as an executive agreement depends on the subject matter covered by and the temporal nature of the agreement. <i>Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading</i> differentiated international agreements that require Senate concurrence from those that do not:<br><blockquote>International agreements involving political issues or changes of national policy and those involving international arrangements of a permanent character usually take the form of treaties. But international agreements embodying <i>adjustments of detail</i> carrying out well-established national policies and traditions and those involving arrangements of a more or less <i>temporary</i> nature usually take the form of executive agreements. . . .<br></blockquote>Indeed, the distinction made in <i>Commissioner of Customs</i> in terms of international agreements must be clarified depending on whether it is viewed from an international law or domestic law perspective. Dean Merlin M. Magallona summarizes the differences between the two perspectives:<br><blockquote><i>From the standpoint of Philippine constitutional law, a treaty is to be distinguished from an executive agreement</i>, as the Supreme Court has done in <i>Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading</i> where it declares that "the concurrence of [the Senate] is required by our fundamental law in the making of 'treaties' . . . which are, however, distinct and different from 'executive agreements,' which may be validly entered into without such concurrence."<br><br><i>Thus, the distinction rests on the application of Senate concurrence as a constitutional requirement.</i><br><br><i>However, from the standpoint of international law, no such distinction is drawn.</i> Note that for purposes of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, in Article 2(1)(a) the term "treaty" is understood as "an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation." . . . The Philippines is a party to the Convention which is already in force. In the use of the term "treaty," Article 2(1)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations, which is not yet in force, the designation or appellation of the agreement also carries no legal significance. Provided the instruments possess the elements of an agreement under international law, they are to be taken equally as "treaty" without regard to the descriptive names by which they are designated, such as "protocol," "charter," "covenant," "exchange of notes," "<i>modus vivendi</i>," "convention," or "executive agreement."<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>Under Article 2 (2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, in relation to Article 2 (1) (a), the designation and treatment given to an international agreement is subject to the treatment given by the internal law of the state party. Paragraph 2 of Article 2 specifically safeguards the states' usage of the terms "treaty" and "international agreement" under their internal laws.<br><br>Within the context of our Constitution, the requirement for Senate concurrence in Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution connotes a special field of state policies, interests, and issues relating to foreign relations that the Executive cannot validly cover in an executive agreement:<br><blockquote>As stated above, an executive agreement is outside the coverage of Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution and hence not subject to Senate concurrence. However, the demarcation line between a treaty and an executive agreement as to the subject-matter or content of their coverage is ill-defined. The courts have not provided reliable guidelines as to the scope of executive-agreement authority in relation to treaty-making power.<br><br><i>If executive-agreement authority is un-contained, and if what may be the proper subject-matter of a treaty may also be included within the scope of executive-agreement power, the constitutional requirement of Senate concurrence could be rendered meaningless. The requirement could be circumvented by an expedient resort to executive agreement.</i><br><br><i>The definite provision for Senate concurrence in the Constitution indomitably signifies that there must be a regime of national interests, policies and problems which the Executive branch of the government cannot deal with in terms of foreign relations except through treaties concurred in by the Senate under Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution. The problem is how to define that regime, i.e., that which is outside the scope of executive-agreement power of the President and which exclusively belongs to treaty-making as subject to Senate concurrence. . . .</i><br></blockquote>Thus, Article VII, Section 21 may cover some but not all types of executive agreements. Definitely, the determination of its coverage does not depend on the nomenclature assigned by the President.<br><br><b><i>Executive agreements</i></b> are international agreements that pertain to mere adjustments of detail that carry out well-entrenched national policies and traditions in line with the functions of the Executive. It includes enforcement of existing and valid treaties where the provisions are clear. It involves arrangements that are of a temporary nature. More importantly, it does not amend existing treaties, statutes, or the Constitution.<br><br>In contrast, international agreements that are considered <b><i>treaties</i></b> under our Constitution involve key political issues or changes of national policy. These agreements are of a permanent character. It requires concurrence by at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28] </sup>(Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The Philippine government is duty bound to abide by its international engagements in good faith, regardless of whether the engagement is characterized as incorporated or transformed international law or whether it takes the form of an international executive agreement. This is the principle of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>.<br><br><i>Pacta sunt servanda</i>, among "the oldest and most fundamental rules in international law[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> means that "international agreements must be performed in good faith[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> A state is expected to make the necessary modifications in its laws to ensure that its valid international obligations are fulfilled. In <i>Tañada v. Angara</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><blockquote>This Court notes and appreciates the ferocity and passion by which petitioners stressed their arguments on this issue. However, while sovereignty has traditionally been deemed absolute and all-encompassing on the domestic level, it is however subject to restrictions and limitations voltuntarily agreed to by the Philippines, expressly or impliedly, as a member of the family of nations. Unquestionably, the Constitution did not envision a hermit-type isolation of the country from the rest of the world. In its Declaration of Principles and State Policies, the Constitution "adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land, and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation and amity, with all nations." By the doctrine of incorporation, the country is bound by generally accepted principles of international law, which are considered to be automatically part of our own laws. One of the oldest and most fundamental rules in international law is <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>-international agreements must be performed in good faith. "A treaty engagement is not a mere moral obligation but creates a legally binding obligation on the parties . . . A state which has contracted valid international obligations is bound to make in its legislations such modifications as may be necessary to ensure the fulfillment of the obligations undertaken."<br><br>By their inherent nature, treaties really limit or restrict the absoluteness of sovereignty. By their voluntary act, nations may surrender some aspects of their state power in exchange for greater benefits granted by or derived from a convention or pact. After all, states, like individuals, live with coequals, and in pursuit of mutually covenanted objectives and benefits, they also commonly agree to limit the exercise of their otherwise absolute rights. Thus, treaties have been used to record agreements between States concerning such widely diverse matters as, for example, the lease of naval bases, the sale or cession of territory, the termination of war, the regulation of conduct of hostilities, the formation of alliances, <i>the regulation of commercial relations</i>, the settling of claims, the laying down of rules governing conduct in peace and the establishment of international organizations. The sovereignty of a state therefore cannot in fact and in reality be considered absolute. Certain restrictions enter into the picture: (1) limitations imposed by the very nature of membership in the family of nations and (2) limitations imposed by treaty stipulations. As aptly put by John F. Kennedy, "Today, no nation can build its destiny alone. The age of self-sufficient nationalism is over. The age of interdependence is here."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>I agree that Loan Agreement No. PH-136 is an executive agreement. The circumstances by which it was executed are the same as those for the loan agreement in <i>Abaya v. Ebdane, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which this Court classified as an executive agreement. It held:<br><blockquote>The petitioners' arguments fail to persuade. The Court holds that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 taken in conjunction with the Exchange of Notes dated December 27, 1999 between the Japanese Government and the Philippine Government is an executive agreement.<br><br>To recall, Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 was executed by and between the JBIC and the Philippine Government pursuant to the Exchange of Notes executed by and between Mr. Yoshihisa Ara, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Philippines, and then Foreign Affairs Secretary Siazon, in behalf of their respective governments. The Exchange of Notes expressed that the two governments have reached an understanding concerning Japanese loans to be extended to the Philippines and that these loans were aimed at promoting our country's economic stabilization and development efforts.<br><br>. . . Under the circumstances, the JBIC may well be considered an adjunct of the Japanese Government. Further, Loan Agreement No. PH­ P204 is indubitably an integral part of the Exchange of Notes. It forms part of the Exchange of Notes such that it cannot be properly taken independent thereof.<br><br>In this connection, it is well to understand the definition of an "exchange of notes" under international law. The term is defined in the United Nations Treaty Collection in this wise:<br><blockquote>An "exchange of notes" is a record of a routine agreement that has many similarities with the private law contract. The agreement consists of the exchange of two documents, each of the parties being in the possession of the one signed by the representative of the other. Under the usual procedure, the accepting State repeats the text of the offering State to record its assent. The signatories of the letters may be government Ministers, diplomats or departmental heads. The technique of exchange of notes is frequently resorted to, either because of its speedy procedure, or, sometimes, to avoid the process of legislative approval.<br></blockquote>It is stated that "treaties, agreements, conventions, charters, protocols, declarations, memoranda of understanding, modus vivendi and <i>exchange of notes</i>" all refer to "international instruments binding at international law." It is further explained that -<br><blockquote>Although these instruments differ from each other by title, they all have common features and international law has applied basically the same rules to all these instruments. These rules are the result of long practice among the States, which have accepted them as binding norms in their mutual relations. Therefore, they are regarded as international customary law. Since there was a general desire to codify these customary rules, two international conventions were negotiated. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ("1969 Vienna Convention"), which entered into force on 27 January 1980, contains rules for treaties concluded between States. The 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations ("1986 Vienna Convention"), which has still not entered into force, added rules for treaties with international organizations as parties. Both the 1969 Vienna Convention and the 1986 Vienna Convention do not distinguish between the different designations of these instruments. Instead, their rules apply to all of those instruments as long as they meet the common requirements.<br></blockquote>Significantly, an exchange of notes is considered a form of an executive agreement, which becomes binding through executive action without the need of a vote by the Senate or Congress. The following disquisition by Francis B. Sayre, former United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, entitled "The Constitutionality of Trade Agreement Acts," quoted in <i>Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading</i>, is apropos:<br><blockquote>Agreements concluded by the President which fall short of treaties are commonly referred to as executive agreements and are no less common in our scheme of government than are the more formal instruments - treaties and conventions. <b>They sometimes take the form of exchange of notes and at other times that of more formal documents denominated "agreements" or "protocols".</b> The point where ordinary correspondence between this and other governments ends and agreements - whether denominated executive agreements or <b>exchange of notes</b> or otherwise - begin, may sometimes be difficult of ready ascertainment. It would be useless to undertake to discuss here the large variety of executive agreements as such, concluded from time to time. Hundreds of executive agreements, other than those entered into under the trade­ agreements act, have been negotiated with foreign governments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The same circumstances are present in this case. Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Philippine Government entered into Loan Agreement No. PH-136 in light of the governments' Exchange of Notes concerning Japanese loans to promote the economic development and stabilization efforts of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Thus, I agree that the Philippine Government is bound to comply with its stipulations in Loan Agreement No. PH-136, in accordance with the doctrine of <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>.<br><br>However, I differ as to the characterization of the added costs under the Supplementary Agreements. <i>Pacta sunt servanda</i> cannot simply be applied to these agreements at the expense of the express provisions in the Consultancy Agreement.<br><br>The Consultancy Agreement expressly states that it will be governed by Philippine law:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%"><div align="justify">7.01</div></td><td width="90%"> <div align="justify"><u>Laws of the Republic of the Philippines</u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify">The governing law of this Agreement shall be the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.

Furthermore, under Article 1370, "[i]f the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control."<br><br>In this case, nothing in the Supplementary Agreements states that the added costs will be charged to the original costs of the contract. Neither were express amendments made to the Consultancy Agreement's provisions on extensions, delays, and contingencies.<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that the express provisions of the Consultancy Agreement govern the agreement of the parties. Consequently, per the Consultancy Agreement, the added costs under the Supplementary Agreements ought to be charged to the contingency fund.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Consultancy Agreement does not provide a five percent (5%) limit as to the amount that can be charged against the contingency fund. To reiterate, the provision states: <br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%"><div align="justify">4.05</div></td><td width="90%"> <div align="justify"><u>Use of Contingency Amount</u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify">Payments in respect of costs which exceeds the estimates set forth in Annex D hereof may be chargeable to the Contingency amounts in the respective estimates, provided that such costs are approved by MIAA and concurred by OECF prior to their being incurred, and provided further that they shall be paid only at the unit rates and costs specified in Annex D of the Agreement or such as amended and in strict compliance with the Project needs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The five percent (5%) limit on contingency is provided only in Section 6.10 of the NEDA Guidelines:<br><blockquote>6.10.1 Payments in respect of costs which would exceed the estimates set forth in Section 6.1 may be chargeable to the contingency amounts in the respective estimates only if such costs are approved by the agency concerned prior to its being incurred and provided, further, that they shall be used only in line with the unit rates and costs specified in the contract and in strict compliance with the project needs. Contingency amount shall not exceed 5% of the amount of the contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>It is, thus, critical to determine whether this restriction in the NEDA Guidelines applies to the Consultancy Agreement.<br><br>Section 9.3 of the NEDA Guidelines states:<br><blockquote>The above notwithstanding, these IRR shall not negate any existing and future commitments with respect to the selection of Consultants financed partly or wholly with funds from international financial institutions, as well as from bilateral and other similar sources as stipulated in the corresponding agreements with such institutions/sources.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>The Consultancy Agreement in this case involves the hiring of consultants for the NAIA Terminal 2 Development Project. It is financed by the loan from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan under Loan Agreement No. PH-136. Thus, the NEDA Guidelines cannot negate any commitments under Loan Agreement No. PH-136 with respect to the selection of consultants.<br><br>Thus, I affirm that the Consultancy Agreement is a conjunct of, or has a joint and simultaneous occurrence with, Loan Agreement No. PH-136. It is not completely unrelated to or independent of the other. The whereas clauses of the Consultancy Agreement state:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, MIAA desires to implement the Terminal 2 Development Project of Ninoy Aquino International Airport, hereinafter referred to as the "Project":<br><br>WHEREAS, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan has extended a loan (OECF Loan Agreement No. PH-136) to MIAA for the purpose;<br><br>WHEREAS, [Aeroports de Paris] has successfully completed the engineering design of the Terminal 2 under the French loan assistance program;<br><br>WHEREAS, the implementation of the Project requires competent consulting services for additional study, assistance in bidding, construction management and post construction services;<br><br>WHEREAS, [Aeroports de Paris] and [Japan Airports Consultants, Inc.] are willing to work together as an ad hoc association named ADP-JAC CONSORTIUM, and jointly represent that they are qualified, desirous and willing to render such consulting services;<br><br>WHEREAS, both [Aeroports de Paris] and [Japan Airports Consultants, Inc.]declare that they shall be jointly and severally responsible for the services of the Project and that [Aeroports de Paris] shall act as a leader of Consultant; and further that, as such leader, shall be solely and fully responsible for any document which [Aeroports de Paris] previously made and submitted to MIAA prior to the formation of the consortium and which is related to the detailed architectural and engineering design contract for NAIA Terminal 2;<br><br>WHEREAS, MIAA has agreed to engage Consultant for the consulting services for the Project and <i>OECF has concurred with such intention of MIAA</i>;<br><br>WHEREAS, Consultant represents that it has made arrangements to associate itself, in undertaking the Services covered under this Agreement, with four (4) local firms acting as local sub-consultants[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Consultancy Agreement arose from the commitments under Loan Agreement No. PH-136 as to the selection of consultants. Included in these commitments is the procurement procedure under Loan Agreement No. PH-136, which states that the employment of consultants shall be in accordance with the 1987 Guidelines for the Employment of Consultants by OECF Borrowers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The procedure provides:<br><blockquote><center>Procurement Procedure<br></center><br>Section 1.
