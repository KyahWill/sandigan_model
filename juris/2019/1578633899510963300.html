These documents were declared inadmissible for being mere copies. Appellants argue the originals were in the custody of the DENR office in Tacurong, Sultan Kudarat, and that it should have sufficed that Alicia Flores, the custodian of the records, had identified the copies. The Court is not entirely convinced of appellants' contention. But the fact remains that appellants have been able to present OCT (P-45002) Pls-9154, in the name of Lucia Heretape; OCT (P-45003) P-9155, in the name of Nestor Heretape; and OCT (P-42941) P-349 in the name of Roberto Landero. This is enough. In view of appellee's failure to overcome the presumptions in favor of these certificates of title, their validity will be sustained.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED.

This standard of proof is derived from American common law. It is less than proof beyond reasonable doubt (for criminal cases) but greater than preponderance of evidence (for civil cases). The degree of believability is higher than that of an ordinary civil case. Civil cases only require a preponderance of evidence to meet the required burden of proof. x x x The imputation of fraud in a civil case requires the presentation of clear and convincing evidence. Mere allegations will not suffice to sustain the existence of fraud. The burden of evidence rests on the part of the plaintiff or the party alleging fraud.

As to the second requisite pertaining to ownership, the parties have conflicting claims.<br><br>On one hand, petitioners claim to be the real owners of Lot 1064. They presented in evidence tax receipts for years 1963 to 1967 and Tax Declaration No. 6085 dated 1963. These pieces of evidence, however, cannot prevail, let alone, defeat respondents' respective original certificates of title to the lots in question, <i>viz</i>: OCT (P-45002) Pls-9154 (Lot 2238-B) - Lucibar Heretape, OCT (P-45003) P-9155 (Lot 2238-A) - Nestor Heretape, and OCT (P-42941) P-349 (Lot 1064-A) - Roberto Landero.<br><br>For the Torrens title is conclusive evidence with respect to the ownership of the land described therein, and other matters which can be litigated and decided in land registration proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As such, the titleholder is entitled to all the attributes of ownership of the property, including possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Here, OCT (P-45002) Pls-9154, OCT (P-45003) P-9155, and OCT (P-42941) P-3449 are conclusive evidence that Lucibar Heretape, Nestor Heretape, and Roberto Landero, in whose names the lots are registered, are indeed the real owners thereof.<br><br>In contrast, petitioners' single tax declarations and old tax receipts dated 1963 - 1967 are not considered evidence of ownership, hence, the same cannot defeat respondents' certificates of title to the lots in question. More so because the certificates of title issued in the names of Lucibar Heretape, Nestor Heretape, and. Roberto Landero, came at a much later date than the tax declaration and tax receipts. <b><i>Cureg v. IAC</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> states: "<i>We hold that said tax declaration, being of an earlier date cannot defeat an original certificate of title which is of a later date</i>."<br><br>Petitioners also impute fraud on respondents Lucibar Heretape, Roberto Landero, Nestor Heretape, and Rosa Rogador, who allegedly acquired possession and ownership of the land after petitioner Kawasa Magalang and his family were forced to evacuate the lot back in the 70s and refused to return the lots to petitioner Kawasa Magalang despite demand. In support of their allegation of fraud, petitioners only offered self-serving testimonies without anything more. Surely, self-serving testimonies are not evidence, nay clear and convincing evidence.<br><br>Lastly, petitioners assert they had acquired ownership of the lot by reason of prescription. Petitioner Kawasa Magalang testified that he inherited the 10-hectare lot from his grandparents and forefathers, and he had planted coconut, banana, bamboo trees and palay thereon. His daughter Sabpia Magalang Wahalon testified that she and her five siblings had previously lived on their father's 10-hectare lot.<br><br>In support of their claim of prescription, petitioners also presented Abad Ulama and Sumagayan Datindeg. Abad Ulama said that he had seen petitioner Kawasa Magalang planting coconuts, bananas, and palay on the land. Kawasa's father had also lived there with his family. Meanwhile, Sumagayan Datindeg also said that petitioner Kawasa Magalang was a farmer, who planted coconuts, bananas, and bamboo on his own land. Some of the trees were already tall and were about five years old when he saw these.<br><br>None of these supposed testimonies has established that petitioners indeed acquired ownership of the lot by prescription. The testimonies, if at all, are mere general statements. They do not at all prove that petitioners and their predecessors-in-interest had been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the subject land for more than thirty years. As explained in <b><i>Republic v. Alconaba</i></b>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><blockquote><b>In any case, respondents' bare assertions of possession and occupation by their predecessors-in-interest since 1940 (as testified to by Carmencita) or since 1949 (as testified to by Mauricio and declared in respondents' application for registration) are hardly "the well-nigh incontrovertible" evidence required in cases of this nature. Proof of specific acts of ownership must be presented to substantiate their claim. They cannot just offer general statements which are mere conclusions of law than factual evidence of possession.</b> Even granting that the possession by the respondents' parents commenced in 1940, still they failed to prove that their predecessors-in-interest had been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the subject land under a bona fide claim of acquisition of ownership. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>So must it be.<br><br>All told, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing petitioners' complaint for recovery of possession and ownership and/or declaration of nullity of acquisition of property.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The assailed Decision dated December 30, 2010 and Resolution dated October 6, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
