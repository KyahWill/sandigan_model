Puti) with the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD), Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP).<p> In her complaint, Canete claimed that her husband was a victim in a criminal case for kidnapping for ransom with double murder filed against Atty. Puti's client. Canete averred that Atty. Puti had, in numerous occasions, appeared in court while he was intoxicated and made discourteous and inappropriate remarks against the public and private prosecutors as well as the judge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p> Canete claimed that Atty.

Puti prayed for the dismissal of the complaint against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He denied ever appearing intoxicated in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He also claimed that it was Atty. Tan who provoked him when the latter made threats against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> According to him, it was his duty to call out the judge for being biased and that he was only discharging his duties to his client by representing him with zeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p> <p> A mandatory conference was held and both parties were subsequently ordered to submit their position papers. </p><p align="center"> <i>Findings of the IBP</i> </p><p> The Investigating Commissioner of the CBD issued a Report and Recommendation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> finding Atty. Puti liable for misconduct for violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and recommending his suspension for two (2) years from the practice of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Investigating Commissioner found that Atty. Puti failed to conduct himself with courtesy, fairness, and candor toward his professional colleagues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Further, his act of imputing bias on the judge was without basis and uncalled for.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Furthermore, his act of appearing at hearings while intoxicated was in utter disrespect to the court. </p><p> In Resolution No. XXI-2014-785, the IBP Board of Governors adopted and approved the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner, with modification: </p><blockquote> <p> RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED,<strong> with modification</strong>, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex "A", and finding the recommendation to be fully supported by the evidence on record and applicable laws, and for violation of the Lawyer's Oath, Canon 8, Rule 10.01, 10.03, Canon 10 and Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, Atty. Artemio Puti is hereby <strong>SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the records,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Atty. Puti did not file a motion for reconsideration despite receipt of the IBP Resolution. </p><p align="center"> <b><i>Ruling of the Court</i></b> </p><p> The Court adopts the findings of the IBP, with modifications. </p><p> Canete filed the instant complaint against Atty. Puti for: 1) appearing in the hearings while drunk; 2) provoking and insulting the prosecutors; and 3) disrespecting the court. These grounds shall be discussed in <i>seriatim</i>. </p><p> On the allegation that Atty. Puti appeared intoxicated in court on numerous occasions, Canete claimed that these were witnessed by several court personnel, his co-counsels, and opposing counsels.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Atty. Puti denied such claim and argued that there is no evidence on record that he appeared in court while intoxicated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The Court agrees with Atty. Puti. It was not sufficiently proven that Atty. Puti ever appeared at a court hearing while he was intoxicated — despite Canete's claim that the same was witnessed by several persons. Thus, Atty. Puti cannot be held liable on this ground. </p><p> Regarding the second ground, the TSN of the hearings held at the trial court plainly show that Atty. Puti employed impertinent and discourteous language towards the opposing counsels. </p><p> To recall, Atty. Puti called Atty. Tan "bakla" in a condescending manner. To be sure, the term "bakla" (gay) itself is not derogatory. It is used to describe a male person who is attracted to the same sex. Thus, the term in itself is not a source of offense as it is merely descriptive. However, when "bakla" is used in a pejorative and deprecating manner, then it becomes derogatory. Such offensive language finds no place in the courtroom or in any other place for that matter. Atty. Puti ought to be aware that using the term "bakla" in a derogatory way is no longer acceptable — as it should have been in the first place. Verily, in <i>Sy v. Fineza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court ruled that the respondent judge's act of ruling that a witness should not be given any credence because he is a "bakla" was most unbecoming of a judge. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> As against the public prosecutors, Atty. Puti made the following statement: "Bakit 2 kayong prosecutor? Malaki siguro bayad sa inyo."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Such remark was clearly unprofessional, especially since Atty. Puti used to be a public prosecutor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> By nonchalantly accusing the prosecutors of having been bribed or otherwise acting for a valuable consideration, Atty. Puti overstepped the bounds of courtesy, fairness, and candor which he owes to the opposing counsels. </p><p> For his statements against the private and public prosecutors, Atty. Puti violated the following provisions under the Code of Professional Responsibility: </p><blockquote> <p> CANON 8 - A lawyer shall conduct himself with courtesy, fairness, and candor toward his professional colleagues, and shall avoid harassing tactics against opposing counsel. </p> <p> Rule 8.01 - A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive, or otherwise improper. </p> </blockquote> <p> As regards the final ground, the TSN of the May 22, 2013 hearing shows that Atty. Puti made several remarks against the judge. Specifically, Atty. Puti stated in open court that the judge was abusing his discretion and implied that the judge was partial and biased. Moreover, Atty. Puti threatened the judge that he would withdraw from the case and walk out if his request was not granted. Again, such statements were improper. </p><p> While a lawyer, as an officer of the court, has the right to criticize the acts of courts and judges, the same must be made respectfully and through legitimate channels. In this case, Atty. Puti violated the following provisions in the Code of Professional Responsibility: </p><blockquote> <p> CANON 11 -A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others. </p> <p>Rule 11.03 - A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the Courts. </p> <p>Rule 11.04 - A lawyer shall not attribute to a Judge motives not supported by the record or have no materiality to the case. </p> </blockquote> <p> As defense, Atty. Puti claimed that he was merely doing his duty to call out the judge for being biased. He maintained that he was only discharging his duties to his client by representing him with zeal. Such contention deserves scant consideration. </p><p> While zeal or enthusiasm in championing a client's cause is desirable, unprofessional conduct stemming from such zeal or enthusiasm is disfavored.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> On the penalty to be imposed, the Court disagrees with the IBP's recommendation that Atty. Puti be suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months. While Atty. Puti is found to have violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, suspension from the practice of law is not a commensurate penalty. The Court has consistently held that disbarment and suspension of an attorney are the most severe forms of disciplinary action, which should be imposed with great caution. They should be meted out only for duly proven serious administrative charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Thus, while Atty. Puti is guilty of using inappropriate language against the opposing counsels and the judge, such transgression is not of a grievous character as to merit his suspension since his misconduct is considered as simple rather than grave. </p><p> In <i>Saberon v. Lorong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court meted the penalty of fine of P2,000.00 for a lawyer's use of intemperate language for referring to a party's pleadings as "a series of blackmail suits." In <i>Bacatan v. Dadula</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court <u>fined</u> a lawyer for P2,000.00 for making unfounded accusations of partiality, bias, and corruption against the prosecutor. More recently, in <i>Quilendrino v. Icasiano</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> a lawyer was <u>reprimanded</u> for violating Canon 8, Rule 8.01, Canon 11, and Rule 11.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. </p><p> As applied to this case, the Court finds it best to temper the penalty for Atty. Puti's infraction. The Court also takes into consideration that this is the first administrative case against Atty. Puti in his more than three decades in the legal profession. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding Atty.
