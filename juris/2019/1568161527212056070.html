				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A homeowners' association may regulate passage into a subdivision for the safety and security of its residents, even if its roads have already been donated to the local government. It has the right to set goals for the promotion of safety and security, peace, comfort, and the general welfare of its residents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> assailing the Court of Appeals' July 5, 2013 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and February 12, 2014 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 115198. The Court of Appeals set aside the Office of the President's March 24, 2010 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and found the "No Sticker, No ID, No Entry" Policy valid and issued within the authority of the homeowners' association.<br><br>Diamond Subdivision is a residential subdivision in Balibago, Angeles City, Pampanga with several commercial establishments operating within it. These establishments include beer houses, karaoke bars, night clubs, and other drinking joints.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Because of these, patrons, customers, and many other people freely come in and out of Diamond Subdivision. Such unrestricted access to the subdivision, however, also exposed its residents to incidents of robbery, <i>akyat-bahay</i>, prostitution, rape, loud music, and noise that would last until the wee hours of the morning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Diamond Homeowners &amp; Resident Association (Diamond Homeowners), the legitimate homeowners' association of Diamond Subdivision, sought to address the residents' peace and security issues by raising their concerns to the City Council of Angeles City (Angeles City Council).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On February 24, 2003, the Angeles City Council issued Ordinance No. 132,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> series of 2003, reclassifying Diamond Subdivision as exclusively residential and prohibited the further establishment and operation of any business except for those already existing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The Ordinance states:<br><blockquote>Whereas, legitimate homeowners of the Diamond Subdivision have presented to the City Council their serious concern on what is presently occurring in their subdivision;<br><br>Whereas, with the present classification of Diamond Subdivision constant problems of peace and order have confronted the homeowners and residents affecting their lives, property and security;<br><br>Whereas, the introduction of business establishments in an uncontrolled manner have likewise proliferated due to the current classification of the subdivision;<br><br>Whereas, due to the R-2 classification of Diamond Subdivision the value of property have not increase[d], despite its strategic location;<br><br>Whereas, there is an urgent need to address all the concern[s] of the homeowners and residents of Diamond Subdivision;<br><br>Whereas, the appropriate and immediate solution to the present concerns is the reclassification of Diamond Subdivision from Residential 2 to Residential 1 Classification.<br><br>Now therefore foregoing considered, the City Council of Angeles City in session assembled hereby resolved to ordain:<br><br>Section 1. An Ordinance reclassifying Diamond Subdivision located in Balibago, Angeles City from Residential 2 to Residential 1 Classification status, be as it is hereby, approved.<br><br>Section 2. Arayat and S.L. Orosa Streets and the service road of Diamond Subdivision are exempted from this new classification.<br><br>Section 3. That existing and legitimate business establishments operating within the territorial boundaries of the said Diamond Subdivision as of approval of the ordinance shall remain and continue to operate and no commercial establishment of any kind shall be allowed thereafter.<br><br>Section 4. Unless by hereditary succession no business establishment rights shall be transferred to any individual or entity after approval of this ordinance.<br><br>Section 5. This Ordinance shall take effect upon its approval.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>However, this Ordinance was not complied with as more beer gardens and nightclubs were still put up. The peace, order, and security situation in the subdivision did not improve.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Among those affected was William G. Kwong (Kwong). A resident of Diamond Subdivision for more than 38 years, he runs three (3) motels<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in the subdivision under his company, William G. Kwong Management, Inc.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Seeking to address his security concerns, Kwong proposed to his neighbors that guard posts with telephone lines be set up at the entry and exit points on the street where he resides to screen all incoming and outgoing visitors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In an August 3, 2006 Letter, Kwong wrote:<br><blockquote>TO THE RESIDENTS OF EMMANUEL STREET <br>Diamond Subdivision, Balibago<br>Angeles City<br><br>Dear MR/MS _______,<br><br>In direct response to a sharp increase in criminal activities in our subdivision, a number of which have remained unreported, I would like to ask your approval and cooperation on a number of proposals, which I outlined below, for our own protection and safety:<br><blockquote>1. To put up security gates on both entry/exit points of Emmanuel Street.<br><br>2. To permanently seal off the proposed gate at Emmanuel Street corner V.Y. Orosa Street.<br><br>3. To engage the services of two security guards to man the gate 24 hours a day at Emmanuel Street comer Marlim Avenue.<br><br>4. To install a telephone line at the guard's booth to screen all incoming and outgoing visitors and outsiders. The guard will have to call the residents for approval before he lets anyone in.<br></blockquote>With regard to the costs of this project, I am willing to shoulder the cost of the two security gates and one-half (1/2) of the monthly security and telephone fees, which amounts to approximately Nine Thousand Pesos (PhP9,000.00). In support of this project, I would like to request the residents to shoulder the remaining one-half (1/2) of the monthly costs of security and telephone fees, which also amounts to approximately Nine Thousand Pesos (PhP9,000.0[0]) for 15 household or Six Hundred Pesos (PhP600.00) a month per household.<br><br>It is with the sense of cooperation and solidarity that I ask you to consider this project for the security and safety of our family.<br><br>Thank you for most (<i>sic</i>) kind attention and understanding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>However, the other residents of Diamond Subdivision also wanted their security concerns addressed. Thus, to safeguard the whole subdivision, Diamond Homeowners proposed the "No Sticker, No ID, No Entry" Policy (the Policy).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Under the Policy, visitors on vehicles who sought to enter the premises must leave with the subdivision guards their identification cards, which they may reclaim upon leaving the subdivision. Visitors on foot were not required to surrender theirs. Meanwhile, residents with vehicles may obtain stickers to identify themselves so that they did not need to surrender any identification card.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After consultations and meetings, the Policy was approved in December 2006. Diamond Homeowners later issued a Memorandum to inform residents that the Policy would be implemented by March 15, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Kwong, however, contested the Policy.<br><br>When Diamond Homeowners did not heed his objection, Kwong filed before the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board Regional Office a Complaint for the issuance of a cease and desist order with application for a temporary restraining order. He argued that the Policy was invalid because the subdivision roads have been donated to the City of Angeles in 1974 and were, thus, public roads that must be open for public use. Likewise, he contended that the screening of visitors would be cumbersome for his customers, affecting his businesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Ruling in Kwong's favor, the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board Regional Office issued a Cease and Desist Order and a Temporary Restraining Order. The records were later forwarded to the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board Arbiter for final disposition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In his August 10, 2007 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board Arbiter lifted the Cease and Desist Order and dismissed Kwong's Complaint. He ruled that the Policy's alleged damage to Kwong's business was "imaginary, unsubstantiated[,] and hypothetical[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Arbiter further held that the protection and security of Diamond Subdivision's residents were the primary and utmost concern, and must be prioritized over the convenience of motel patrons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> He ruled that the Policy's objective to protect the community at large was far greater than Kwong's business concerns.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Upholding the Policy's validity, the Arbiter found that it neither prohibited nor impaired the use of the roads. Neither did it change the classification of the roads nor usurp the government's authority. Moreover, the roads were still for public use, and the public was still allowed to pass as long as they presented identification cards. The Arbiter noted that there was no evidence showing that persons were being refused access or asked to pay for its use.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On appeal before the Board of Commissioners of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, the Arbiter's ruling was reversed. In its September 12, 2008 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Board of Commissioners found merit in Kwong's appeal and declared the Policy void for being "unjustifiable and without legal basis."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In subjecting the subdivision roads to the Policy, the Board of Commissioners found that they were turned into private roads-inaccessible, not open to the public, and under the control of Diamond Homeowners. It also ruled that Kwong and William G. Kwong Management, Inc. have already acquired a vested right to unrestricted passage through the subdivision roads since 1974 because they owned the subdivision lots and because the public use of the roads is guaranteed by law. It found that to limit or impose pecuniary conditions for their enjoyment over the roads violates the roads' public character.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The Board of Commissioners also ruled that the Policy must be justified by an issue so serious and overwhelming that it is prioritized over the lot owners' rights. Diamond Homeowners, it fmmd, failed to present evidence of peace and security issues within the subdivision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Office of the President, in its March 24, 2010 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> affirmed the Board of Commissioners' Decision <i>in toto</i>. It noted that the factual findings of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, as the administrative agency with the technical expertise on the matter, were entitled to great respect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Hence, Diamond Homeowners elevated the case to the Court of Appeals via a Petition for Review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In its July 5, 2013 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court of Appeals granted Diamond Homeowners' Petition and set aside the Office of the President's Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It found that Diamond Homeowners was authorized in enacting the Policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that while the local government acquires ownership rights, these rights should be harmonized with the interests of homeowners who invested life savings in exchange for special amenities, comfort, and tighter security, which non-subdivisions did not offer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the State recognized this interest in Presidential Decree No. 957, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1216, and recently in Republic Act No. 9904, or the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals noted that Presidential Decree No. 957, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1216, required the donation of subdivision roads to the local government. While the issuance was silent on regulating access to subdivision roads, it found that the requirement was imposed to benefit homeowners, amid subdivision developers who tended to fail in maintaining the upkeep of subdivision roads, alleys, and sidewalks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It cited <i>Albon. v. Fernando</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which explained that subdivision owners or developers were relieved of maintaining roads and open spaces once they have been donated to the local government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the Court of Appeals noted the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations, under which homeowners were given the: right to organize to protect and promote their mutual benefits and the power to create rules necessary to regulate and operate the subdivision facilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Section 10(d) provided homeowners' associations the right to regulate access to and passage through the subdivision roads to preserve privacy, tranquility, internal security, safety, and traffic order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals further noted that the law did not distinguish between roads donated to the local government and those retained by the subdivision owners or developers. This showed that while the local government had ownership of subdivision roads, homeowners' associations maintained their enjoyment, possession, and management.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the Court of Appeals held that the Policy was reasonably exercised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It ruled that Ordinance No. 132 was sufficient to show that Diamond Subdivision was encountering peace, order, and security problems, as it explicitly stated that the subdivision was confronted with such issues affecting the residents and homeowners. As a public document, it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of facts stated in it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The Court of Appeals further found that the City of Angeles would not have approved Ordinance No. 132 had it not been substantiated by these facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court of Appeals held the Policy reasonable because its purpose was to secure and ensure the peace, safety, and security of homeowners and residents. It found that not only was the Policy supported by 314 Diamond Homeowners members, but that only Kwong opposed it, and he himself recognized the security concerns when he had proposed to set up gates at the entry and exit points on the street where he resides.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals further found that even if Kwong's proprietary rights may be affected, it is still his duty as a Diamond Homeowners member to support and participate in the association's projects. Likewise, it held that his personal interests may be limited for the promotion of the association's goals for the community at large.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision of the Office of the President dated March 24, 2010 and its Order dated June 10, 2010 are hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, the complaint for the issuance of a cease and desist order plus damages with application for temporary restraining order filed before the House (<i>sic</i>) and Land Use Regulatory Board Region III is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals denied Kwong's Motion for Reconsideration in its February 12, 2014 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Hence, Kwong and William G. Kwong Management, Inc. filed this Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Diamond Homeowners filed a Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and, in turn, petitioners filed their Reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The parties later submitted their respective Memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Petitioners insist that the Policy is invalid.<br><br>They assert that the subdivision roads are public roads for public use, and outside the commerce of man, having been donated to the Angeles City government since 1974.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> They maintain that access to and use of Diamond Subdivision roads should be open to the general public, not limited to privileged individuals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> They point out that these roads cannot be alienated, leased, be the subject of contracts, be acquired by prescription, be subjected to attachment and execution, be burdened by any voluntary easement, or be under the control of private persons or entities, including homeowners' associations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further argue that the Policy is an unauthorized restriction on the use of public roads as it unduly converts them to private roads, hinders their accessibility from the public, and subjects them under the exclusive control of Diamond Homeowners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Petitioners insist that it is the City of Angeles that has the power to control and regulate the use of roads.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As such, they argue that Diamond Homeowners should have had the city government address its concerns.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Petitioners contend that the Local Government Code has conferred local government units with the authority to regulate the use of public roads and ensure protection and promotion of public welfare,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> well before the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations was enacted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioners claim that the local governments' power to regulate roads cannot be exercised by a private entity. To do so would be a usurpation of the local government's authority, and an illegal abdication of power on the part of the latter. Thus, they posit that, to their and the public's prejudice, the Policy disregards the primary right, power, and authority of the City of Angeles to regulate the use of the public roads.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further insist that nothing in Presidential Decree Nos. 957 and 1216 or in <i>Albon</i>, which the Court of Appeals relied on, gives homeowners' associations the authority to regulate the use of subdivision roads that have already been donated to the local government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also contend that since the Policy was issued before the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations, it should not apply retroactively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In any case, they assert that the law did not give homeowners' associations absolute and unbridled power to regulate the use of subdivision roads. They cite Section 10(d), which lists the requisites that limit a homeowners' association's rights and powers,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> showing that its power is merely delegated and conditional. A homeowners' association cannot arrogate unto itself the power to issue the Policy or limit or prevent the free use of public roads without complying with the law's requisites, as it would be <i>ultra vires</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Petitioners point out that because respondent failed to comply with the requisites under Section 10(d),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> it violated the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> They claim that the required public consultations must include the general public who use the public road, and should not be limited to the subdivision residents or the homeowners' association members. They argue that it should be done the same way public hearings are conducted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod before the enactment of an ordinance or resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further allege that no authority from or memorandum of agreement with the City of Angeles was obtained. They maintain that Ordinance No. 132 cannot be treated as the required memorandum of agreement because it made no mention of the Policy. They argue that a separate ordinance is necessary to comply with the requirements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further allege that while Ordinance No. 132 reclassified Diamond Subdivision as exclusively residential, it still expressly exempted Arayat and S.L. Orosa Streets and the service road from the classification. The ordinance, they point out, also recognized that the existing businesses have acquired a vested right to operate within the subdivision as it allowed them to continue their operations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also cite Sections 2 and 18 of the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations, which provide that homeowners' associations are encouraged to actively cooperate with the local government unit to pursue common goals and provide vital and basic services. They claim that to perform this mandate, the homeowners' association should not disregard the law that gives them the power to regulate roads.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Petitioners contend that if the provisions of the Local Government Code and the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations were to be harmonized, it is the local government unit that has the primary right and power to regulate the use of the public roads. Homeowners' associations only have limited, delegated power, which may only be exercised upon compliance with the conditions in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Moreover, petitioners deny that there are security concerns within the subdivision. They claim that the Policy was enacted based on a speculative, conjectural, and negative exaggeration of the actual situation, as there is no single evidence of an actual crime committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Likewise, they submit that Ordinance No. 132 cannot be considered as competent evidence of the alleged criminality in the subdivision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioners argue that the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board has the technical expertise and special competence on matters involving the business of developing subdivisions and condominiums. Thus, its factual findings should be respected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent insists that the Policy is valid.<br><br>In its Memorandum, respondent asserts it has the right and authority to issue the Policy under Section 10(d) of the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations. It insists that it issued the Policy to preserve "privacy, tranqui[l]ity, internal security[,] safety[,] and traffic order."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Respondent further cites Section 30 of Presidential Decree No. 957, which mandates subdivision associations to promote and protect the mutual interests of homeowners, and Section 5 of the Rules on Registration and Supervision of Homeowners Association, which empowers homeowners' associations to adopt rules and regulations, and to exercise other powers necessary to govern and operate the association. It argues that this right and authority applies even if the subdivision roads have been donated to the local government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Respondent points out that it issued the Policy to only regulate the use of roads and streets inside Diamond Subdivision. It neither recategorized them as private property nor exercised acts of private ownership over them. It emphasizes that the roads are still public roads, open for public use.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Respondent claims that subdivision owners were required to donate their roads to the local government primarily to protect and benefit the residents themselves, as some developers would lose interest in maintaining the subdivision's upkeep.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> They claim that no law puts the exclusive authority to control, dispose, and enjoy the roads to local government units, to the exclusion of the homeowners, especially since the donation was intended for the latter's benefit. Moreover, no law denies associations their right to regulate open spaces and roads within their subdivisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that while the local government units own the lots, their enjoyment, possession, and management are retained by the homeowners and their association.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Respondent further asserts that there was a valid reason for the Policy's adoption.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It was not a whimsical exercise of authority to exclude the public from using the roads, but an effort to attain peace and order within the subdivision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Respondent emphasizes that the Policy was applied because the public's uncontrolled and unrestricted passage into the subdivision has made crimes rampant within it. It asserts that the situation has caused its residents fear, discomfort, and disquiet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that while the Angeles City Council recognized issues of peace and order in Ordinance No. 132,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> its intervention was not sufficient to abate the recurring crimes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Respondent narrates that after the residents of the subdivision clamored for action, it studied and sought advice from other subdivisions in Angeles City that implemented the same Policy, as they had minimal security problems within their subdivision. Respondent alleges that when the Policy was approved by 314 legitimate residents<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and implemented, the crimes decreased as it was able to deter lawless elements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Thus, the Policy has improved the peace and order of the subdivision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Respondent points out that only petitioner Kwong questioned the policy, even if he recognized the crime and disorder issue himself. It points out that prior to the Policy, he was willing to shoulder the cost of putting up security gates on both the entry and exit points of the street where he resides to prohibit by-passers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> He even sought to block those who do not live on his street, whether or not the person was a Diamond Subdivision resident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> It is, therefore, contradictory for him to oppose the more reasonable solution of implementing the Policy in the entire subdivision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Respondent further argues that under the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners' Associations, subdivision residents are duty bound to support and participate in the association's projects and activities, especially if the project is supported by 314 members, with petitioner Kwong as the only opposition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Respondent further maintains that every person's right to life, property, and security is constitutionally protected.

But the argument does not find justification with applicable jurisprudence. When the lot in question had been allotted as an open space by Carmel Corporation, <i>it had become the property of the Quezon City government and/or the Republic of the Philippines held under the management, control and enjoyment of the residents and homeowners of Carmel II-A Subdivision</i>. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Therefore, with the approval of the subdivision plan of Carmel II­ A followed with it the exclusion of the land from the commerce of man. It would not be too presumptuous to conclude that the sale by Carmel Corporation which resulted in the subsequent private dealings involving this public property is void <i>ab initio</i>. And the mere fact that Carmel Corporation did not consider Lot II, Block 6 as the designated open space would not give it licentious freedom to sell such public property "under the nose"! so to speak, <i>of the Quezon City government, the Republic of the Philippines, and the homeowners who are the direct beneficiaries thereof</i>. While the afore-enumerated entities do not hold the owners' duplicate title over the open space, hence, could not properly forewarned of any prejudicial act of conveyance or encumbrance perpetrated by the subdivision owner/developer, they should not be faulted for taking a belated attempt to question these conveyances affecting the open space which are made manifest only during the actual disruptions accompanying the exercise of ownership and possession by the ultimate vendee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>From all these, we hold that the Policy is valid.

It neither prohibits nor impairs the use of the roads. It does not prevent the public from using the roads, as all are entitled to enter, exit, and pass through them. One must only surrender an identification card to ensure the security of the residents. As stated, the residents and homeowners, including petitioner Kwong, have valid security concerns amid a sharp increase in criminal activities within the subdivision.<br><br>The Policy, likewise, neither denies nor impairs any of the local government's rights of ownership. Respondent does not assert that it owns the subdivision roads or claims any private right over them. Even with the Policy, the State still has the <i>jus possidendi</i> (right to possess), <i>jus utendi</i> (right to use), <i>just fruendi</i> (right to its fruits), <i>jus abutendi</i> (right to consume), and <i>jus disponendi</i> (right to dispose) of the subdivision roads. It still has the power to temporarily close, permanently open, or generally regulate the subdivision roads.<br><br>It must be pointed out that this case is not even between a homeowners' association and the local government, but a homeowners' association and a resident who disagrees with the Policy. Respondent, therefore, is not asserting any right against any local government act on the subdivision roads. Neither is the local government claiming that its right to regulate the roads is being impinged upon.<br><br>Furthe1more, Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 957, as amended, on the donation of subdivision roads to the local government, "was [enacted] to remedy the situation prevalent at that time where owners/developers fail to keep up with their obligation of providing and maintaining the subdivision roads, alleys[,] and sidewalks."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> The whereas clauses of Presidential Decree No. 957 reveal the legislative intent:<br><blockquote><i>WHEREAS, it is the policy of the State to afford its inhabitants the requirements of decent human settlement and to provide them with ample opportunities for improving their quality of life;<br><br>WHEREAS, numerous reports reveal that many real estate subdivision owners, developers, operators, and/or sellers have reneged on their representations and obligations to provide and maintain properly subdivision roads, drainage, sewerage, water systems, lighting systems, and other similar basic requirements, thus endangering the health and safety of home and lot buyers;</i><br><br>WHEREAS, reports of alarming magnitude also show cases of swindling and fraudulent manipulations perpetrated by unscrupulous subdivision and condominium sellers and operators, such as failure to deliver titles to the buyers or titles free from liens and encumbrances, and to pay real estate taxes, and fraudulent sales of the same subdivision lots to different innocent purchasers for value;<br><br>WHEREAS, these acts not only undermine the land and housing program of the government but also defeat the objectives of the New Society, particularly the promotion of peace and order and the enhancement of the economic, social and moral condition of the Filipino people;<br><br>WHEREAS, this state of affairs has rendered it imperative that the real estate subdivision and condominium businesses be closely supervised and regulated, and that penalties be imposed on fraudulent practices and manipulations committed in connection therewith. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Evidently, here, the donation was for the benefit of the subdivision's homeowners, lot buyers, and residents. This must be taken into consideration in interpreting the provision for the donation:<br><blockquote>In the construction or interpretation of a legislative measure a presidential decree in these cases - the primary rule is to search for and determine the intent and spirit of the law. <i>Legislative intent is the controlling factor</i>, for in the words of this Court in <i>Hidalgo v. Hidalgo</i>, per Mr. Justice Claudio Teehankee, whatever is within the spirit of a statute is within the statute, and this has to be so if strict adherence to the letter would result in absurdity, injustice and contradictions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Spouses Belo v. Philippine National Bank</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><blockquote>It is well settled that courts are not to give a statute a meaning that would lead to absurdities. If the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one meaning, the absurdity of the result of one construction is a strong argument against its adoption, and in favor of such sensible interpretation. We test a law by its result. A law should not be interpreted so as not to cause an injustice. There are laws which are generally valid but may seem arbitrary when applied in a particular case because of its peculiar circumstances. We are not bound to apply them in slavish obedience to their language.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, the donation of the roads to the local government should not be interpreted in a way contrary to the legislative intent of benefiting the residents. Conversely, residents should not be disempowered from taking measures for the proper maintenance of their residential area. Under Section 30 of Presidential Decree No. 957, they may protect their mutual interests. Here, the Policy was not inconsistent with this purpose. To rule against it would be contrary to the intention of the law to protect their rights.<br><br>This Court further notes that the Deed of Donation recognizes the Diamond Subdivision's power to monitor the security within the subdivision. The Deed of Donation between the developer of Diamond Subdivision and the City of Angeles states:<br><blockquote>That it is a condition of this donation, that the Severina Realty Corporation will have the exclusive right to appoint and to enter into a contract with any duly licensed security guard agency for the security guard services of the Diamond Subdivision, Angeles City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the subdivision is still empowered to determine how best to maintain the security and safety within the subdivision.<br><br>Moreover, it is common knowledge that when homeowners purchase their properties from subdivisions, they pay a more valuable consideration in exchange for better facilities, safer security, and a higher degree of peace, order, and privacy. Some may also have purchased their properties in contemplation of their right to organize and to take measures to protect these interests. It would be an injustice if these were not taken into consideration in determining the validity of the Policy.<br><br>Here, the Policy was enacted to ensure the safety and security of Diamond Subdivision residents who have found themselves exposed to heightened crimes and lawlessness. The Policy was approved by 314 members of the homeowners' association, with only petitioner Kwong protesting the solution. His protest is ultimately rooted in the damage that the Policy has allegedly caused to his businesses. However, he failed to present any evidence of this damage.<br><br>It is established that he who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it. In <i>Republic v. Estate of Hans Menzi</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><blockquote>It is procedurally required for each party in a case to prove his own affirmative allegations by the degree of evidence required by law. In civil cases such as this one, the degree of evidence required of a party in order to support his claim is preponderance of evidence, or that evidence adduced by one party which is more conclusive and credible than that of the other party. It is therefore incumbent upon the plaintiff who is claiming a right to prove his case. Corollarily, the defendant must likewise prove its own allegations to buttress its claim that it is not liable.<br><br>The party who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it. The burden of proof may be on the plaintiff or the defendant. It is on the defendant if he alleges an affirmative defense which is not a denial of an essential ingredient in the plaintiff's cause of action, but is one which, if established, will be a good defense - <i>i.e.</i>, an "avoidance" of the claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Since petitioner Kwong presented no evidence of the damage caused to him, this Court cannot rule in his favor.<br><br>In any case, the community's welfare should prevail over the convenience of subdivision visitors who seek to patronize petitioners' businesses. Article XII, Section 6 of the Constitution provides that the use of property bears a social function, and economic enterprises of persons are still subject to the promotion of distributive justice and state intervention for the common good:<br><blockquote>SECTION 6. The use of property bears a social function, and all economic agents shall contribute to the common good. Individuals and private groups, including corporations, cooperatives, and similar collective organizations, shall have the right to own, establish, and operate economic enterprises, subject to the duty of the State to promote distributive justice and to intervene when the common good so demands.<br></blockquote>Article XIII, Section 1 of the Constitution states that the State may regulate the use of property and its increments for the common good:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. The Congress shall give highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect and enhance the right of all the people to human dignity, reduce social, economic, and political inequalities, and remove cultural inequities by equitably diffusing wealth and political power for the common good.<br><br>To this end, the State shall regulate the acquisition, ownership, use, and disposition of property and its increments.<br></blockquote>These provisions reveal that the property ownership and the rights that come with it are not without restrictions, but rather come with the consideration and mindfulness for the welfare of others in society. The Constitution still emphasizes and prioritizes the people's needs as a whole. Such is the case here: even if petitioner Kwong's rights are subordinated to the rights of the many, the Policy improves his own wellbeing and quality of life. In <i>Bel Air Village Association, Inc.</i>:<br><blockquote>Even assuming that defendant's ownership and enjoyment of the lot covered by TCT No. 81136 is limited because of the burden of being a member of plaintiff association <i>the goals and objectives of the association are far greater because they apply to and affect the community at large</i>. <i>It can be justified on legal grounds that a person's enjoyment of ownership may be restricted and limited if to do so the welfare of the community of which he is a member is promoted and attained. These benefits in which the defendant participates more than offset the burden and inconvenience that he may suffer.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the Court of Appeals' July 5, 2013 Decision and February 12, 2014 Resolution in CA-G.R.
