SP No. 113807 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA). </p><p> The assailed Decision and Resolution affirm the lower courts' uniform rulings which ordered petitioners Dr. Romy Modomo and Jocelyn Modomo (collectively, Spouses Modomo) to immediately surrender possession of a certain parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 208683 registered in the name of respondents Moises P.

Layug (collectively, Spouses Layug).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p align="center"> <i>The Facts</i> </p><p>The facts, as narrated by the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati City, Branch 64, and subsequently adopted by the CA, are as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> [Spouses Layug filed] a complaint for [e]jectment x x x before the [MeTC], Branch 65 of Makati on July 23, 2008 which was raffled off to [Branch 64] after a failed Mediation and Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) x x x.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> [Spouses Layug] alleged among others that[:] they are the registered owner[s] and legal possessors of a parcel of land located at No. 1038 A.P. Reyes Street corner Cristobal Street, Barangay Tejeros, Makati City covered by [Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT)] No. 208683. Aforesaid property was leased to [Spouses Modomo] for a period of seven (7) years. Pursuant to the [Contract of Lease<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated February 11, 2005 (Contract of Lease), Spouses Modomo agreed to] pay the amount of <strong>Php170,000.00</strong> as monthly rentals subject to an escalation of 10% for the second and third year, 15% on the fourth and fifth year and 20% on the sixth and seventh year. <strong>It was also agreed by the parties that real estate taxes on the property shall be paid by [Spouses Modomo].</strong> In view of [these] stipulation[s], an Addendum to the Contract was executed by the parties [also] on February 11, 2005 regarding the terms and conditions of payment of rentals. <strong>Subsequently, [Spouses Modomo] defaulted in the payment of the escalation of [rental fees] commencing from the year 2006 up to [the filing of the complaint for ejectment on Jury 23, 2008].</strong> [Spouses Modomo] also failed to pay their rentals for the year 2008 which would have been paid in advance. [Spouses Layug] also alleged, that [Spouses Modomo] failed to pay the real estate taxes due on the property x x x which [Spouses Layug] paid in [Spouses Modomo's] behalf. [Spouses Layug sent a] letter x x x to [Spouses Modomo] [demanding that they] settle their unpaid monthly rentals x x x but to no avail. <strong>Ultimately, [a] letter dated March 24, 2008 was sent to [Spouses Modomo] terminating the [C]ontract [of Lease] and containing therein a demand for [Spouses Modomo] to vacate the premises.</strong> To thresh out the matter, the case was referred to the Barangay of Tejeros for conciliation but to no avail. Hence, a certification to file action was issued. <b>To protect [their] interest, [Spouses Layug] instituted the present suit claiming that [Spouses Modomo] should vacate the premises, x x x pay [Spouses Layug] rental arrearages, attorney's fees and costs of suit.</b> </p> <p> On the contrary[, Spouses Modomo] argued that[: the] parties originally agreed that [Spouses Modomo w]ould pay the amount of Php170,000.00 subject to an escalation of 10% for the second and third year, 15% on the fourth and fifth year and 20% on the sixth and seventh year. However, considering that [Jocelyn] Modomo [had] introduce [d] improvements thereon[,] she [asked] [Spouses Layug] to change certain provisions in the Contract of Lease. <b>Based on their conversation[,] [Spouses Layug] agreed to reduce the monthly rentals to Php150,000.00 and the non-imposition of the escalation clause and the real estate tax provision.</b> [Spouses Modomo] religiously paid the rentals strictly in accordance with their subsequent agreements. <b>[Spouses Layug], on the second year of the [C]ontract [of Lease], imposed the 10% escalation x x x. [Spouses Modomo] however, reminded [Spouses Layug] of their previous agreement regarding the non-imposition of the escalation clause and the real estate tax provision. </b>Thereafter, [Spouses Modomo] alleged that [Spouses Layug agreed not to] impose the escalation clause [in] the [C]ontract of [L]ease in view of the introduction of the improvements in the premises amounting to approximately Two Million pesos [Php2,000,000.00]. Again [i]n 2008[, Spouses Layug] [purportedly] reneged on their agreements by imposing the escalation clause. Therefore, [Spouses Modomo] pray[ed] that the case be dismissed because the [C]ontract of [L]ease dated February 11, 2005 ha[d] been amended by the subsequent oral agreements between the parties. [Spouses Modomo further claimed that Spouses Layug] are in estoppel <i>in pais</i>, [due to] their unconditional acceptance of the reduced x x x monthly [rental] x x x of Php150,000.00 instead of Php170,000.00. [Spouses Modomo] also alleged that the [C]ontract of [L]ease has been novated in view of the subsequent oral agreements of the parties. Hence, [Spouses Modomo] pray[ed] for the dismissal of the case and [that] they be [declared] entitled to their counterclaim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>MeTC Ruling</i></p><p> On July 20, 2009, the MeTC issued a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> in favor of Spouses Layug, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the [MeTC] renders judgment ordering [Spouses Modomo] to immediately surrender the peaceful possession of the leased property with improvements thereon located at No. 1038 A.P.

Hence, Spouses Modomo's real property covered by TCT No. T-130972 was made subject of a Notice of Sheriffs Sale on Execution of Real Property<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> scheduled on March 5 and 9 of the following year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This prompted Spouses Modomo to file an Urgent Motion for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order/Status Quo Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Urgent Motion) on February 21, 2012. </p><p> The Urgent Motion was opposed by Spouses Layug through their Comment (To Petitioners' Urgent Motion)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> filed on June 25, 2012.

Moreover, the Court believes that the deferment of the auction sale will not prejudice nor cause irreparable damage against [Spouses Layug] considering that should the High Court rule on the pending issues therein, [the RTC] can promptly act accordingly. </p> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, [Spouses Modomo's] Urgent Motion to Defer Sale on Execution is hereby GRANTED.

Obligations may be modified by: </p> <p> <b>(1) Changing their object or principal conditions;</b> </p> <p>(2) Substituting the person of the debtor;</p> <p> (3) Subrogating a third person in the rights of the creditor. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Noted civilist Justice Eduardo P. Caguioa elucidated on the concept of modificatory novation as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x Novation has been defined as the substitution or alteration of an obligation by a subsequent one that cancels or modifies the preceding one. Unlike other modes of extinction of obligations, novation is a juridical act of dual function, in that at the time it extinguishes an obligation, it creates a new one in lieu of the old. x x x <b>This is not to say however, that in every case of novation the old obligation is necessarily extinguished. Our Civil Code now admits of the so-called imperfect or modificatory novation where the original obligation is not extinguished but modified or changed in some of the principal conditions of the obligation. Thus, article 1291 provides that obligations may be modified.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> While the Civil Code permits the subsequent modification of existing obligations, these obligations cannot be deemed modified in the absence of clear evidence to this effect. Novation is never presumed, and the <em>animus novandi</em>, whether total or partial, must appear by express agreement of the parties, or by their acts that are too clear and unequivocal to be mistaken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> Accordingly, the burden to show the existence of novation lies on the party alleging the same. </p><p> Applying the foregoing principles, the Court finds that while there has been a modificatory novation of the Contract of Lease through the parties' subsequent verbal agreement, such novation relates solely to the lowering of the monthly rental fee from Php170,000.00 to Php150,000.00. </p><p> The provisions governing escalation and real estate tax payment, as set forth under the Contract of Lease and modified by the subsequent written Addenda, stand. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The modification of the monthly rental fee through the parties' subsequent verbal agreement is confirmed by the evidence on record, and Spouses Layug's own submissions.</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The records are replete with evidence confirming the modification of the monthly rental fee through the subsequent verbal agreement of the parties. </p><p> Foremost, the Spouses Layug served upon Spouses Modomo several Statements of Account<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> reflecting the latter's unpaid balance. These statements show that Spouses Layug consistently computed Spouses Modomo's unpaid balance on the basis of the lowered monthly rental fee of Php150,000.00, instead of Php170,000.00. </p><p> In addition, Spouses Layug's Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated March 24, 2008 (Final Demand) also reflects a computation of Spouses Modomo's unpaid balance on the basis of the lowered monthly rental fee.</p><p> Finally, any doubt as to the modification of the monthly rental fee is dispelled by the statements in Spouses Layug's Comment to the Petition which unequivocally confirm such modification: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x The alleged novation on the monthly rental rate of [Php]150,000.00 from [Php]170,000.00 would not in anyway novate an existing and valid contract whereby all its valid and enforceable stipulations would be put to naught.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> <b>In fine, it may be true that the rental rate of [Php]170,000.00 was modified by the parties and a novation of the principal condition of the [C]ontract of [L]ease was thereby effected, nevertheless, such a modification did not render the [C]ontract of [L]ease as totally extinguished but rather[,] merely modified.</b> In fine, all other conditions of the contract[,] including the escalation clause on the monthly rental rate and the proportional payment of real property taxes and assessments by [Spouses Modomo] remain valid and subsisting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> These statements, coupled with the computation in the Statements of Account and Final Demand, confirm the parties' subsequent verbal agreement to lower the monthly rental fee from Php170,000.00 to Php150,000.00. Notably, even the MeTC, RTC and CA appear to have computed Spouses Layug's award for rental arrearages based on the lowered rental fee,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> despite the absence of an explicit recognition of the rental fee's modification in their respective judgments. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Spouses Modomo failed to establish that the provisions governing escalation and proportional payment of real estate tax payment have been similarly modified</i>.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>While the records bear sufficient evidence to show the subsequent modification of the monthly rental fee, no similar evidence exists on record to warrant the non-imposition of the provisions on annual escalation and proportional payment of real estate tax. </p><p> To note, the parties took pains to execute two <i>written</i> Addenda for the purpose of modifying the terms and conditions of the parties' Contract of Lease.</p><p> The first Addendum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated February 11, 2005 sets forth a detailed schedule of payment of rentals for the entire seven (7)-year term of the lease. </p><p> The second Addendum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated February 15, 2005 reflects the following modifications in relation to taxes and assessments, among others: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREAS, the<b> LESSORS</b> and <strong>LESSEE</strong> thereat mutually further agree to incorporate the following corrections to and additional stipulations to form part of the Contract of Lease, to wit: </p> <p>x x x x</p> <p align="center"><strong> TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS</strong> </p> <p> For the entire duration of this contract, including any extension and renewal thereof, the parties agreed that the LESSEE shall pay all taxes and assessments due the government for the portion of the above-mentioned parcels of land occupied by the building constructed thereon by the <b>LESSEE</b> which is the subject of this lease. <u>The parties agree to share whatever assessment of taxes for every year during the term of this Contract on the following sharing basis, to wit</u>: </p> <blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="26%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="37%"><div align="center"><u>Lessors</u></div></td> <td width="37%"><div align="center"><u>Lessee</u></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Lot</td> <td><div align="center">40%</div></td> <td><div align="center">60% </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Building</td> <td><div align="center">25% </div></td> <td><div align="center">75%<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>To be sure, neither the first nor second Addendum has the effect of: (i) waiving the imposition of escalation; or (ii) completely absolving Spouses Modomo from real estate tax liability. <strong>On the contrary, these Addenda reinforce the parties' intention to: (i) impose annual escalation at the rates set forth under the Contract of Lease; and (ii) impose proportional payment of real estate tax during the subsistence of the lease. </strong></p> <p> If the parties truly intended to further modify the Contract of Lease by deleting the provisions on escalation and proportional payment of real estate tax, they would have done so through<em> another</em> written document, as they have consistently done with all modifications relating to such matters.<strong> It must be stressed that unlike the modification of the monthly rental fee which is supported by several pieces of documentary evidence and confirmed by Spouses Layug's own submissions, the modification of the provisions on annual escalation and proportional payment of real estate tax is supported solely by Spouses Modomo's own self-serving statements. </strong> </p><p> <i>Estoppel does not apply</i>. </p><p> Spouses Modomo also insist that Spouses Layug should be precluded from denying the partial novation of the Contract of Lease since they accepted Spouses Modomo's monthly rental payments without escalation and proportional share in the real estate tax for three (3) years, starting on the second year of the lease term. As basis, Spouses Modomo harp on the principle of estoppel<i> in pais</i>. </p><p> Estoppel<em> in pais</em> arises when one, by his acts, representations or admissions, or by his own silence when he ought to speak out, intentionally or through culpable negligence, induces another to believe certain facts to exist and such other rightfully relies and acts on such belief, so that he will be prejudiced if the former is permitted to deny the existence of such facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> For the principle of estoppel <i>in pais </i>to apply, there must be: (i) conduct amounting to false representation or concealment of material facts or at least calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (ii) intent, or at least expectation that this conduct shall be acted upon, or at least influenced by the other party; and (iii) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the actual facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> Based on the records, Spouses Layug served upon Spouses Modomo several letters dated December 7, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> February 6, 2007<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and January 9, 2008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> expressing their objection to the latter's deficient payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> These letters belie Spouses Modomo's imputation of silence and acquiescence on the part of Spouses Layug. It can hardly be said that Spouses Layug falsely conveyed their acquiescence to Spouses Modomo's deficient payments through silence, there being no "silence" to speak of. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Spouses Modomo are not entitled to reimbursement for the cost of improvements made on the leased property</i>. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Finally, Spouses Modomo maintain that they are entitled to reimbursement under Article 1678 of the Civil Code, which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> ART. 1678. If the lessee makes, in good faith, useful improvements which are suitable to the use for which the lease is intended, without altering the form or substance of the property leased, the lessor upon the termination of the lease shall pay the lessee one-half of the value of the improvements at that time.
