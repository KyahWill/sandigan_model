They finished around 2 o'clock in the morning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On their way home, four (4) persons on board a motorcycle approached them. These men were later identified as Romeo Padal, Jr., Reynan Padal, and two (2) John Does. Together with three (3) of these men, Ragnel, Albert, Ron, and Ezzer proceeded to a vacant lot.

The fatal stab wound fractured Ragnel's 4<sup>th</sup> rib and pierced his pulmonary vein, causing his lung to collapse.

There was also no proof showing they harbored ill motive in testifying against appellants, thus, their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Their credible and positive identification of appellants, even standing alone, is already sufficient to convict appellants of the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As against the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses, appellants merely offered the defense of alibi. Romeo Padal insists that around 4 o'clock in the morning of December 31, 2007, he went to the market to buy sticky rice for his <i>sapin-sapin</i> and then spent the rest of the day cooking at home. Reynan Padal, on the other hand, claims that on December 30, 2007, he was waiting for passengers from 6 o'clock in the evening until 6 o'clock in the morning of December 31, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>We reiterate the rule that the witnesses' positive identification of the accused necessarily prevails over the defense of alibi.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>For one, alibi is inherently weak and easy to concoct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Alibi, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law as in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> For another, appellants failed to prove that it was impossible for them to have been at the <i>situs criminis</i> at the time the crime was committed. Surely, it was not physically improbable for Reynan to simply cross Acacia street at the time he was calling in passengers to board his motorcycle. In the case of Romeo who claims he was at home, all he needed to do was walk to the nearby street of Acacia where the victim got slain. Acacia street was only two (2) minutes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> away and could be easily negotiated by foot.<br><br>Finally, in <b><i>People v. Alemania,</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court also rejected the accused's alibi because no other witnesses came forward to corroborate his alibis, as in this case.<br><br><b><i>Appellants conspired<br>in killing the victim</i></b><br><br>Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code states that "conspiracy exists when two (2) or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <br><br>Here, appellants have shown that they acted in concert to achieve one common purpose: to assault the victim, thus: 1) Appellants and their two [2] companions arrived at the scene together on board a motorcycle; 2) While Romeo kicked and stabbed the victim, Reynan and the others blocked the friends of the victim from approaching and aiding him; and 3) After Romeo had stabbed the victim, he and his companions all fled together. Indubitably, their individual and collective actions â€“ before, during, and after the commission of the crime â€“ indicated a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments to finish off the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Each one, therefore, is equally liable for the victim's slaying.<br><br><b><i>Treachery cannot be appreciated</i></b><br><br>Although treachery is not alleged in the Information nor appreciated by both the trial court and Court of Appeals, the OSG, nonetheless, submits that it attended Ragnel's killing for he was not able to defend himself when appellant Romeo grabbed his hair (causing him to fall on the ground) after which, appellant Romeo kicked and stabbed him to death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> While he was doing these horrendous acts, Reynan and the others prevented the victim's friends from approaching or aiding the victim.<br><br>Section 9, Rule 110 of the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure provides, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9. Cause of the accusations. - The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment.<br><br>Here, the Information avers:<br><br>xxx the above-mentioned Romeo Welbar Padal, Jr., conspiring, and confederating with his co-accused Reynan Padal and two (2) John Does whose identities are yet to be known, armed with a knife and a gun, by means of a motor vehicle and with intent to kill, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attacked, assaulted, stabbed with the said knife one Ragnel Salcedo Laguardia, thereby inflicting upon the latter fatal injury which caused his death.<br><br>The crime was committed by means of a motor vehicle is hereby alleged as a qualifying circumstance.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote><br><br>As worded, the Information does not bear any allegations pertaining to treachery, nor the acts constituting the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Verily, for the Court now to appreciate treachery in the victim's killing is violative of appellants' right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them. <b><i>People v. Manalili</i></b> is in point, thus:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x an accused cannot be convicted of an offense, unless it is clearly charged in the complaint or information. <b>Constitutionally, he has a right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. To convict him of an offense other than that charged in the complaint or information would be violative of this constitutional right.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>So must it be.</blockquote><br><br><b><i>The use of motor vehicle qualified <br>the killing to murder</i></b><br><br>In any event, We conform with the findings of the trial court and Court of Appeals that "use of motor vehicle" qualified the victim's killing to murder. Records show that appellants on board a motorcycle chased the victim while the latter was running away for his life. For sure, appellants' use of a fast means of transportation, they easily gained advantage, outsped, and in no time caught up with the victim who was running for his life. Appellants later left the scene of the crime together on board the same motor vehicle. Clearly, therefore, the motorcycle was used as a means to facilitate the commission of the crime and to enable appellants' escape after they accomplished their mission to kill the victim. In <b><i>People v. Ong and Quintos</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court held that the use of motor vehicle aided in the commission of murder by enabling the accused to easily caught up with victim, directing the latter to the crime scene, and utilizing it to abscond, as in this case.<br><br><b><i>Penalty and Damages</i></b><br><br>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, murder is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. In the absence of any aggravating circumstance, the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on appellants.<br><br>As for the monetary awards, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of P38,500.00 as actual damages and civil indemnity of P50,000.00 sans moral damages, exemplary damages, and interest.<br><br>In conformity with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> these awards should be modified as follows:<br><br>The civil indemnity as compensation for the death of the victim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> should be increased from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00.<br><br>Moral damages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of P75,000.00 should be granted for the mental suffering, emotional anguish, and pain experienced by the victim's heirs; and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> to serve as a deterrent to the commission of the same crime.<br><br>For actual damages, Ragnel's heirs incurred P65,000.00 death expenses but only proved actual losses in the amount of P38,500.00. <b><i>People v.
