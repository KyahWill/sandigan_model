SP No. 131582 denying the petition for review filed by petitioner Augustin International Center, Inc.

Bartolome (Bartolome) and Rumby L. Yamat (Yamat; collectively, respondents) were illegally dismissed from employment. <p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b> </p><p>In 2010, Bartolome and Yamat applied as carpenter and tile setter, respectively, with AICI, an employment agency providing manpower to foreign corporations. They were eventually engaged by Golden Arrow Company, Ltd. (Golden Arrow), which had its office in Khartoum, Republic of Sudan. Thereafter, they signed their respective employment contracts stating that they would render services for a period not less than twenty-four (24) months.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In their contracts, there was a provision on dispute settlement that reads: </p><blockquote> <p> 14. Settlement of disputes: All claims and complaints relative to the employment contract of the employee shall be settled in accordance with Company policies, rules[,] and regulations. In case the Employee contests the decision of the employer, the matter shall be settled amicably <b><u>with [the] participation</u> of the Labour Attaché or any authorised representative of the Philippines Embassy nearest the site of employment</b>. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Upon their arrival in Sudan sometime in March and April 2011, Golden Arrow transferred their employment to its sister company, Al Mamoun Trading and Investment Company (Al Mamoun). A year later, or on May 2, 2012, Al Mamoun served Notices of Termination of Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to respondents, causing them to return to the Philippines. On May 22, 2012, they filed their complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> before the NLRC seeking that AICI and A1 Mamoun be held liable for illegal dismissal, breach of contract, and payment of the unexpired portion of the contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> For their part, AICI and Al Mamoun claimed that respondents abandoned their duties by mid-2012, based on the e-mail message<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> from Golden Arrow to that effect, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> 2.

Citing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the CA added that the phrase "all disputes" is not sufficient to divest the LA of its jurisdiction over termination disputes. In the same manner, the phrase "all claims and complaints" in respondents' employment contracts does not remove the LA's jurisdiction to decide whether respondents were legally terminated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> Hence, AICI filed this petition. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issues Before the Court</b> </p><p> The issues before the Court are whether or not: (<i>a</i>) the LA correctly took cognizance of this case; and (<i>b</i>) AICI is liable for respondents' illegal dismissal. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> Preliminarily, it bears stressing that AICI does not assail the CA's ruling of illegal dismissal but instead, argues that the LA incorrectly took cognizance of the case at the onset. It insists that based on the dispute settlement provision in respondents' employment contracts, the "primary jurisdiction" to decide this case is with the "[Labor] Attache or any [authorized] representative of the Philippine[] Embassy nearest the site of employment" (designated person).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> After a judicious review of the case, the Court denies the petition. </p><p> Section 10 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8042,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as amended by RA 10022,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> explicitly provides that <strong>LAs have original and exclusive</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><strong> jurisdiction over claims arising out of employer-employee relations or by virtue of any law or contract involving Filipino workers for overseas deployment</strong>, as in this case. The relevant portion of the provision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 10. <i>Money Claims</i>. – <strong>Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Labor Arbiters</strong> of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) <strong>shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide</strong>, within ninety (90) calendar days after filing of the complaint, <strong>the claims arising out of</strong> an employer-employee relationship or by virtue of any law or <strong>contract involving Filipino workers for overseas deployment</strong> including claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages. x x x (Emphases supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Settled is the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and cannot be acquired or waived by agreement of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> As herein applied, the dispute settlement provision in respondents' employment contracts cannot divest the LA of its jurisdiction over the illegal dismissal case. Hence, it correctly took cognizance of the complaint filed by respondents before it.</p><p> Moreover, issues not raised in the previous proceedings cannot be raised for the first time at a late stage. In this case, the Court observes that AICI failed to raise the issue of respondents' supposed non-compliance with the dispute settlement provision before the LA, as well as before the NLRC. In fact, AICI only mentioned this issue for the first time before the CA in its motion for reconsideration. Therefore, such argument or defense is deemed waived and can no longer be considered on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Hence, the Court rules that the LA properly took cognizance of this case.</p><p> However, the Court deems it essential to point out that in resolving whether the LA had jurisdiction over this case, the CA erroneously assumed that the designated person in the dispute settlement provision is a Voluntary Arbitrator under the auspices of the Labor Code, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p>It is true that the Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators can hear and decide all other labor disputes including unfair labor practices and bargaining deadlocks upon agreement of the parties. But if the parties wish to submit termination disputes to voluntary arbitration, such an agreement must be stated "in unequivocal language." In the present case, the agreement of the parties was written in this manner: </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> It is, however, not sufficient to merely say that the parties agree on the principle that "all disputes" should first be submitted to a Voluntary Arbitrator. There is a need for an express stipulation that illegal termination disputes should be resolved by a Voluntary Arbitrator or Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, since the same fall within a special class of disputes that are generally within the exclusive [and] original jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters by express provision of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> To clarify, the Voluntary Arbitrator<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> under the Labor Code is one agreed upon by the parties to resolve certain disputes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and is tasked to render an award or decision within twenty (20) calendar days pursuant to Article 276 of the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This decision shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> In this case, the dispute settlement provision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> 14. Settlement of disputes: All claims and complaints relative to the employment contract of the employee shall be settled in accordance with Company policies, rules[,] and regulations. In case the Employee contests the decision of the employer, the matter shall be settled amicably <b>with <u>[the] participation</u> of the Labour Attaché or any authorised representative of the Philippines Embassy nearest the site of employment</b>. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, the mechanism contemplated herein is an amicable settlement whereby the parties can negotiate with each other; it is not a voluntary arbitration under the Labor Code wherein a third party renders a decision to resolve the dispute. The text of the contractual provision shows that the designated person is tasked merely to <i>participate</i> in the amicable settlement and not to <i>decide</i> the dispute. This participation is in line with the mandate of Filipinos Resource Centers, in which labor attachés are members, to engage in the "conciliation of disputes arising from employer-employee relationship."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Hence, the "[Labor] Attaché or any [authorized] representative of the Philippine[] Embassy nearest the site of employment" was not called upon to act as a Voluntary Arbitrator as contemplated under the Labor Code. It was therefore erroneous for the CA to assume that the contractual provision triggered the voluntary arbitration mechanism under the Labor Code and, on that premise, venture into an inquiry as to whether or not there was an "express stipulation" submitting the termination dispute to such process, which thereby puts the case beyond the ambit of the LA's jurisdiction.</p><p> Considering that the parties did not submit the present illegal termination case to the voluntary arbitration mechanism, the dispute remained under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the LA, which therefore correctly took cognizance of the case. Hence, the Court modifies the CA's ruling on this matter accordingly.</p><p> On the second issue, AICI argues in its petition that it cannot be held liable for illegal dismissal because it only recruits employees for foreign employers, and as such, it does not have an employee-employer relationship with the overseas workers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> This argument does not hold water. Section 10 of RA 8042, as amended; expressly provides that a recruitment agency, such as AICI, is solidarily liable with the foreign employer for money claims arising out of the employee-employer relationship between the latter and the overseas Filipino worker.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Jurisprudence explains that this solidary liability is meant to assure the aggrieved worker of immediate and sufficient payment of what is due him,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as well as to afford overseas workers an additional layer of protection against foreign employers that tend to violate labor laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In view of the express provision of law, AICI's lack of an employee-employer relationship with respondents cannot exculpate it from its liability to pay the latter's money claims. </p><p> Nevertheless, AICI is not left without a remedy. The law does not preclude AICI from going after the foreign employer for reimbursement of any payment it has made to respondents to answer for the money claims against the foreign employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.

However, said provision had been superseded by RA 8042 which defined the roles and responsibilities of different government agencies involved in the protection of migrant workers. Nevertheless, under RA 8042, labor attaches remain active in protecting migrant workers as a member of the Filipinos Resources Center.

Cabiles</i>, 740 Phil. 403, 445 (2014), wherein the Court elucidated on this point further, to wit: "[i]n overseas employment, the filing of money claims against the foreign employer is attended by practical and legal complications. The distance of the foreign employer alone makes it difficult for an overseas worker to reach it and make it liable for violations of the Labor Code. There are also possible conflict of laws, jurisdictional issues, and procedural rules that may be raised to frustrate an overseas worker's attempt to advance his or her claims. x x x x The fundamental effect of joint and several liability is that 'each of the debtors is liable for the entire obligation.' A final determination may, therefore, be achieved even. if only one of the joint and several debtors are impleaded in an action. Hence, in the case of overseas employment, either the local agency or the foreign employer may be sued for all claims arising from the foreign employer's labor law violations. This way, the overseas workers are assured that someone – the foreign employer's local agent – may be made to answer for violations that the foreign employer may have committed." See also <i>ATCI Overseas Corporation v. Echin</i>, 647 Phil. 43 (2010); and <i>Sevillana v. I.T.

Cabiles</i>, id. at 446, wherein the Court held thus: "[a] further implication of making local agencies jointly and severally liable with the foreign employer is that an additional layer of protection is afforded to overseas workers. Local agencies, which are businesses by nature, are inoculated with interest in being always on the lookout against foreign employers that tend to violate labor law. Lest they risk their reputation or finances, local agencies must already have mechanisms for guarding against unscrupulous foreign employers even at the level prior to overseas employment applications."</p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> See id. </p></div>
