Dalit further alleged that he had been remitting a portion of the proceeds of the harvest to Balagtas, Sr. as part of the tenurial arrangement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> To support his allegations, Dalit cited the <em>Pagpapatunay</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> issued by the Barangay Captain and President of the Samahang Nayon of Barangay Kalikid Sur, and the <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> executed by the farmers<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the adjoining lots, confirming the existence of the tenurial arrangement. </p><p> Dalit alleged that the Balagtas family later mortgaged the Disputed Lot in favor of Metrobank without his consent, in order to secure an P8,000,000.00 loan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The Balagtas family defaulted, leading to the foreclosure of the mortgage constituted over the Disputed Lot and the consolidation of title in Metrobank's name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Subsequently, the Balagtas family directed Dalit to vacate the Disputed Lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> In his Answer <i>Ad Cautelam,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Rolando, Sr. denied that Dalit had been instituted as tenant farmer of the Disputed Lot, and claimed that he was merely employed as bulldozer and street roller operator during the construction of a memorial park constituted thereon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Further, Rolando, Sr. assailed the PARAD's jurisdiction, claiming that the Disputed Lot had already been classified as residential property, as stated in Tax Declaration No. 02927<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> issued in favor of the Balagtas family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> For its part, Metrobank insisted on its right to take possession of the Disputed Lot as the new registered owner, and echoed Rolando, Sr.'s position anent PARAD's lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> In his Reply, Dalit assailed the veracity of Tax Declaration No. 02927 by presenting a Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated May 31, 2005 issued by Lourdes DL. Calamanan, Records Officer III of the Office of the City Assessor of Cabanatuan City (OCA-Cabanatuan). The Certification states that Tax Declaration No. 02927 does not appear in the records of the OCA-Cabanatuan, and is "null and void" for having been issued under a forged signature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> To bolster his claim, Dalit presented a certified true copy of the<em> actual tax</em> declaration covering the Disputed Lot which indicates that it is still classified as rice land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> On June 7, 2006 the PARAD, through Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator Walter R. Carantes, issued a Decision declaring Dalit as lawful tenant of the Disputed Lot, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered maintaining [Dalit] in his peaceful possession and cultivation of the premises and declaring further his status as a tenant thereon. </p> <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <b>Notably, only Metrobank filed an appeal with the DARAB Central Office</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The appeal was granted by the latter in its Decision dated June 14, 2007 reversing the findings of the PARAD, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the assailed decision is hereby <strong>REVERSED</strong> and <strong>SET ASIDE</strong> and [a] new judgment is rendered declaring [Dalit] <strong>not a <em>de jure</em> tenant of the [Disputed Lot] and ordering his ejectment thereon</strong> (sic). </p> <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Additional emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Dalit filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which was denied by the DARAB Central Office in its Resolution dated April 10, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p><i>CA Proceedings</i> </p><p>Aggrieved, Dalit filed a petition for review before the CA (CA Petition) <em>via</em> Rule 43.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p>Dalit argued that Metrobank's appeal was defective since it was not supported by a board resolution showing that its counsel was duly authorized to file the appeal on its behalf. While Metrobank later attempted to correct this error by presenting the necessary board resolution after Dalit had filed his Motion for Dismissal of the Appeal, he argues that such belated attempt was inconsequential as it was done after the lapse of Metrobank's period to appeal. Proceeding therefrom, Dalit asserted that the PARAD decision had become final and executory, and that the DARAB Central Office erred in entertaining Metrobank's defective appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p>Dalit further maintained that the Balagtas family should be deemed to have admitted his status as tenant, as they failed to deny that they received a portion of the harvest proceeds from him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p>On October 26, 2011, the CA issued the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, the [CA] Petition is <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision and Resolution [are] <b>AFFIRMED</b>. </p> <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On the procedural aspect, the CA found that the relaxation of DARAB's rules of procedure was proper considering that Metrobank had been able to rectify its error by submitting a Special Power of Attorney executed by its Assistant Vice-President Rufo C. Venus, Jr. specifically authorizing its counsel Atty. Edgardo G. Villarin to file, among others, pleadings, motions, petitions, documents and deeds necessary to protect the interest of Metrobank in the instant case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p>On the substantive aspect, the CA held that Dalit failed to adduce substantial evidence to show the establishment of a tenancy relationship. The CA noted that Dalit worked on the Disputed Lot as a hired laborer of the Balagtas family, tasked to operate the latter's bulldozer and street roller. In this connection, the CA held that the <i>Pagpapatunay</i> and <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> presented by Dalit do not suffice to establish a tenancy relationship, for while these documents confirm that Dalit worked on the Disputed Lot, they do not prove that such work was in the nature of personal cultivation, or that the Balagtas family agreed to merely share in the harvest arising therefrom.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> On this score, the CA held that working on another's landholding, without more, "does not raise a presumption of the existence of agricultural tenancy".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Dalit filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied in the assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated June 27, 2012. </p><p>Based on the records, Dalit received the assailed Resolution on July 11, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p>On July 26, 2012, Dalit filed a motion for extension<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> seeking an additional period of thirty (30) days from July 26, 2012, or until August 24, 2012 to file his Petition. This motion was granted by the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> Finally, Dalit filed the present Petition on the last day of the extension prayed for, impleading the Balagtas family and Metrobank as parties. </p><p>In addition to the issues he raised before the CA, Dalit now alleges that the CA erred when it effectively granted the Balagtas family relief through the assailed Decision and Resolution, considering that they did not file an appeal to question the PARAD's Decision. </p><p> In any case, <b>Dalit further claims that supervening events have rendered moot respondents' claim over the Disputed Lot</b>, particularly: </p><ol><li> The issuance of a Notice of Coverage (NOC) dated March 31, 2008 placing the Disputed Lot within the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP);<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]<br><br></sup> </li><li> The cancellation of Metrobank's TCT No. T-96104<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and subsequent issuance of TCT No. 141677<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> in the name of the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) in its stead on September 19, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]<br><br></sup> </li><li> The division and subsequent distribution of the Disputed Lot through the issuance of Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) on October 20, 2011 in favor of several agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) chosen by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), one of whom is Dalit;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and <br><br></li><li> The finality of the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of the DAR Regional Office dated August 8, 2012 denying the Balagtas family's Petition for the Lifting of the Coverage of the Land Under the Agrarian Reform Program, as evidenced by the Certificate of Finality<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> dated December 6, 2012, issued by the DAR Regional Director.</li></ol> <p> In this regard, Dalit insists that a re-evaluation of the assailed Decision and Resolution is in order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p>Metrobank filed its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> on November 14, 2012, to which Dalit filed his Reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p>On March 13, 2013, the Balagtas family filed a Manifestation of Compliance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> stating that they adopt the Comment and other pleadings submitted by Metrobank in the present case. </p><p>On June 3, 2013, the Court directed the parties to file their respective memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p>On August 8, 2013, the Balagtas family filed a Second Manifestation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> stating its intention to adopt all pleadings to be filed by Metrobank. </p><p>Subsequently, Metrobank and Dalit filed their memoranda on August 28, 2013<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and February 13, 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> respectively. </p><p align="center"> <i>The Issues</i> </p><p>The Petition calls on the Court to resolve the following issues: </p><ol><li> Whether the CA erred when it held that Dalit failed to establish his status as a <em>de jure</em> tenant of the Disputed Lot; and <br><br> </li><li>Whether the supervening events cited by Dalit render respondents' claim to the Disputed Lot moot. </li></ol> <p align="center"><i>The Court's Ruling</i> </p><p>The Petition is meritorious. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Dalit's right of possession arises from CLOA No. T-2165</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (CARL) was enacted to facilitate "a more equitable distribution and ownership of land, with due regard to the rights of landowners to just compensation and to the ecological needs of the nation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> In essence, the CARL implements the CARP of the Republic.

BALAGTAS married to CARMELITA G. BALAGTAS, Rolando G. Balagtas, Jr., single and Clarina Balagtas of Kalikid [S]ur, Cabanatuan City dated November 15, 1996 with ARP no. 02927 should be considered NULL and VOID, because of its nature as being made under bad faith.</p> <p> Our good office does not have any record as what (sic) is stated in the fake Tax Declaration with the forge (sic) signature of the Officer's name in the document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Notably, neither the Balagtas family nor Metrobank presented documentary evidence to refute the veracity of OCA-Cabanatuan's Certification.

More specifically[,] the following lands are covered by the [CARP] x x x all private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that can be raised thereon."</p> <p> Applying the foregoing dictum of the law in the instant case, while the protestants argued that the land is for [a] memorial project and x x x is residential in nature, no evidence was ever adduced to support such contention. </p> <p> <b>On the contrary, the findings of the MARO that the property is indeed agriculturally productive, not to mention that there are occupants/farmers found thereon, remained uncontroverted. As between the undisputed findings of the field office concerned and the bare allegations of the [Balagtas family], the former prevails. </b>This is because the field offices concerned being the implementors of agrarian laws and thus possessed (sic) the necessary expertise in such field of endeavor, ergo, their findings should be accorded respect absent x x x any showing of fraud committed in the performance thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court has accorded great weight and respect to the factual findings of administrative bodies<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> in the absence of any showing of fraud, collusion, arbitrariness, illegality, imposition or mistake on the part of administrative officials, or a total lack of substantial evidence to support the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> This principle finds emphatic application in this case, since the DAR's findings as to the classification of the Disputed Lot were no longer questioned by respondents, and thus, became final.</p><p> Under Executive Order No. 229,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> DAR shall exercise "quasi-judicial powers to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction <b>over all matters involving implementation of agrarian reform</b>, except those falling under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the [Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)] and the Department of Agriculture (DA)."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In such cases, "[a]ll doubts should be resolved in favor of the DAR, since the law has granted it special and original authority to hear and adjudicate agrarian matters."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> One of the modes by which DAR implements the distribution of agricultural lands under the CARP is through the issuance of a CLOA.

However, this attempt fails.</p><p> It bears to stress that the Decision subject of the Writ of Execution had been issued <em>prior</em> to: (i) the issuance of the NOC placing the Disputed Lot under the coverage of the CARP; and (ii) the consequent issuance of CLOAs covering the same. In other words, these events, having come after the Decision, had the effect of superseding the orders and directives made by the RTC in its Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p><p> In this regard, it cannot be gainsaid that the State recognizes the indefeasibility of CLOAs issued in accordance with applicable law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Under DAR Administrative Order No. 07-14,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the cancellation of erroneously issued CLOAs may be allowed only in the manner and under the conditions prescribed thereunder. <b>Until duly cancelled in accordance with the prescribed procedure, CLOAs issued by the DAR shall remain valid and subsisting and enjoy the same respect accorded to those issued through other modes of acquisition of title.</b></p><p> To recall, the Balagtas family's Petition for the Lifting of the Coverage of the Land Under the Agrarian Reform Program had already been denied with finality, as evidenced by the Certificate of Finality issued by the DAR Regional Director on December 6, 2012. <b>Hence, the issuance of the Writ of Execution directing the enforcement of the RTC's superseded Decision cannot defeat CLOA No. T-2165 which, as explained, is already valid and subsisting by virtue of the denial with finality of the Balagtas family's petition.</b></p><p> In view of the foregoing, the Court deems it unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised in the Petition.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

Balagtas filed before the Department of Agrarian Reform, Regional Office III a protest against the issuance of the notice of coverage over the subject lot, which was, however, denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated August 8, 2012 that became final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> May I add the following observations: </p><p> <b><u>First</u>. <em>It is but proper to maintain Dalit in the possession of the subject lot as a consequence of his CLOA title</em>.</b> It bears stressing that the rights and responsibilities of ARBs shall commence from their receipt of duly <u>registered CLOAs</u> and their <u>actual physical possession</u> of the awarded land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Under Section 24<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of Republic Act No. (RA) 6657,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> as amended by RA 9700,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> identified and qualified ARBs shall have <u>usufructuary rights over the awarded land as soon as the PAR takes possession of such land, and even pending the award of the CLOA</u>. Consequently, Dalit must be maintained in the peaceful possession of the subject lot as a consequence of his CLOA title, <b>until such title is cancelled for valid reasons.</b> </p><p> <b><u>Second</u>. <em>It must be clarified that the issue of whether or not an ARB is a dejure tenant on a CARP-covered lot is <u>not </u>necessarily rendered moot by the mere issuance of a CLOA title in the ARB's name</em>.</b> An action is considered "moot" when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead or when the matter in dispute has already been resolved and hence, one is not entitled to judicial intervention unless the issue is likely to be raised again between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, since the action before the PARAD primarily involves Dalit's right to be maintained in the possession of the subject lot, the issuance of a CLOA title in his name which recognizes his usufructuary rights over the awarded land necessarily entails his continued possession thereof, regardless of whether or not he had valid grounds to be so maintained when he filed the amended petition for maintenance of possession in 2005 long before the issuance of his CLOA title on October 20, 2011. </p><p> Notably, however, <u>it was Dalit himself who raised the issue of tenancy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> in invoking the jurisdiction</u> of the PARAD (DARAB Adjudicator) to maintain him in the possession of the subject lot. Thus, it may be reasonably presumed that his identification as a qualified beneficiary over the subject lot was precipitated by his claim of tenancy thereon. Nonetheless, it bears stressing that despite the indefeasibility and imprescriptibility accorded by law to CLOAs, EPs, and other agrarian titles after one (1) year from their registration with the Office of the Register of Deeds (ROD),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> any material misrepresentation of the ARB's basic qualifications,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> as well as the other grounds mentioned under Sections 4.3 to 4.15 of DAR Administrative Order (AO) No. 07-14,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> is not a bar to a petition for cancellation of such titles filed by any party in interest<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> outside the one-year period. Thus, the tenancy issue continues to find relevance, albeit, must give way to the primacy of Dalit's CLOA in this case, until such title is cancelled for valid reasons. </p><p> Third. While I agree with the <em>ponencia's </em>opinion that the decision and writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. 3361 cannot defeat Dalit's rights arising from TCT No. T-2165<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (<em>i.e</em>., Dalit's CLOA title), the same is <u>irrelevant to the instant case</u>. It must be pointed out that Dalit was not a party to the said case - an action for specific performance with prayer for injunctive relief and damages filed by the Balagtas family against MBTC. While an annotation of<em> lis pendens</em> was carried over<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> to Dalit's CLOA title, the Decision in said case<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> limited itself to the cancellation of MBTC's TCT No. T-96104 and the restoration of the Balagtas family's TCT No. T-82410, without cancelling any derivative title from TCT No. T-96104. Accordingly, unless the cancellation of TCT No. T-2165 is finally secured in an action specifically impleading Dalit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> his right to be maintained in the possession of the subject lot guaranteed by such title must be respected. <br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Dated May 27, 2005. <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 114-117. <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> See id. at 119-120, including dorsal portion. </p> <p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 139, including dorsal portion.</p> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> See id. at 115-116. </p> <p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> See id. at 121. </p> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> See id. at 122-124. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> See id. at 115. </p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> See Answer <em>Ad Cautelam</em> dated April 29, 2005; id. at 130-134. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> See id. at 131. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> See Answer dated July 25, 2005; id. at 136-138-A. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> See id. at 137. </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 64-66.
