Respondents Navares' complaint for reconveyance was not barred by prescription because of their actual possession of Lot No. 8467-B based on petitioners Tomakin's admission that most of respondents Navares are living in the said Lot and leasing portions thereof to tenants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The CA disagreed with the RTC's negation of the transfer of ½ of Lot No. 8467 in favor of respondents Navares based on their alleged failure to adduce evidence that the condition contained in the 1955 Deed of Absolute Sale with Condition (1955 Deed of Sale) in their favor was complied with. Contrary to the ruling of the RTC, the CA did not construe the proviso on the reservation of the right to the fruits or products of the property conveyed by Quirina Badana to respondents Navares' predecessors during her lifetime as a condition on the ground that the 1955 Deed of Sale did not in express terms provide that the non-fulfillment of the obligation to deliver the fruits would prevent the transfer of ownership of the property in question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Even if petitioners Tomakin's argument that the proviso partook of the nature of a condition were to be sustained, the CA stated that they lacked personality to assail the same because they were not privies to the 1955 Deed of Sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> According to the CA, only Quirina Badana, as the vendor, had a cause of action to assail the non-fulfillment of the condition, and her failure to institute any action regarding the alleged condition during her lifetime constituted a waiver of whatever cause of action she might have had thereon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The CA upheld the validity of the February 23, 1955 sale covering the ½ portion of Lot No. 8647 (known as Lot No. 8647-B and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 131499) executed by Quirina Badana in favor of respondents Navares' predecessors and the December 6, 1957 sale executed by Severina Badana in favor of petitioners Tomakin's predecessors but only to the extent of her ½ share of Lot No. 8647.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the Appeal is <b>GRANTED. </b>The Decision, dated 6 May 2010, rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, 7<sup>th</sup> Judicial Region, Cebu City in CIVIL CASE NO.

Hence, the instant Rule 45 Petition. The Court in its July 4, 2016 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> required respondents Navares to comment on the Petition within 10 days from notice thereof. To date, they have not filed any Comment. As such, respondents Navares are deemed to have waived the opportunity to file any Comment on the Petition.<br><br><center><i><b>The Issues</b></i></center><br><br>The Petition raises the following issues:<br><br>1. whether the CA failed to appreciate that respondents Navares' possession was not in the concept of an owner;<br><br>2. whether the CA failed to appreciate the indefeasibility of the Torrens title;<br><br>3. whether the CA failed to appreciate that respondents Navares in not previously filing a case for declaration of heirship as heirs of spouses Remegio Navares and Cesaria Gaviola have no cause of action against petitioners Tomakin; and<br><br>4. whether the CA failed to appreciate that respondents Navares are guilty of laches.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><i><b>The Court's Ruling</b></i></center><br><br>The Petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Review by the Supreme Court via a Rule 45 <i>certiorari </i>petition is not a matter of right, but involves sound judicial discretion because it will be granted only when there are special and important reasons therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Petitioners Tomakin have failed to convince the Court that their Petition is justified by special and important reasons to warrant the granting thereof.<br><br>The grounds relied upon by petitioners Tomakin in the Petition are the very same arguments that they raised in their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> before the CA, which the latter found to be without merit in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated March 23, 2016.<br><br>Anent the first issue, the Court quotes with approbation the CA's explanation why it was not persuaded by petitioners Tomakin's argument that respondents Navares' possession of the subject property is not in the concept of an owner, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>[Petitioners Tomakin] assert, [respondents Navares'] possession of the property is not in the concept of an owner.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>In <i>[Sps.] Alfredo v. [Sps.] Borras,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court ruled that prescription does not run against the plaintiff in actual possession of the disputed land because such plaintiff has a right to wait until his possession is disturbed or his title is questioned before initiating an action to vindicate his right. His undisturbed possession gives him the continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to determine the nature of the adverse claim of a third party and its effect on his title. The Court held that where the plaintiff in an action for reconveyance remains in possession of the subject land, the action for reconveyance becomes in effect an action to quiet title to property, which is not subject to prescription.<br><br>The action for reconveyance was filed by [respondents Navares] precisely because they deemed themselves owner of the litigated property prior to the claim of [petitioners Tomakin]. The filing of such action was an assertion of their title to the property. Thus, the question of whether or not [respondents Navares] are in possession of the subject property in the concept of an owner is a question of fact; and such question of fact has already been resolved by this Court in Our Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Regarding the second issue, petitioners Tomakin argue that the complaint for reconveyance filed by respondents Navares involves a collateral attack on the subject certificate of title covering Lot No. 8647-B. They invoke Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 or the Property Registration Decree, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 48. <i>Certificate not subject to collateral attack. – </i>A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law.</blockquote><br><br>Contrary to petitioners Tomakin's postulation, respondents Navares availed themselves of the correct remedy of reconveyance. The Court in <i>The Director of Lands v. The Register of Deeds for the Province of Rizal</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> stated that: "[t]he sole remedy of the land owner whose property has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in another's name is, after one year from the date of the decree, not to set aside the decree x x x, but, respecting the decree as incontrovertible and no longer open to review, to bring an ordinary action in the ordinary court of justice for reconveyance or, if the property has passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, for damages."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Proceeding to the third issue, petitioners Tomakin belatedly raised the same in their Motion for Reconsideration before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> They never raised in their Answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the ground that respondents Navares have no cause of action against them because the former had not previously filed a petition for declaration of heirship as heirs of spouses Remigio Navares and Cesaria Gaviola.<br><br>The third issue may no longer be raised by petitioners Tomakin on appeal.<br><br>Firstly, it is well-settled that a party may not change his theory of the case on appeal and this is expressly adopted in Section 15, Rule 44 of the Rules, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 15. <i>Questions that may be raised on appeal. – </i>Whether or not the appellant has filed a motion for new trial in the court below, he may include in his assignment of errors any question of law or fact that has been raised in the court below and which is within the issues framed by the parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Pre-Trial Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of petitioners Tomakin raised only the following issues: (1) whether respondents Navares are the owners of Lot No. 8467-B; (2) whether the present action is barred by prescription; and (3) whether petitioners Tomakin are entitled to their counterclaims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The RTC Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated May 6, 2010 framed the issues to be resolved as follows: (1) whether the present action is barred by prescription; (2) whether respondents Navares are the owners of Lot No. 8467 by right of succession; and (3) whether petitioners Tomakin are entitled to their counterclaims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the third issue was not raised by petitioners Tomakin before the RTC. As such, this may no longer be raised nor ruled upon on appeal.<br><br>Secondly, defenses not pleaded in the answer may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Citing <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mirant Pagbilao Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Remedial Law Author and Reviewer Willard B. Riano explains:<br><br><blockquote>x x x A party cannot, on appeal, change fundamentally the nature of the issue in the case. When a party deliberately adopts a certain theory and the case is decided upon that theory in the court below, he will not be permitted to change the same on appeal, because to permit him to do so would be unfair to the adverse party. Accordingly, "courts of justice have no jurisdiction or power to decide a question not in issue." Thus, a judgment that goes beyond the issues and purports to adjudicate something on which the court did not hear the parties, is not only irregular but also extrajudicial and invalid. The rule rests on the fundamental tenets of fair play[, justice and due process<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Thirdly, it is also well-settled that issues raised for the first time on appeal and not raised in the proceedings in the lower court are barred by estoppel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing, the Court cannot pass upon the third issue.<br><br>On the fourth issue, respondents Navares, having been in possession of and exercising acts of dominion over the subject property as found by the CA, cannot be deemed to be guilty of laches because they cannot be said to have omitted or neglected to assert and exercise their rights as owner thereof. Pursuant to <i>Sps. Alfredo v. Sps. Borras</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> cited by the CA in its Resolution dated March 23, 2016, the undisturbed possession of respondents Navares give them the continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to determine the nature of the adverse claim of petitioners Tomakin and its effect on their ownership of Lot No. 8467-B.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED. </b>The Decision dated October 28, 2014 and the Resolution dated March 23, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
