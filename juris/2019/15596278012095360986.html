Hearing was then reset to January 7, 2009, then to April 7, 2009 and to May 19, 2009 upon the instance of Choi. The case was again rescheduled to August 5, 2009, but the same was again declared a holiday. On September 15, 2010, Choi asked for postponement on the ground that he needed the assistance of an interpreter to assist him in translating his testimony from Korean to English.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> The MeTC granted Choi's request to reset the hearing from September 15, 2010 to November 23, 2010 in an <i>Order</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> issued the same day.

The MeTC cautioned Choi that should he still be not ready by the next hearing, his right to present evidence would be considered waived.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p>Despite the warning, on the scheduled hearing of March 7, 2011, Choi asked for yet another postponement on the ground that his previous counsel was retired from the practice of law and his new counsel was not prepared for the day's hearing. On that day, Park objected to further postponement of the case considering that the last two postponements had already come with the court's warning against further postponements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Ruling on what was by then the sixth motion for postponement by Choi, the MeTC, in an <em>Order</em> dated March 7, 2011, <strong>denied </strong>Choi's motion for postponement and declared that his right to present evidence had been waived. Accordingly, the MeTC ruled that the case was submitted for resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p>Subsequently, on <b>April 26, 2011</b>, the MeTC, rendered a <em>Decision</em> finding Choi civilly liable to Park, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, Eung Won Choi is ordered to pay private complainant Hun Hyung Park the amount of P1,875,000.00 representing the face value of the check subject of this case plus interest of 12% percent <em>per annum</em> from August 31, 2000 until the whole amount is paid, the amount of P200,000.00 by way of attorney's fees, and the amount of P9,322.25 as reimbursement for the filing fees.</p> <p> Costs against the accused.</p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Insofar as Choi's alleged indebtedness was concerned, the MeTC held that the prosecution had proven that the check subject matter of the case was issued by Choi to Park in exchange of the cash loaned to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Choi, on the other hand, did not even adduce any evidence to controvert Park's claim of indebtedness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Consequently, finding that Choi had no valid defense against Park's claim of indebtedness, the MeTC held that Choi was civilly liable to Park for the loan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> On Choi's repeated motions for postponement, the MeTC observed that: </p><blockquote> <p> As early as May 12, 2008, the defense was ordered to present its evidence. In the interim, the parties negotiated for the settlement of the case. The reception of defense evidence was postponed on several dates to accommodate the alleged negotiation for the settlement of the case as well as due to the unavailability of a Korean interpreter to aid the accused.</p> <p> In the Order of September 15, 2010, the defense was given one last chance to present evidence on November 23, 2010. Accused again failed to present its evidence. In order to afford the accused his constitutional right to defend himself and to present evidence, he was again given one last chance to present evidence on March 7, 2011. On said date, the handling lawyer, sent his son, Atty. Rainald Paggao, who manifested that his father can no longer handle the case. On the same day, Atty. Jesus F. Fernandez verbally entered his appearance as new counsel for the accused. Atty. Fernandez moved for a resetting of the case, which the Court denied considering the objection of the private prosecutor, as well as due to the repeated warnings issued, and considering further the length of time afforded the accused to present its (sic) evidence. The defense right (sic) to present evidence was deemed waived and the case was considered submitted for resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Unsatisfied, Choi appealed the above MeTC <em>Decision</em> dated April 26, 2011 to the RTC - Branch 142.</p> <p> <b><i>The Ruling of the RTC - Branch 142</i></b> </p><p> In its <em>Decision</em>, dated <b>December 23, 2011</b>, the RTC - Branch 142 <b>affirmed</b> the MeTC <em>Decision</em> and <b>denied</b> Choi's appeal, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> All told, this Court finds that the imposition of civil liability against the accused-appellant is correctly decided by the lower court. </p> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b> and the <em>Decision</em> dated 26 April 2011, rendered by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 65, Makati City is <b>AFFIRMED IN TOTO</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>In this regard, the RTC - Branch 142 observed that:</p> <blockquote> <p> In the 15 September 2010 Order of the lower [court], [Choi] was already given the last opportunity to present his defense on 23 November 2010, but still failed to introduce any.

Justice dictates, therefore, that the Court resolve the present petition instead of remanding the same to the lower court. In this regard, the Court finds that the CA <b>erred</b> in reversing the RTC - Branch 142) <em>Decision</em> dated December 23, 2011 and Order dated March 28, 2012, for the reasons that follow. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Contrary to the CA's ruling, Choi was not deprived of due process.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The totality of circumstances painstakingly detailed above reveals that Choi was not deprived of due process, either: (i) in the MeTC <i>Order</i> dated March 7, 2011, as affirmed by the RTC - Branch 142, declaring Choi to have waived his right to present evidence after he moved for a sixth postponement; or (ii) in the RTC - Branch 142 <em>Order</em> dated March 28, 2012 denying his Motion for Reconsideration two days before the lapse of the ten (10) day period given to him by the RTC to file his <em>Reply to the Opposition (to the Motion for Reconsideration).</em> </p><p> <b><i>First</i></b>, contrary to the ruling of the CA, the MeTC, as affirmed by the RTC - Branch 142, was correct in ruling that Choi had waived his right to present evidence.</p><p> Claiming that substantive justice must be the determinative end of courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Choi argues that any grant of postponement must take into consideration the reason for the postponement and the merits of the case of the movant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> To that extent, the Court agrees, and so holds, that Choi had been provided with more than ample opportunity to present his case.</p><p> To begin with, the grant or denial of a motion - or, in this case, motions - for postponement is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, which should always be predicated on the consideration that the ends of justice and fairness are served by the grant or denial of the motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> As the Court enunciated in <i>Sibay v. Bermudez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> x x x After all, postponements and continuances are part and parcel of our procedural system of dispensing justice. When no substantial rights are affected and the intention to delay is not manifest with the corresponding motion to transfer the hearing having been filed accordingly, it is sound judicial discretion to allow the same to the end that the merits of the case may be fully ventilated. Thus, in considering motions for postponements, two things must be borne in mind: (1) the reason for the postponement, and (2) the merits of the case of the movant. Unless grave abuse of discretion is shown, such discretion will not be interfered with either by <em>mandamus</em> or appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> <b><u>Because it is a matter of privilege, not a right, a movant for postponement should not assume beforehand that his motion will be granted</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></p> <p> Thus, We agree with the appellate court's finding that <b>in the absence of any clear and manifest grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or in excess of jurisdiction</b>, We cannot overturn the decision of the court <em>a quo.</em> More so, in this case, where the denial of the motion for postponement appears to be justified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In fact, pursuant to Sections 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and 3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> of Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, although a court may adjourn a trial from day to day, a motion to postpone trial on the ground of absence of evidence can be granted only upon affidavit showing the materiality or relevancy of such evidence, and that due diligence has been used to procure it. Rules governing postponements serve a clear purpose — to avert the erosion of people's confidence in the judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></p><p> Consequently, in granting or denying motions for postponements, courts must exercise their discretion constantly mindful of the Constitutional guarantee against unreasonable delay in the disposition of cases. In other words, while it is true that cases must be adjudicated in a manner that is in accordance with the established rules of procedure, so is it crucial that cases be promptly disposed to better serve the ends of justice. After all, justice delayed is justice denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Excessive delay in the disposition of cases renders inutile the rights of the people guaranteed by the constitution and by various legislations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></p><p> Here, Choi bewails the MeTC <em>Order</em> dated March 7, 2011 in which the court, after several warnings, declared Choi to have waived his right to present evidence. The facts leading up to the MeTC<em> Order </em>dated March 7, 2011, however, clearly show that the MeTC had been very liberal in granting Choi's numerous motions for postponement, each time reminding Choi to come prepared to present his evidence. In all these, Choi's propensity to disregard the opportunity given to him to present his evidence is palpable.</p><p> To be clear, trial was initially scheduled on <strong>July 16, 2008</strong>. After four motions for postponement (July 16, 2008 to January 7, 2009, then to April 7, 2009, then to May 19, 2009, and to September 15, 2010) at Choi's instance, trial was set to proceed on <strong>September 15, 2010</strong>. Come September 15, 2010, however, Choi again moved that the trial be postponed to <strong>November 23, 2010</strong>, asking for the first time the assistance of an interpreter in translating his testimony from Korean to English.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></p><p> While the lower court granted Choi's by then sixth postponement, it did so with a stern warning that his failure to present evidence on the scheduled date would result in his right to present evidence being deemed waived. Yet, on <strong>November 23, 2010</strong>, Choi again moved for postponement on the excuse that the Korean Interpreter who was present to assist him had an erroneous certification (<em>i.e</em>., was a Certified Qualified Interpreter, but the <em>Certification</em> issued by the Korean embassy was for another case). Using the certification issue as reason, Choi again asked that the trial be postponed to <b>March 7, 2011</b>. On that day, Choi's counsel moved for another postponement on the ground that Choi's previous counsel was retiring and this new counsel was not prepared to present evidence that day.</p><p> Based on the foregoing, it does not escape the Court's attention that from the time the MeTC gave Choi the opportunity to present his evidence on July 16, 2008 until the issuance of the MeTC <em>Order</em> dated March 7, 2011 declaring Choi's right to present evidence to have been waived, Choi had been given several opportunities — spanning almost three (3) years — to present his evidence.</p><p> There is no deprivation of due process when a party is given an opportunity to be heard, not only through hearings, but even through pleadings, so that one may explain one's side or arguments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Inasmuch as Choi had been given more than enough opportunity to present his case, the Court agrees with the MeTC and the RTC that Choi had waived his right to present evidence. In this regard, Choi cannot claim that he was "prevented from testifying"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> by the trial court, considering that all the postponements in the proceedings were at the instance of Choi.</p><p> In any event, the unpreparedness of counsel that led to the MeTC Order of March 7, 2011 cannot, by any stretch of imagination, justify further delay in the proceedings to the detriment of Park's right to an expeditious resolution of what really is, at the end of the day, a simple money claim.</p><p> <b><i>Second</i></b>, that the RTC - Branch 142 denied Choi's Motion for Reconsideration on March 28, 2012, or two days before the lapse of the ten (10) day period given to Choi by the RTC to file his <em>Reply to the Opposition (to the Motion for Reconsideration) </em>does not, by and of itself, support Choi's claim of a violation of due process considering that, to begin with, the <em>Reply to Opposition</em> is limited to issues and arguments raised in Park's <em>Opposition</em>, which in turn, is limited to the issues and arguments raised in Choi's own Motion for Reconsideration. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Choi is liable to pay Park the principal amount of P1,875,000.00 and corresponding legal interests thereon.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Having dispensed with the procedural issues, the Court proceeds to determine the extent of Choi's liability to Park. </p><p> Suffice it to state that based on the records, it is clear that Choi is liable to Park for the loan extended by the latter to him. This is so because, Choi in his <em>Counter-Affidavit</em>, already admitted that he borrowed money from Park, arguing only regarding the <em>extent</em> of his liability — <em>i.e.</em>, that what he owed was P1,500,000.00 and not P1,875,000.00. In his <em>Counter-Affidavit</em>, Choi himself stipulated: </p><blockquote> <p> "2. That the truth of the matter is that <b><u>I borrowed from said complainant the amount of P1,500,000.00 on June 29, 1999</u></b> and he thereupon issued to me two (2) International Bank Manager's Checks, to wit:</p> <blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="57%">IEB Check No. 01022 6/29/99</td> <td width="5%">-</td> <td width="38%">P1,000,000.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>IEB Check No. 01023 6/29/99</td> <td>-</td> <td><u>[P]500,000.00</u></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><div>Total: </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>P1,500,000.00<br> ==========</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>3. That in place of a formal document such as a promissory note, [Park] required me instead to give him the subject check in the amount of P1,875,000.00 which includes the interest of Twenty-Five percent (25%) which is equivalent to P375,000.00 and the date of said check of August 28, 1999 served to indicate the maturity date of the two-month period within which the aforementioned loan was to be paid. In other words, the subject check was not intended by us to be in payment of the loan but to serve merely as an evidence of my indebtedness to the complaint in lieu of a promissory note as I have duly informed the complainant of the lack of sufficient funds to cover the same check when I handed over to him that check.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Judicial admissions made by parties in the course of the trial in the same case are conclusive and do not require further evidence to prove them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> They are legally binding on the party making them<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> except when it is shown that they have been made through palpable mistake, or that no such admission was made,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> neither of which was shown to exist in this case. Thus, Choi himself having admitted liability, the only question that remains for the Court to resolve is the extent of such liability.</p><p> In this regard, the Court finds that Choi is liable to pay Park the face value of the check in the amount of P1,875,000.00 as principal. The Court notes that the only bases relied upon by Choi in support of his contention that P1,500,000.00 is the principal and P375,000.00 to be the interest are his own allegations in his <em>Counter-Affidavit</em>. Without more, Choi's bare allegations on the terms of the loan fail to persuade. This is so because in accordance with Article 1956 of the Civil Code, no interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Here, without further proof of any express agreement that P375,000.00 of the P1,875,000.00 pertains to interest, the Court is predisposed, based on the facts of the case, to rule that the entire principal amount owed by Choi to Park is the face value of the check, or P1,875,000.00.</p><p> In an attempt to further minimize liability, Choi raises the defense of payment and insists that he already paid the sum of P1,590,000.00 (P1,500,000.00 as principal and P90,000.00 as interest), and that the remaining amount that he owes Park is P285,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> In his <em>Counter-Affidavit</em>, Choi claims: </p><blockquote> <p> "5. That complainant is now demanding still for the payment of the face value of the check which is P1,875,000.00 notwithstanding his awareness of the fact that <b><u>I have already paid to him the total amount of P1,590,000.00 as of this date</u></b>, thereby leaving an unpaid balance of only P285,000.00.</p> <p> 6. That, attached hereto as Annex "A" the LIST of the instalment payments I made to complainant from August 28, 1999 up to February 22, 2000, together with documents evidencing some of such payments, as Annexes "B", "C" and "D"."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Yet, other than mere allegation of payment of P1,590,000.00, Choi has adduced no evidence to prove the fact of payment. A party claiming that an obligation has been discharged by payment has the burden of proving the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> As aptly elucidated by the Court in <i>Alonzo v. San Juan</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The law requires in civil cases that the party who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it. Section 1, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court provides that the burden of proof is the duty of a party to prove the truth of his claim or defense, or any fact in issue by the amount of evidence required by law. In this case, the burden of proof is on the respondents because they allege an affirmative defense, namely payment. <b>As a rule, one who pleads payment has the burden of proving it. Even where the plaintiff must allege [non-payment], the general rule is that the burden rests on the defendant to prove payment, rather than on the plaintiff to prove</b> [<b>non-payment</b>]. The debtor has the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> As against Choi's allegation of payment, Park's categorical testimony that Choi owed him P1,875,000.00, coupled with the presentation of the subject check constituting evidence of indebtedness and absent evidence on the part of Choi to the contrary, leads to the conclusion that Choi in fact owes Park the full amount of P1,875,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></p><p> More importantly, Park, in his <i>Reply-Affidavit</i>, categorically testified that although Choi gave him a check for P1,590,000.00, that amount was not in payment of PNB Check No. 0077133 (the P1,875,000.00 check dated June 28,1999), but was for the payment of PNB Check No. 0077134 in the amount of P750,000.00 dated August 28, 1999 and PNB Check No. 0008013 in the amount of P700,000.00 dated September 7, 1999.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></p><p> Given these facts, as correctly observed by the RTC - Branch 142, if Choi really did make a partial payment on the loan, then he would have taken the check back as debtors would in the ordinary course of business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Quite the contrary, the check for P1,875,000.00 remained in Park's possession who continued to make demands on the basis of the check.</p><p> Finally, even if the Court were to indulge Choi's claim that he handed Park a check for P1,590,000.00, it has not been shown, much less proven, to the satisfaction of the Court whether those payments were made specifically by Choi for the purpose of discharging his loan obligations to Park. As shown in Park's <em>Reply-Affidavit</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> "2. That after I gave him the cash of P1,875,000.00, he gave P100,000.00 to Moo Pyung Park as the latter's commission for bringing him to me; then he handed P196,000.00 to me to pay for and in his behalf the rentals for 14 months of the warehouse he is renting through me from Mr. Tony Arellano located at Cubao, Quezon City; likewise, <b><u>he handed P1,500,000.00 to me to change it to manager's checks which he said he will use in paying Samsung Electric Company which he did not want to pay in cash for fear of bringing that much with him</u></b> and which account (sic) for IEB Checks Nos. 01022 and 01023; and lastly[,] <b><u>he gave me the balance of P69,000.00 in payment on interest on the P1,875,000.00 for two months, i.e., July and August.</u></b></p> <p> 3. That I admit that he had indorsed in my favor several checks from different owners as enumerated in Annex "A" of his counter-affidavit and he had issued two checks in my favor in the sum total of P1,590,000.00 but <u><b>not in payment of the PNB Check No. 0077133 in the amount of P1,875,000.00 he issued to me in June 28, 1999 but of PNB Check No. 0077134 in the amount of P750,000.00 dated August 28, 1999 and the PNB Check No. 0008013 in the amount of P700,000.00 dated September 7, 1999 which he encash</b> (sic) <b>with me also in July 1999</b></u> and which he told me not to present for payment anymore as he will just replace them with other checks. Copies of said checks are hereto attached as Annexes "D" and "E" and made as integral parts hereof."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Given the foregoing, the Court therefore finds that: <b><i>first</i></b>, Choi was not deprived of due process, and was in fact, given more than ample opportunity to present his case; and <em><strong>second</strong></em>, that, as correctly observed by the MeTC and subsequently affirmed by the RTC - Branch 142, Choi is liable to pay Park the amount P1,875,000.00 along with its corresponding legal interest. </p><p> <b>A final note on interest. </b>There are two types of interest - monetary interest and compensatory interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> Interest as a compensation fixed by the parties for the use or forbearance of money is referred to as monetary interest,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> while interest that may be imposed by law or by courts as penalty for damages is referred to as compensatory interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Right to interest therefore arises only by virtue of a contract <i><u>or</u></i> by virtue of damages for delay or failure to pay the principal loan on which interest is demanded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup></p><p> Inasmuch as the parties did not execute a written loan agreement, and consequently, did not stipulate on the imposition of interest, Article 1956 of the Civil Code, which states that "[n]o interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing," operates to preclude the imposition and running of monetary interest on the principal. In other words, no monetary interest having been agreed upon between the parties, none accrues in favor of Park.</p><p> Nevertheless, the moment a debtor incurs in delay in the payment of a sum of money, the creditor is entitled to the payment of interest as indemnity for damages arising out of that delay. Article 2209 of the Civil Code provides that: "[i]f the obligation consists in the payment of sum of money, and the debtor incurs in delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the contrary, shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon, and in the absence of stipulation, the legal interest, which is six percent (6%) <i>per annum</i>."</p><p> Consequently, by operation of Article 2209 of the Civil Code, Choi becomes liable to pay Park <b>compensatory interest</b> to indemnify Park for the damages the latter suffered as a result of Choi's delay in the payment of the loan. Delay in this case, pursuant to Article 1169 of the Civil Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> begins to run from the time Park extrajudicially demanded from Choi the fulfillment of his loan obligation that is, on May 19, 2000. There being no stipulation as to the rate of compensatory interest, the rate is six percent (6%) <em>per annum</em> pursuant to Article 2209 of the Civil Code.</p><p> To be clear, however, Article 2212 of the Civil Code, which provides that "[i]nterest due shall earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded, although the obligation may be silent upon this point," does not apply because "interest due" in Article 2212 refers only to <i>accrued</i> interest. A look at the counterpart provision of Article 2212 of the new Civil Code, Article 1109 of the old Civil Code, supports this. It provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Art. 1109. <b><u>Accrued interest</u></b> shall draw interest at the legal rate from the time the suit is filed for its recovery, even if the obligation should have been silent on this point.</p> <p> In commercial transactions the provisions of the Code of Commerce shall govern.</p> <p> Pawnshops and savings banks shall be governed by their special regulations. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> In interpreting the above provision of the old Civil Code, the Court in <i>Zobel v. City of Manila</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> ruled that Article 1109 applies only to conventional obligations containing a stipulation on interest. Similarly, Article 2212 of the new Civil Code contemplates, and therefore applies, only when there exists stipulated or conventional interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></p><p> Finally, in accordance <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> as further clarified by the Court in <em>Nacar v. Gallery Frames</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> in the absence of an express stipulation as to the rate of interest that would govern the parties, the rate of legal interest for loans or forbearance of any money, goods or credits and the rate allowed in judgments is twelve percent (12%) <i>per annum</i> computed from default (<em>i.e</em>., the date of judicial or extrajudicial demand). With the issuance of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP-MB) Circular No. 799 (s. 2013), said rate of 12% <em>per annum</em> applies until June 30, 2013, and, from July 1, 2013, the new rate of six percent (6%) <i>per annum</i> applies. Finally, when the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest shall be 6% <em>per annum</em> from such finality until its satisfaction, the interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
