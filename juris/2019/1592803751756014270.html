Invoking&nbsp; the&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; in&nbsp; BASECO&nbsp; v.&nbsp; PCGG,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> he&nbsp; argued&nbsp; that,&nbsp; while BASECO was under sequestration&nbsp; by the Presidential Commission&nbsp; on Good Government&nbsp; (PCGG),&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; no&nbsp; divestment&nbsp; of&nbsp; title over&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized property since the PCGG has only powers of administration&nbsp; and that it may not exercise acts of ownership over the property sequestered, frozen or provisionally&nbsp; taken over. Petitioner alleged that he bought one (1) share of stock of the company in 2001 and, thus, he was entitled to be voted upon as member of the Board of Directors (<i>BOD</i>)&nbsp; of BASECO.&nbsp;&nbsp; He theorizes that while the former President intimated her desire to the PCGG that he be made a member of the BOD, the same would not nevertheless&nbsp; have materialized had he not acquired&nbsp; a share of stock in the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was elected as member of the BOD and, eventually,&nbsp; as President of BASECO every year until he was unceremoniously replaced in 2011.<br><br>Petitioner posits that since BASECO is a private corporation under the tutelage of PCGG&nbsp; as conservator&nbsp; and that he was elected to the BOD by reason of his being a stockholder of the company, he cannot be considered as a public official or employee within the definition of Section 2(b) of R.A. No. 3019,&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; known&nbsp; as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Not being a public official or employee, he asserts that the Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over his person and that, consequently, the Office of the Ombudsman also has no jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation against&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Petitioner,&nbsp; thus,&nbsp; concludes&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sandiganbayan&nbsp; gravely abused&nbsp; its&nbsp; discretion&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; denying&nbsp; his&nbsp; Motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; Quash&nbsp; or&nbsp; To&nbsp; Suspend Proceedings&nbsp; dated&nbsp; May&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 2017&nbsp; and&nbsp; Motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; Reconsideration&nbsp; dated October 17, 2017.<br><br>Sought for comment to the present petition, the OSP contend that the Sandiganbayan&nbsp; has jurisdiction&nbsp; over the case and person&nbsp; of petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; It argued that the jurisdiction of a court in criminal cases is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information. Once it is shown that it has jurisdiction,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; may&nbsp; validly&nbsp; take&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and&nbsp; the court's jurisdiction to try a criminal case is determined at the time of the institution of the action, not at the time of the commission&nbsp; of the offense. The&nbsp; OSP&nbsp; insists&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Informations&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner sufficiently state the elements of the crime charged. It points out petitioner's own admission in his Counter-Affidavit dated June 30, 2014 that he was appointed as member of the BOD of BASECO, and later as its President by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.<br><br>It stressed that Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by R.A. No. 10660, enumerates the officials and offenses or felonies cognizable by the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crimes charged against the petitioner, who is a public officer as defined by Section 2 ofP.D. No. 1602, are expressly stated in the Section 4(a) and (b), hence, within the original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to R.A. No. 6770, or The Ombudsman Law, it is the Office of the Ombudsman that has the authority to file the cases against the petitioner with the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The OSP insists&nbsp; hat&nbsp; BASECO is a government-owned or controlled corporation&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>GOCC</i>),&nbsp; as&nbsp; classified&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Governance&nbsp;&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; for GOCCs under the category GOCC 's Supervised by the PCGG.&nbsp; It argues that the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan is not undermined by the fact that BASECO is under sequestration by the PCGG, but instead reinforces the proposition that BASECO&nbsp; is a government entity utilizing public funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It alleged&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; of&nbsp; BASECO's ownership&nbsp; has&nbsp; long&nbsp; been&nbsp; settled&nbsp; as pointed out by the Sandiganbayan&nbsp; in its assailed Resolution&nbsp; dated October 10, 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp; Citing&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 7, Rule&nbsp; Ill of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Criminal Procedure,&nbsp; it&nbsp; asseverates&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; no&nbsp; prejudicial&nbsp; question&nbsp; involved which would justify the suspension of the criminal&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; against the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OSP contends that by filing a motion to quash, petitioner hypothetically admits the facts alleged in the Informations and that the Sandiganbayan&nbsp; did not gravely abused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion to quash.&nbsp; It additionally alleged that the denial of a motion to quash is not correctible by certiorari.<br><br>In&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp;&nbsp; separate&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; PCGG&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; BASECO&nbsp;&nbsp; alleged essentially the same arguments in asserting that petitioner is a public officer. It was asserted in their respective Comments that BASECO's income, as a sequestered&nbsp; corporation, are remitted to the PCGG and then turned-over&nbsp; to the Bureau of Treasury.&nbsp; The members of the board of directors of BASECO were elected&nbsp; by virtue&nbsp; of "Desire&nbsp; Letters"&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of the Republic of the Philippines and that petitioner sat as President and Director of BASECO by virtue of the appointing power of the President.&nbsp; As such, he handled&nbsp; the&nbsp; affairs&nbsp; of&nbsp; BASECO&nbsp; in&nbsp; representation&nbsp; and&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the interests of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, petitioner is a public officer exercising functions for public benefit, namely, management of sequestered corporation and earning income for the government.<br><br>The Petition is not impressed with merit.<br><br>In law, nothing is as elementary as the concept of jurisdiction, for the same is the foundation upon which the courts exercise their power of adjudication, and without which, no rights or obligation could emanate from any&nbsp; decision&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; defined&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; power&nbsp; and authority of a court to hear, try and decide a case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan&nbsp; is&nbsp; provided&nbsp; in&nbsp; P.D.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1606,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended&nbsp; by&nbsp; R.A.&nbsp; No. 10660, which, insofar as relevant in this case, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;<i> Jurisdiction. </i>The&nbsp; Sandiganbayan&nbsp; shall&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; original jurisdiction in all cases involving:<br><blockquote>a. Violations&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; Anti-Graft&nbsp; and&nbsp; Corrupt&nbsp; Practices&nbsp; Act, Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1379,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Chapter&nbsp; II,&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; Title&nbsp; VII&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the principal accused are&nbsp; officials&nbsp; occupying&nbsp; the&nbsp; following&nbsp; positions&nbsp; in&nbsp; the government,&nbsp; whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:<br></blockquote><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Officials&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; executive&nbsp;&nbsp; branch&nbsp;&nbsp; occupying&nbsp;&nbsp; the positions&nbsp; of regional&nbsp; director&nbsp; and higher,&nbsp; otherwise classified as grade 27 and higher, of the Compensation&nbsp; and Position&nbsp; Classification&nbsp; Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1989&nbsp; (Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 6758), specifically including:<br><br>xxxx<br></blockquote><blockquote>(g) Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; controlled&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations;<br></blockquote>, b.&nbsp; Other&nbsp; offenses&nbsp; or&nbsp; felonies&nbsp; whether&nbsp; simple&nbsp; or&nbsp; complexed with&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; crimes&nbsp;&nbsp; committed&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp;&nbsp; officials&nbsp;&nbsp; and employees&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; subsection&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; section&nbsp; in relation to their office."</blockquote>In&nbsp; this&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Informations&nbsp; filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner before the Sandiganbayan&nbsp; showed&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; charged&nbsp; with Violation&nbsp; of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, and Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Document.&nbsp; The Information for violation of the anti­ graft&nbsp; law&nbsp; asserts&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner, <i> "in&nbsp; the&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; administrative and/or official&nbsp; functions&nbsp; and taking advantage&nbsp; of his official position, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally, with evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence" performed the acts constitutive of the offense charged.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; charge&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; complex&nbsp;&nbsp; crime&nbsp;&nbsp; of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Document was allegedly&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; petitioner "while&nbsp; in the performance&nbsp; of or in relation to his office and taking advantage of his official position." </i>&nbsp; Both Informations&nbsp; also alleged that petitioner is a public officer "being&nbsp; then the President and a member of the Board of Directors of the Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Co., Inc. (BASECO), a government-owned or -controlled corporation. "&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; accusatory Informations alone, there is sufficient basis for the Sandiganbayan to take cognizance of the two (2) cases against the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurisdiction of a court over a criminal case is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information.&nbsp; And once if it shown, the court may validly take cognizance of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's defense that he was not a public officer at the time of the alleged&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of the offense does not hold water.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well-settled that,&nbsp; "jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; affected&nbsp; by the&nbsp; pleas&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; theories&nbsp; set&nbsp; up&nbsp; by defendant or respondent&nbsp; in an answer, a motion to dismiss, or a motion to quash.&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; would&nbsp; become&nbsp; dependent&nbsp; almost&nbsp; entirely upon the whims of defendant or respondent." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Besides, his admission in his Counter-Affidavit filed before the Office of the Ombudsman that he was appointed as member of the Board of Directors, and eventually as President of&nbsp; BASECO&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; former&nbsp;&nbsp; President&nbsp;&nbsp; Gloria&nbsp;&nbsp; Macapagal-Arroyo,&nbsp; militates against his claim that he was not a public officer.&nbsp; A public officer is defined in the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code as "any&nbsp; person who, by direct provision&nbsp; of the law, popular election, or appointment by competent authority, shall take part in the performance&nbsp; of public functions in the Government&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; or&nbsp; shall&nbsp; perform&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; or&nbsp; in&nbsp; any&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; branches, public duties as an employee, agent or subordinate official, of any rank or class."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; concept&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; public&nbsp; officer&nbsp; was&nbsp; expounded&nbsp; further&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Serana&nbsp; case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> where it was held that, "An&nbsp; investment&nbsp; in an individual of some portion of the sovereign functions of the governmeni,&nbsp; to be exercised by&nbsp; him&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; makes&nbsp; one&nbsp; a&nbsp; public&nbsp; officer."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As President of a sequestered company like BASECO, petitioner is expected to perform functions that would benefit the public in general.<br><br>Thus, the Sandiganbayan&nbsp; did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's Motion to Quash and Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; It definitely has jurisdiction over the case and over the person of the petitioner since offenses for violation of R.A. No. 3019 and the complex crime of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Document and petitioner's&nbsp;&nbsp; position,&nbsp; as&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Informations,&nbsp; are&nbsp; clearly among those offenses&nbsp; and felonies and public officers&nbsp; enumerated&nbsp; in P.D.
