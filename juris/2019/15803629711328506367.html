On the other hand, Lean Noel Dizon @ <i>Jingle </i>and Shiela Mae Dizon testified for the defense.<br><br><u><center>The Prosecution's Version</center></u><br>Sometime in late November 2010, Task Force <i>Kasaligan</i> (TFK) of Negros Oriental received information about the nefarious activities of a certain <i>Jingle</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> According to TFK's informant, <i>Jingle</i> had a reputation of peddling illegal drugs in Barangay Dos, Siaton, Negros Oriental and was expected to sell illegal drugs during the forthcoming town fiesta.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In the late afternoon of December 4, 2010, a buy bust team was formed consisting of PDEA Special Investigator 1 Claire Oledan, PDEA Information Officer 1 Julieta Amatong, NBI Special Agent Miguel Dungog, Police Officer 3 Jerry Magsayo, Police Officer 3 Ramon Bernard Pedeglorio, and Police Officer 2 Glenn Corsame. The team immediately held a briefing at the house of Agent Dungog in Siaton, Negros Oriental. There, Agent Dungog was designated as team leader, Agent Oledan as poseur-buyer, PO3 Magsayo and PO3 Pedeglorio as immediate back up, and the rest of the team as perimeter security. They marked the buy bust money of P500.00 bill with serial number CG519652 "TFK" or Task Force <i>Kasaligan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Around 9 o'clock the following morning, December 5, 2010, Agent Oledan and the informant went to the place where <i>Jingle</i> lived. Agent Oledan positioned herself outside the gate of the residence of Jingle while the informant went inside. After a while, Agent Oledan saw the informant and <i>Jingle</i> coming out from the house. <i>Jingle</i> walked up to her and asked for the payment. She immediately handed the marked P500.00 bill to <i>Jingle</i> which the latter slid in his pocket. Jingle showed her two (2) sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i>, lying on his palm. He asked Agent Oledan to choose one sachet. Jingle readily handed her the sachet she chose, Agent Oledan slid it in her pocket and discreetly dialled the number of PO3 Magsayo to signal the consummated sale.<br><br>As soon as they heard the ringtone, PO3 Magsayo and PO3 Pedeglorio immediately closed in and pursued <i>Jingle</i> who ran toward his house. Jingle eventually got arrested. Agent Oledan recovered another sachet of <i>shabu </i>from <i>Jingle</i> when the latter tried to wiggle away from PO3 Pedeglorio and PO3 Magsayo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> PO3 Pedeglorio arrested Jingle and informed him of his constitutional rights. PO3 Magsayo also frisked him and retrieved from his pocket the marked P500 bill and two (2) other P500 bills.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>PO3 Pedeglorio marked the seized items in the makeshift nipa hut right outside <i>Jingle</i>'s house. He also initiated a partial inventory of the items. The marking and partial inventory were done in the presence of <i>Jingle</i>, two (2) Barangay Dos officials namely: Kagawad Reynaldo Sumagaysay and Santiago Saberon, Jr., and DOJ reperesentative Nicanor Ernesto Tagle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Agent Amatong took photographs of the seized items during the inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The buy bust team then took "<i>Jingle</i>" to the Dumaguete NBI Office where his arrest was entered in the blotter. <i>Jingle</i> identified himself as Lean Noel Dizon (appellant).<br><br>Meantime, PO3 Pedeglorio resumed the inventory at the NBI Office and asked media representative Neil Rio to sign it. PO3 Pedeglorio further prepared the request for the laboratory examination of the seized items. Agent Oledan signed for the requesting party.

The driver asked appellant where they could find Mark Badon. Appellant replied he did not know the person. As he turned to walk back into the house, the driver and another man rushed toward him, held his hands, and elbowed him. As a result, he fell on the ground. When he and his sister asked what was wrong, the men introduced themselves as police officers. They instructed him and his sister not to ask questions. They handcuffed and brought him to the makeshift nipa hut.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>There, PO3 Pedeglorio pulled out from his pocket two (2) sachets of <i>shabu</i> and a piece of paper. The officers warned appellant and his sister that the evidence will be used against appellant if he refused to help them. The officers then called for barangay officials and others to join them. Meantime, appellant was made to sign the piece of paper. The police officers placed money over the piece of paper beside the two (2) sachets of <i>shabu</i>. When the barangay officials, the Mayor of Siaton, Agent Dungog and his two (2) female companions arrived, they affixed their signatures to the piece of paper. While signing it, their photographs were taken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the police officers boarded appellant into the vehicle and took him to the Dumaguete NBI office. Inside the vehicle, PO3 Pedeglorio asked appellant if he would like to become their asset and buy <i>shabu</i> from a certain Brian. They assured him that if he agreed, they will no longer bring him to Dumaguete. But appellant did not agree. They then took him to the house of Agent Dungog, where he was made to eat breakfast. Agent Dungog repeated his offer which appellant again refused. Consequently, Agent Dungog instructed the team to bring him to Dumaguete.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The team took him first to the Dumaguete NBI office, then, to the police station where his urine samples were collected. By that time, he already knew the identities of the arresting agents. Around two (2) weeks earlier, Agent Dungog already offered to utilize him as police asset. He did not file a case against the police because he did not have money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The defense did not offer any documentary evidence.<br><br><u><center>The Trial Court's Ruling</center></u><br>By Joint Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated August 23, 2013, the trial court found appellant guilty of both cases, viz:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment as follows:<br><ol>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<li> In Criminal Case No. 20259, the accused Lean Noel Dizon @ "Jingle" is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal sale of 0.15 gram of <i>shabu</i> in violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and is hereby sentenced to suffer a penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>The one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet with markings "LND-BB 12-05-2010" containing 0.15 gram of <i>shabu </i>is hereby confiscated and forfeited in favor of the government and to be disposed of in accordance with law.<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. 20260, the accused Lean Noel Dizon @ "Jingle" is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of 0.13 gram of <i>shabu</i> in violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A.

It found that the prosecution had adequately and satisfactorily proved the elements of illegal sale of shabu and illegal possession of shabu. It also found that the chain of custody of the seized items was not broken. There was proof of the continuous whereabouts of the exhibits from the time it came into possession of the arresting officers, until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it was offered in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><u><center>The Present Appeal</center></u><br>Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and pleads anew for his acquittal. In compliance with Resolution dated December 7, 2016, the OSG manifested that, in lieu of supplemental brief, it was adopting its appellee's brief before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As for appellant, he failed to file his supplemental brief within the thirty (30) day period granted for the purpose, hence, the Court deemed that in lieu of supplemental and appeal brief, he too, was adopting its appeal brief before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><u><center>Issues<br></center></u><br><blockquote><u>First</u>. Was appellant's warrantless arrest, including the incidental search of his person valid?<br><br><u>Second</u>. Is the informant's testimony indispensable to a successful prosecution for illegal sale of drugs?<br><br><u>Third</u>. Was Agent Tagle who witnessed the inventory, a member of the buy bust team, hence, considered a biased witness?<br><br><u>Fourth</u>. Was the chain of custody rule complied with?<br></blockquote><br><u><center>Ruling</center></u><br><b><i>Appellant's warrantless arrest<br>including the incidental search<br>was valid.</i></b><br><br>Appellant first assails his warrantless arrest including the incidental search made on his person. On this score, Section 5 of Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5 <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful</i> - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>xxxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxxx</blockquote>Appellant was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu </i>during a buy bust operation. <b>People v. Rivera</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> reiterated the rule that warrantless arrest made during an entrapment operation including the search done incidental thereto was valid pursuant to Section 5(a) of Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure.<br><br>A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment which in recent years has been accepted as a valid and effective mode of apprehending drug pushers. In a buy-bust operation, the idea to commit a crime originates from the offender, without anyone inducing or prodding him to commit the offense. If carried out with due regard for constitutional and legal safeguards, a buy-bust operation deserves judicial sanction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> So must it be.<br><br><b><i>The testimony of the informant is not<br>necessary to a successful prosecution<br>for illegal sale of dangerous drugs.</i></b><br><br>Appellant further asserts that for not presenting the informant's testimony, the prosecution may not be deemed to have proved his guilt of the offense charged.<br><br>The argument must fail. In <b>People v. Tripoli</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court found that the informant in that case was not presented in court for security reasons, as there was a compelling need to protect the informant from possible retaliation of the accused who got arrested through the informant's efforts. The informant's identity should be kept in confidence in deference to his invaluable service to law enforcement. Only when the testimony of the informant is considered absolutely essential in obtaining the conviction of the accused should the need to protect his security be disregarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The prosecution here did not find the need to expose the informant's identity for the purpose of proving the case of the People.<br><br><b><i>There was no proof that DOJ<br>representative Agent Tagle<br>was a member of the buy bust<br>team.</i></b><br><br>As for the alleged bias of DOJ representative Agent Tagle who witnessed the inventory of the seized items, appellant's bare allegation that the former was a member of the buy bust team, hence, should be deemed a biased witness is devoid of probative weight. A bare allegation is not evidence.<br><br><i><b>The Court may review the<br>arresting team's compliance with<br>the chain of custody rule although<br>appellant has not raised it here as<br>an issue.</b></i><br><br>The Court now reckons with the core issue in every indictment for illegal sale or possession of dangerous drugs: Was the chain of custody rule duly complied with? Indeed, compliance with the chain of custody rule determines the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> and ultimately, the fate of appellant's liberty. Although appellant himself has not raised this issue here or even below, the Court is not deterred from taking cognizance thereof. The Court can even examine the case records if only to ascertain whether the procedure had been completely complied with, and if not, whether good reasons exist to excuse any deviation therefrom. This conforms with the rule that appeal in a criminal case throws the entire case open for review.<br><br>In illegal drugs cases, the drug itself constitutes the corpus <i>delicti</i> of the offense. The prosecution is, therefore, tasked to establish that the substance illegally possessed or sold by the accused is the same substance presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>To ensure the integrity of the seized drugs, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <i><b>first</b></i>, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i><b>second</b></i>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i><b>third</b></i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>This is the chain of custody rule. It emerged as a potent safeguard against any possible tampering, alteration, or substitution either by accident or otherwise the usually indistinct and not readily identifiable form of illegal drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Information here alleged that appellant committed the offenses on December 5, 2010. The applicable law, therefore, is RA 9165 before its amendment under RA 10640.<br><br>Section 21 of RA 9165 bears the prescribed procedure in preserving the <i>corpus delicti </i>in illegal drugs cases, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>SEC. 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>1.

One (1) required witness though was missing: a representative from media. Absence of one of the required witnesses is already a breach of the chain of custody rule.<br><br>In <b>People v. Seguiente</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court acquitted the accused because the prosecution's evidence was bereft of any showing that a representative from the DOJ was present during the inventory and photograph. The Court keenly noted, as in this case, that the prosecution failed to recognize this particular deficiency. The Court, thus, concluded that this lapse, among others, effectively produced serious doubts on the integrity and identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> especially in the face of allegations of frame up.<br><br>Although PO3 Pedeglorio testified that media representative Neil Rio came later to the NBI Dumaguete Office and affixed his signature to the inventory, the same, however, did not cure the incipient breach. He was not mentioned as one of those present at the place of arrest who actually witnessed the inventory. In <i><b>People vs. Acabo</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court acquitted the accused because there was a deviation from the witness requirement as the conduct of the inventory and photograph was not witnessed by the DOJ while the media representative merely signed the certificate of inventory but did not actually witness the inventory and photograph of the seized items. The Court reiterated that the law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily to ensure that the chain of custody has been duly established, and thus remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence.<br><br>We have clarified, that a perfect chain may be impossible to obtain at all times because of varying field conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 offers a saving clause allowing leniency whenever justifiable grounds exist which warrant deviation from established protocol so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The prosecution, however, offered no explanation why media representative Rio did not witness the first part or the second part of the inventory. He was only asked to affix his signature to the inventory itself. In fine, the condition for the saving clause to become operational was not complied with. For the same reason, the provison "so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved", will not come into play. <i><b>People vs. Año</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> is instructive:<br><blockquote>The Court, however, clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA9165 may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In fact, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 - which is now crystallized into statutory law with the passage of RA 1064030- provide that non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 - under justifiable grounds - will not automatically render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In other words, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR does not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; <u>and</u> (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <i>People v. Almorfe</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <u>the Court explained that for the above-saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved.</u> Also, in <i>People v. De Guzman</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> it was emphasized that <u>the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.</u></blockquote><br>As heretofore shown, the chain of custody here had been seriously violated. We cannot therefore consider the identity and integrity of the seized drug items to have been preserved. Hence, appellant must be acquitted as a matter of right.<br><br><i>Finally</i>, prosecution witness Agent Oledan confirmed that appellant signed the Certificate of Inventory of the seized items. There was no showing, however, that appellant was even notified of his right to counsel or the right not at all to sign the Certificate of Inventory, thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="center">Q </div></td> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="center">:</div></td> <td width="90%" valign="top"> <div align="left">Madam Witness, in the Certification of Inventory, I am just curious of a signature on a blank, (sic) the space provided for counsel/representative of accused, since you said that you were there, whose signature is this, Madam Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="center">:</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="left">I cannot recall the person who signed for the blank portion, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="center">: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="left">You also said, Madam Witness, that in the Certificate of Inventory, you also said that the accused signed the Certificate of Inventory, am I correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="center">: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="center">: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="left">And this is the signature of the accused, am&nbsp; I correct? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="center">: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Yes, the received (sic) copy marked as Exhibit "E-8".</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q : </div></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="left">The one who wrote the received copy is not the accused but a member of your arresting team, am I correct? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="center">:</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="left">I cannot recall, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote><b>People v. Del Castillo</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> is apropos, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The Inventory Receipt signed by appellant is thus not only inadmissible for being violative of appellant's custodial right to remain silent; it is also an <i>indicium</i> of the irregularity in the manner by which the raiding team conducted the search of appellant's residence.<br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that appellant did waive her right to counsel, such waiver must be voluntary, knowing and intelligent. To insure that a waiver is voluntary and intelligent, the Constitution, requires that for the right to counsel to be waived, the waiver must be in writing and in the presence of the counsel of the accused. There is no such written waiver in this case, much less was any waiver made in the presence of the counsel since there was no counsel at the time appellant signed the receipt. Clearly, appellant affixed her signature in the inventory receipt without the assistance of counsel which is a violation of her right under the <u>Constitution</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote>Here, appellant was not apprised of his right to counsel nor his right not to sign at all the certificate of inventory of the seized items. Neither was he shown that to have waived his right to counsel in writing. On the strength of <i><b>Del Castillo</b></i> vis-a-vis the flagrant violation of appellant's right to counsel, appellant should be acquitted.<br><br>For perspective, in cases involving illegal possession of dangerous drug, even for the most miniscule amount, imprisonment of at least twelve years and one day awaits violators. It is thus of utmost importance that the safeguards against abuses of power in the conduct of drug-related arrests be strictly implemented. The purpose is to eradicate wrongful arrests and, worse, convictions. The pernicious practice of switching, planting or contamination of the corpus delicti under the regime of RA 6425, otherwise known as the "Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972," could again be resurrected if the lawful requirements were otherwise lightly brushed aside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
