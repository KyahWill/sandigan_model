CV No. 109683 affirming the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 dated January 11, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo City, 
Branch 72 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 12-9628, which declared the marriage 
of petitioner Juanita E. Cahapisan-Santiago (petitioner) and respondent 
James Paul A. Santiago (respondent) null and void on the ground of the 
latter's psychological incapacity.
  <p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b>
  </p><p>Sometime in 1999, respondent met petitioner at a car service 
center along Marcos Highway, Antipolo City. At that time, petitioner was
 forty (40) years old and respondent was twenty-two (22) years old.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 Petitioner became respondent's girlfriend, and three (3) months into 
the relationship, she became pregnant. Eventually, or on March 31, 2000,
 petitioner and respondent got married before the Mayor of Pangil, 
Laguna. During their marriage, however, instead of experiencing marital 
bliss, their relationship was fraught with quarrels.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  
  </p><p> Respondent averred that petitioner was domineering, 
considering that she was the one earning and he was a high school 
drop-out. Sometime in 2005, petitioner and respondent separated because 
they could no longer stand each other. After eleven (11) years of living
 apart, respondent filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of 
Marriage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> before the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In support of his petition, respondent presented the report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 of an expert clinical psychologist, Ms. Shiela Marie O. Montefalcon 
(Ms. Montefalcon), who assessed him to be suffering from Dependent 
Personality Disorder (DPD),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and petitioner from Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 According to the report, respondent's DPD is a long term chronic 
condition that manifested itself through his overdependence on 
petitioner and his own mother to meet his emotional and physical needs. 
The clinical features of respondent's DPD were likewise exhibited 
through his: (<em>a</em>) difficulty in making everyday decisions 
without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from petitioner 
and his own mother; (<em>b</em>) problem in expressing disagreement with others because of fear or loss of support or approval; (<em>c</em>) struggle in initiating projects on his own because of lack of self-confidence in judgment or abilities; (<em>d</em>) excessive dependence on petitioner and his own mother to obtain nurturance and support; and (<em>e</em>) inclination to substance use and abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 On the other hand, petitioner's NPD was found to be grave, severe, and 
already ingrained deeply within her adaptive system, as evidenced by her
 pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of 
empathy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As both parties 
were found to be psychologically incapacitated to perform their 
essential marital obligations, Ms. Montefalcon, therefore, recommended 
that their marriage be declared null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  </p><p> For her part, petitioner contended that respondent was not 
psychologically incapacitated, but was merely immature and lacked a 
sense of responsibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
She also pointed out that respondent's past addictive behavior is not 
permanent, considering that the latter was able to cope with his drug 
dependency and was able to change for the better.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 She added that respondent's alleged DPD is even contrary to his 
personality, since the report stated that respondent "can present a 
proposal or lead a group discussion with ease and tact. He is assertive 
but sometimes impatient. He is best in situations that need sound common
 sense and practical ability with things. He relies on his ability to 
improvise instead of preparing in advance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 Furthermore, respondent's 	"common capacities and strengths" are "being
 friendly, energetic, resourceful, and having negotiating skills."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Finally, she claimed that it was respondent's womanizing, and not his purported dependency, that caused their frequent fights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC Ruling</b>  
  </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
dated January 11, 2017, the RTC granted the petition and declared the 
marriage of the parties null and void on the ground of respondent's 
psychological incapacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> 
The RTC ruled that the totality of evidence sufficiently established 
respondent's incapacity to fulfill his marital obligations, as he was 
shown to have disregarded and abandoned his family after repeated 
quarrels with petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Moreover, having been diagnosed with DPD, respondent manifested his inability to be cognizant of his familial obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>However,
 as to petitioner's alleged psychological incapacity, the RTC held that 
there was insufficient evidence to prove its root cause or juridical 
antecedence</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
  </p><p> Aggrieved, petitioner filed an appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> before the CA.
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b>  
  </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated June 6, 2018, the CA affirmed the RTC Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 The CA ruled that respondent was able to discharge his burden of 
proving that his marriage with petitioner was void due to his 
psychological incapacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In this regard, it found that the root cause of respondent's psychological incapacity,<em> i.e.</em>,
 DPD, was medically identified, and that the same was present at the 
inception of his marriage with petitioner, considering that prior to the
 marriage, he was already irresponsible, drug dependent, and 
overdependent on his mother.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It also found that respondent's DPD was permanent, incurable, and grave, as a result of his upbringing and family background. 
  </p><p> Dissatisfied, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated August 1, 2018; hence, this petition.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the Court</b> 
  </p><p>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the 
parties' marriage should be nullified on the ground of respondent's 
psychological incapacity, <em>i.e</em>., DPD.
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b>  
  </p><p> The petition is meritorious. At the outset, it bears stressing
 that the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, already ruled that there was 
insufficient evidence to prove the root cause or juridical antecedence 
of petitioner's alleged NPD. Finding no cogent reason to disturb the 
same, the resolution of this case shall, thus, revolve on whether or 
not, on the other hand, respondent's psychological incapacity, <i>i.e</i>., DPD, was proven.  
  </p><p> Jurisprudence states that the validity of marriage and the 
unity of the family are enshrined in our Constitution and statutory 
laws; hence, any doubts attending the same are to be resolved in favor 
of the continuance and validity of the marriage and that the burden of 
proving the nullity of the same rests at all times upon the petitioner. 
The policy of the Constitution is to protect and strengthen the family 
as the basic social institution and marriage as the foundation of the 
family. As such, the Constitution decrees marriage as legally inviolable
 and protects it from dissolution at the whim of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Under Article 36<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the Family Code, as amended,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
 psychological incapacity is a valid ground to nullify a marriage. 
However, in deference to the State's policy on marriage, psychological 
incapacity does not merely pertain to any psychological condition; 
otherwise, it would be fairly easy to circumvent our laws on marriage so
 much so that we would be practically condoning a legal subterfuge for 
divorce.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> 
  </p><p> According to case law, psychological incapacity should be confined to the <b><u>most
 serious cases of personality disorders that clearly manifest utter 
insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the 
marriage</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It should refer to no less than a mental — not merely physical — incapacity that causes a party to be <b><u>truly
 incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be 
assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage</u></b>, which, as provided under Article 68<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Family Code, among others,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> include their mutual obligations to live together, observe love, respect and fidelity, and render help and support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
  </p><p> In this accord, psychological incapacity must therefore be characterized by three (3) traits: (<em>a</em>) gravity,<em> i.e.</em>,
 it must be grave and serious such that the party would be incapable of 
carrying out the ordinary duties required in a marriage; (<em>b</em>) juridical antecedence, <em>i.e.</em>,
 it must be rooted in the history of the party antedating the marriage, 
although the overt manifestations may emerge only after the marriage; 
and (<em>c</em>) incurability, <em>i.e.</em>, it must be incurable, or even if it were otherwise, the cure would be beyond the means of the party involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
  </p><p> Applying the foregoing guidelines, the Court finds that - contrary to the rulings of the courts <i>a quo</i> - the totality of evidence presented failed to sufficiently establish respondent's psychological incapacity based on his DPD.</p><p>
 In this case, respondent relied heavily on the testimony of and 
psychological examination by the clinical psychologist, Ms. Montefalcon,
 to establish his psychological incapacity. In her report, she 
enumerated several clinical features indicative of respondent's DPD, to 
wit: (<em>a</em>) difficulty in making everyday decisions without an 
excessive amount of advice and reassurance from petitioner and his own 
mother; (<em>b</em>) problem in expressing disagreement with others because of fear or loss of support or approval; (<em>c</em>) struggle in initiating projects on his own because of lack of self-confidence in judgment or abilities; (<em>d</em>) excessive dependence on petitioner and his own mother to obtain nurturance and support; and (<em>e</em>) inclination to substance use and abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 However, the report leaves much to be desired as it did not even 
identify specific actions or incidents that could amply demonstrate his 
alleged psychological incapacity. As the petitioner aptly points out, 
"[i]n the [p]sychological [r]eport, there is nothing in [respondent's] 
acts that is indicative of his 'chronic condition in which he depends 
too much on others to meet his emotional and physical needs.' In fact, 
the report failed to show 'who' are those other that [respondent] 
depended [on] too much x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
 Also, as petitioner emphasizes, respondent's alleged DPD appears to be 
even contrary to his personality since the report actually states, among
 others, that respondent's	"common capacities and strengths" are "being 
friendly, energetic, resourceful, and having negotiating skills."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 Moreover, the report states that respondent "is best in situations that
 need sound common sense and practical ability with things [as] he 
relies on his ability to improvise instead of preparing in advance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
  </p><p> More importantly, the link between respondent's acts to his 
alleged psychological incapacity was not established. Even if it is 
assumed that respondent truly had difficulties in making everyday 
decisions without excessive advice or reassurance coming from other 
people, such as petitioner and his own mother, the report fails to prove
 that the said difficulties were tantamount to serious psychological 
disorder that would render him incapable of performing the essential 
marital obligations. As case law holds, "<b>[i]n determining the existence of psychological incapacity, <u>a
 clear and understandable causation between the party's condition and 
the party's inability to perform the essential marital covenants must be
 shown</u>. A psychological report that is essentially comprised of mere
 platitudes, however speckled with technical jargon, would not cut the 
marriage tie</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> 
Similarly, Ms. Montefalcon's report merely provided general 
characterizations of the parties' illnesses as deeply-rooted, grave, and
 incurable. In her report, she stated that the root cause of the 
parties' flawed personality patterns was attributable to genetic factors
 and/or dysfunctional factors involved in their childhood milieu. She 
also declared that their illnesses were grave, since the parties were 
not able to carry out the normal and ordinary duties of marriage and 
family, and incurable, as they have no psychological insight that they 
have character problems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> 
However, no evidence was presented to substantiate these conclusions. In
 fact, as petitioner demonstrates, the report seems to contradict the 
foregoing characterizations since it was observed that respondent "was 
awaken and decided x x x to fix his life" and that "[h]e admitted that 
he is weak but he was able to resist drugs and [is now] helping his 
mother run their business."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> As such, it cannot be concluded that respondent's DPD is imbued with the required quality of permanence or incurability.</p><p>
 If anything, Ms. Montefalcon's evaluation only supports the allegations
 regarding respondent's infidelity, immaturity, and dependence on his 
mother and wife, which traits do not, however, rise to the level of the 
psychological incapacity that would justify the nullification of the 
parties' marriage. Indeed, while respondent's purported womanizing 
caused the couple's frequent fights, such was not established to be 
caused by a psychological illness. In fact, records reveal that when 
petitioner discovered respondent's affair for the first time, the latter
 immediately severed it. They would also eventually reconcile and live 
together after their fights. Thus, respondent's infidelity does not 
appear to be a symptom of a grave and permanent psychological disorder 
that renders him incapable of performing his spousal obligations. In a 
long line of cases, the Court has held that sexual infidelity, by 
itself, is not sufficient proof that petitioner is suffering from 
psychological incapacity. It must be shown that the acts of 
unfaithfulness are manifestations of a disordered personality which make
 the spouse completely unable to discharge the essential obligations of 
marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p> In fine, 
for failing to sufficiently prove the existence of respondent's 
psychological incapacity within the contemplation of Article 36 of the 
Family Code, the petition is granted. The contrary rulings of the courts
 <em>a quo</em> are hence, reversed and set aside.
