Evangelista, Mark Ryan Q. Evangelista, Domingo Evangelista, SPO1 Ricardo De Vera, PO1 Tristan Fernandez, Rolando Quinto, Dra. Gladiola Manaois, and Dr. Cipriano Fernandez, testified for the prosecution. On the other hand, appellant alone testified for the defense.<br><br><i>Version of the Prosecution</i><br><br>On April 27, 2010, around 11:30 in the evening, Eric and Mark Ryan Evangelista were inside their residence in Barangay Gayaman, Binmaley, Pangasinan, celebrating the eve of their sister's wedding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> While the celebration was ongoing, they suddenly heard a loud noise coming from the engine and muffler of a tricycle. Eric and their youngest brother Elmer stepped out of the house to check what the loud noise was all about. Mark Ryan followed them shortly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Sonny "Jong" Baynosa occupied the driver's seat of the nearby parked tricycle where the noise was coming from. He was in the company of appellant, James "Chita" Santos, and Dennis Ramos. As brothers Eric and Elmer approached, appellant alighted from the tricycle, walked straight to and forcefully stabbed Elmer in the right abdomen. The knife snapped.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>When Eric rushed to help Elmer, Baynosa stabbed him (Eric) in the back, just below his right shoulder. Mark Ryan who followed his brothers was not spared. Santos stabbed him, too, in his right waist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Abelardo rushed to his brothers' aid. But Ramos also stabbed him in the left stomach. Santos himself turned to Abelardo and stabbed the latter in the right abdomen. Not to be outdone, appellant grabbed an icepick and joined in. He stabbed Abelardo in the left chest. Baynosa also pulled an icepick and stabbed Abelardo in the right chest. In view of the multiple stab wounds he sustained, Abelardo fell to the ground. But still not satisfied, Santos stabbed him again in the back. Thereafter, appellant walked away while Baynosa, Ramos, and Santos fled on board the tricycle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>A cousin of the Evangelista brothers, Rolando Quinto, saw the incident but he was too scared to help.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Only after the assailants had left did Rolando and others approach and rush Elmer, Eric, Mark Ryan, and Abelardo to the hospital.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Abelardo was pronounced dead on arrival.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Elmer died in the hospital.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Dr. Cipriano C. Fernandez treated Eric and Mark Ryan. As for Eric, Dr. Fernandez found a stab wound in his back though it was not fatal. Dr. Fernandez opined that even without adequate medical attendance, the wound would heal in seven (7) to ten (10) days. Eric got discharged from the hospital on the following day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>As for Mark Ryan, he sustained a stab wound in the waist (back). He had to be admitted into the Intensive Care Unit. After twelve (12) hours, however, his condition worsened. Wasting no time, Dr. Fernandez immediately did an operation on Mark Ryan. When Dr. Fernandez opened up Mark Ryan, the latter's abdomen was filled with blood flowing from his punctured liver. It was a fatal injury which could have caused Mark Ryan's death were it not for the timely and adequate medical attendance given him. It would take him up to three (3) months to recover from this injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Ricardo de Vera and PO1 Tristan B. Fernandez were among the police officers who responded to the reported stabbing incident. When SPO1 de Vera arrived at the <i>locus criminis, </i>the victims had already been brought to the hospital. The victims' father, Domingo Evangelista, identified appellant as one of the assailants. SPO1 De Vera and the other police officers were able to apprehend appellant. After apprising him of his constitutional rights, they took appellant to the Lingayen Community Hospital for medical examination.

Marlon was Domingo's nephew. Around 11:45 in the evening, he was outside Domingo's house when Baynosa arrived on board his tricycle. Baynosa was in the company of Santos and Ramos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Eric and Mark Ryan stepped out from the house and called out Baynosa for the loud noise coming from the tricycle. Santos and Ramos alighted from the tricycle and asked the Evangelista brothers to stop shouting to avoid further trouble. But Eric yelled even louder at Baynosa while Mark Ryan cursed Baynosa and his companions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Then together, Eric and Mark Ryan walked up to the group and repeatedly punched Ramos.

Their testimonies were consistent on material points, more particularly, on how each of the victims was stabbed by appellant and his co-accused. The trial court held that the credible and positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses necessarily prevail over appellant's denial.<br><br>The trial court further held that the qualifying circumstance of treachery attended the commission of the crime because the perpetrators, including appellant, suddenly stabbed the unarmed victims without any warning, thus, totally depriving the victims of the opportunity to defend themselves.<br><br>Finally, the trial court found appellant to have acted in conspiracy with his co-accused Santos, Ramos, and Baynosa. As established by the evidence on record, these persons acted in such synchronized and coordinated manner indicating unity of purpose and design.<br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals</b></center><br><br>On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for finding him guilty as charged in all three (3) cases. We sum up below appellant's assigned errors, <i>viz</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>(1) The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were incredible, illogical, and grossly inconsistent with human experience. At the time of the incident, there was an ongoing party attended by relatives and friends of the Evangelista family. It was, therefore, unthinkable, if not preposterous for the Evangelista brothers not to have asked help from the people around who supposedly witnessed the crimes. Even if some of these people may have been, out of fear, hesitant to help them, it was utterly against human experience that even their relatives, other than their immediate family, remained apathetic at such crucial time when their loved ones were being butchered. It even took their relatives an hour to report the incident to the police.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>(2) Eric admittedly had a grudge against him (and vice versa), yet, during the alleged incident, he purportedly attacked Elmer first, not Eric against whom he supposedly had a grudge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>(3) The trial court should not have readily accepted the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who, being the relatives of the victims, were not deemed disinterested witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>(4) The testimonies of witnesses who themselves were aggrieved by the death of their relatives should have been handled with the realistic thought that these witnesses had material and emotional ties with the cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>(5) Although generally weak, denial gains commensurate strength when the credibility of the prosecution witnesses is wanting and questionable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>(6) It was Domingo, the victims' father, who implicated him as the assailant, albeit, Domingo himself did not actually witness the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>(7) Even assuming he was liable for Abelardo's death, he should not be made similarly liable for the injuries sustained by Eric and Mark Ryan. The prosecution miserably failed to prove that he, Baynosa, Ramos, and Santos conspired to commit the crimes charged. His mere presence at the <i>locus criminis </i>did not mean he agreed to assault the Evangelista brothers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>(8) Granting, without conceding that he was liable for the death of Abelardo and the injuries of Eric and Mark Ryan, still, he cannot be held liable for murder, frustrated murder, and attempted murder. At most, he may only be held liable for homicide, frustrated homicide, and attempted homicide because the qualifying circumstance of treachery was absent in these cases. Both Eric and Mark Ryan knew he (appellant) had a bad reputation in the community. Thus, when Eric and Mark Ryan approached him and his group, these two (2) were already deemed forewarned of the impending danger to their lives. Hence, the attack on the Evangelista brothers cannot be considered to be sudden, unexpected, or unforeseen. There can be no treachery when the victim was aware of the impending or actual danger to his life.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, through Assistant Solicitor General Herman R. Cimafranca and State Solicitor Cheryl Angeline M. Roque, essentially countered:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>(a) The trial court's factual findings are entitled to great weight and should not be disturbed on appeal unless certain facts of substance and value were overlooked or misappreciated, which, if correctly considered, may have altered the outcome of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>(b) Relationship <i>per se </i>does not affect the credibility of these witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>(c) As between the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the negative statements of appellant, the former deserve more credence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>(d) The trial court correctly appreciated the attendance of treachery as qualifying circumstance. Assuming the Evangelista brothers were forewarned of the impending danger to their lives that could have possibly come from appellant, they were not aware that at the time of the incident Angeles and his group had actually intended to kill them. The sudden and unexpected attack launched by appellant and his group on the Evangelista brothers completely rendered these men unable to defend themselves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>(e) Conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during, and after the crime, indicating a common design, concerted acts, and concurrence of sentiments. In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all. Consequently, the precise extent or modality of participation of each co-conspirator becomes secondary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></center><br><br>By its assailed Decision dated March 13, 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the appeal is DENIED.

The first refers to <i>express conspiracy. </i>It requires proof of an actual agreement among the co-conspirators to commit the crime. The second pertains to <i>implied conspiracy. </i>It exists when two (2) or more persons are shown by their acts to have aimed toward the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their combined acts, though apparently independent, are in fact connected and cooperative, indicating closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiments. This is proved by the mode and manner the offense was committed, or from the acts of the accused <i>before, during, and after </i>the commission of the crime, indubitably pointing to a joint purpose, a concert of action, and a community of interest.<br><br>In fine, even without proof of express agreement among the co-accused, conspiracy may still be held to exist among them.

Without doubt, accused-appellant and his co-accused took advantage of the situation.

The <i>raison d'etre </i>for the law requiring a direct overt act is that, in a majority of cases, the conduct of the accused consisting merely of acts of preparation has never ceased to be equivocal; and this is necessarily so, irrespective of his declared intent. It is that quality of being equivocal that must be lacking before the act becomes one which may be said to be a commencement of the commission of the crime, or an overt act or before any fragment of the crime itself has been committed, and this is so for the reason that so long as the equivocal quality remains, no one can say with certainty what the intent of the accused is. It is necessary that the overt act should have been the ultimate step towards the consummation of the design. It is sufficient if it was the "first or some subsequent step in a direct movement towards the commission of the offense after the preparations are made." The act done need not constitute the last proximate one for completion. It is necessary, however, that the attempt must have a causal relation to the intended crime. In the words of Viada, the overt acts must have an immediate and necessary relation to the offense.</blockquote><br><br>In the case at bar, petitioners, who acted in concert, commenced the felony of murder by mauling the victim and hitting him three times with a hollow block; they narrowly missed hitting the middle portion of his head. If Edgardo had done so, Ruben would surely have died.</blockquote><br><br>As stated, the attendant circumstances here clearly show that appellant and his companions did intend to kill the Evangelista brothers. They were able to deal multiple fatal blows on at least three (3) of the brothers; but as for Eric, they did not spare him. He was also stabbed by Baynosa.

The Court of Appeals reasoned:<br><br><blockquote>When actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000.00, the award of temperate damages for P25,000.00 is justified in lieu of actual damages of a lesser amount.

But they were only able to present receipts up to Thirteen Thousand and One Hundred Pesos (P13,100.00). The Court then, adopted the pronouncement in <i><b>People v. Albrazado</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> where the Court granted temperate damages, in lieu of actual damages, in the amount of Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00). The Court said in <i><b>Albrazado </b></i>that it "would be unfair for the victim's heirs to get nothing, despite the death of their kin, for the reason alone that they cannot produce any receipts."<br><br>Thus, in <i><b>Villanueva, </b></i>the Court said that it would be <i>"unfair" </i>for Villanueva's heirs to be awarded with only Thirteen Thousand One Hundred Pesos <b>(P13,100.00) </b><i>"because the victim's heirs who tried but succeeded in proving actual damages to the extent of P13,100 only, would be in a worse situation than, say, those who might have presented no receipts at all but would now be entitled to P25,000 temperate damages." </i>The Court ruled that <i>"when actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000, as in this case, the award of temperate damages for P25,000 is justified in lieu of actual damages of a lesser amount. Conversely, if the amount of actual damages proven exceeds P25,000, then temperate damages may no longer be awarded; actual damages based on the receipts presented during trial should instead be granted"</i><br><br>Here, Eric's full claim was only Seven Thousand and Thirty-Two Pesos (P7,032.00). No more, no less. For it was the only amount he spent for his treatment. Why then should he be given Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00)? It would certainly be unjust for appellant to be compelled to pay more than what Eric actually claimed to have spent for his treatment, <i>i.e. </i>Seven Thousand and Thirty-Two Pesos (P7,032.00), exactly the amount covered by the receipts the People offered as Exhibits "M" to "M-7."<br><br>It is, therefore, incorrect for the Court to award more than the amount Eric Evangelista actually incurred for his treatment, let alone, beyond what Eric Evangelista himself claimed to have actually spent.<br><br><i>Criminal Case No. L-8888<br>Frustrated Murder</i><br><br>Article 50 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 50. <i>Penalty to be imposed upon principals of a frustrated crime. </i>— The penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed by law for the consummated felony shall be imposed upon the principal in a frustrated felony.</blockquote><br><br>In the absence of any modifying circumstances, the imposable penalty for frustrated murder is <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its medium period. Applying the indeterminate sentence law, appellant was correctly sentenced to eight (8) years of <i>prision mayor, </i>as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal, </i>as maximum.<br><br>As for civil liabilities, <i><b>Jugueta </b></i>decreed:<br><br><blockquote>II.
