				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The outcome of this case will greatly affect, for the next two decades, all consumers of electricity in the Philippines, which include the over 95 million Filipinos living in the Philippines as well as the millions of business enterprises operating in the Philippines.<br><br>Section 19, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution provides: "<b>The State shall regulate or prohibit monopolies when the public interest so requires.</b> No combinations in restraint of trade or unfair competition shall be allowed."<br><br>The State grants electricity distribution utilities, through legislative franchises, a regulated monopoly within their respective franchise areas. Competitors are legally barred within the franchise areas of distribution utilities. Facing no competition, distribution utilities can easily dictate the price of electricity that they charge consumers. To protect the consuming public from exorbitant or unconscionable charges by distribution utilities, the State regulates the acquisition cost of electricity that distribution utilities can pass on to consumers.<br><br>As part of its regulation of this monopoly, the State requires distribution utilities to subject to <b>competitive public bidding</b> their purchases of electricity from power generating companies. Competitive public bidding is <b>essential</b> since the power cost purchased by distribution utilities is entirely passed on to consumers, along with other operating expenses of distribution utilities. <b>Competitive public bidding is the most efficient, transparent, and effective guarantee that there will be no price gouging by distribution utilities.</b><br><br>Indeed, the requirement of competitive public bidding for power purchases of distribution utilities has been adopted in the United States, Europe, Latin America, India, and many developing countries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> This requirement is primarily aimed at ensuring a fair, reasonable, and least-cost generation charge to consumers, under a transparent power sale mechanism between the generation companies and the distribution utilities.<br><br>Section 6, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution provides: "The use of property bears a social function, and all economic agents shall contribute to the common good. Individuals and private groups, including corporations, cooperatives, and similar collective organizations, shall have the right to own, establish, and operate economic enterprises, <b>subject to the duty of the State to promote distributive justice and to intervene when the common good so demands</b>."<br><br>Indisputably, the use of electricity bears a vital social function. The State, in requiring competitive public bidding in the purchase of power by distribution utilities, has exercised its constitutional "duty x x x to intervene when the common good so demands."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The breakdown of charges in a Manila Electric Company (<b>Meralco</b>) bill contains the following: <b><i>Generation Charge</i></b>, Transmission Charge, System Loss Charge, Distribution Charge (Meralco), Subsidies, Government Taxes, Universal Charges, FiT-All Charge (Renewable), and Other Charges. <b>The Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) involved in the present case were executed in April 2016 and have terms that range from 20 to 21 years.</b><br><br>Section 43 of Republic Act No. 9136, or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (<b>EPIRA</b>), includes a description, in broad strokes, of the functions of the Energy Regulatory Commission (<b>ERC</b>): "The ERC shall <b>promote competition</b>, encourage market development, ensure customer choice and <b>discourage/penalize abuse of market power</b> in the restructured electricity industry." Moreover, Section 2 of the EPIRA declares it a state policy to "<b>ensure the x x x affordability of the supply of electric power</b>." Further, Section 45 of the EPIRA mandates the ERC to enforce safeguards to "<b>promote true market competition and prevent harmful monopoly and market power abuse</b>." If the ERC violates its statutory functions, this Court, as mandated by Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> has the duty to strike down the acts of ERC whenever these are performed with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><center><u><b>The Case</b></u><br></center><br>Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas, Inc.

Named as respondents are the ERC, the Department of Energy (DOE), Meralco, Central Luzon Premiere Power Corporation (CLPPC), St. Raphael Power Generation Corporation (SRPGC), Panay Energy Development Corporation (PEDC), Mariveles Power Generation Corporation (MPGC), Global Luzon Energy Development Corporation (GLEDC), Atimonan One Energy, Inc. (AIE), Redondo Peninsula Energy, Inc. (RPE), and the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC).<br><br>The petition seeks to declare as void ERC Resolution No. 1, Series of 2016 (<b>ERC Clarificatory Resolution</b>). The petition also seeks that this Court direct the ERC to disapprove the Power Supply Agreements (<b>PSAs</b>) of the Distribution Utilities (<b>DUs</b>) submitted after 7 November 2015 for failure to conduct Competitive Selection Process (<b>CSP</b>). The petition further asks the Court to order ERC to implement CSP in accordance with the Department of Energy (<b>DOE</b>) Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 (<b>2015 DOE Circular</b>) and ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 (<b>CSP Guidelines</b>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></center><br>On 11 June 2015, the DOE issued the 2015 DOE Circular entitled "<b>Mandating All Distribution Utilities to Undergo Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in Securing Power Supply Agreements (PSA)</b>." Sections 3 and 10 of the 2015 DOE Circular provide:<br><blockquote><b>Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of the CSP. After the effectivity of this Circular, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and the DOE.</b> In the case of [Electric Cooperatives (ECs)], the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).<br><br>Under this Circular, CSPs for the procurement of PSAs of all DUs shall observe the following:<br><blockquote>(a) Aggregation for un-contracted demand requirements of DUs;<br>(b) Annually conducted; and<br>(c) Uniform template for the terms and conditions in the PSA to be issued by the ERC in coordination with the DOE.<br></blockquote>Within one hundred twenty (120) days from the effectivity of this Circular, the ERC and [the] DOE shall jointly issue the guidelines and procedures for the aggregation of the un-contracted demand requirements of the DUs and the process for the recognition or accreditation of the Third Party that conducts the CSP as hereto provided. For clarity, the term aggregation as used in this Circular refers to the wholesale demand and energy requirements of DUs, and not of the Contestable Markets under Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) regime.<br><br>As used in this section, the un-contracted demand or energy requirements of the DUs shall refer to the energy and demand not yet procured individually or collectively by the DUs, excluding those energy and capacity covered by PSAs that have been filed for approval before the ERC.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 10. Effectivity. <b>This Circular shall take effect immediately upon its publication</b> in two (2) newspapers of general circulation and <b>shall remain in effect until otherwise revoked</b>. (Boldfacing added)<br></blockquote><b>Section 3 of the 2015 DOE Circular expressly and categorically mandates CSP, or competitive public bidding, whenever DUs secure PSAs. The 2015 DOE Circular took effect on 30 June 2015 upon its publication in two newspapers of general circulation. Section 3 expressly states that "<i>[a]fter the effectivity of this Circular, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through CSP x x x</i>."</b><br><br>On 20 October 2015, Joint Resolution No. 1 (<b>Joint Resolution</b>), executed by the DOE and the ERC, reiterated the need to adopt a "<b>regime of transparent process in securing Power Supply Agreements</b>." The fifth Whereas clause of the Joint Resolution provides:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the DOE and ERC recognize the adoption of competitive selection as a policy that will encourage investments in the power generation business thereby ensuring electric power supply availability in <b>a regime of transparent process in securing Power Supply Agreements</b> (PSAs), which is an integral part of the power sector reform agenda. (Boldfacing added)<br></blockquote>Under the Joint Resolution, the DOE and the ERC agreed that ERC shall issue the appropriate regulation <b>to implement</b> CSP. Section 1 of the Joint Resolution states:<br><blockquote>Section 1. Competitive Selection Process. <b>Consistent with their respective mandates</b>, the DOE and ERC recognize that Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the procurement of Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) by the DUs engenders transparency, enhances security of supply, and ensures stability of electricity prices to captive electricity end-users in the long-term. <b>Consequently, by agreement of the DOE and ERC, the ERC shall issue the appropriate regulation to <i>implement</i> the same.</b> (Boldfacing and italicization added)<br></blockquote>On the same date, 20 October 2015, the ERC issued the CSP Guidelines, which directed all DUs to conduct CSP in the procurement of their power supply for their captive markets.<br><br>The CSP Guidelines fixed a new date of effectivity for compliance with CSP. This is the first instance that the ERC unilaterally fixed a different date from 30 June 2015, <b>effectively postponing the date of effectivity of CSP from 30 June 2015 to 7 November 2015 or by 130 days</b>:<br><blockquote><b>Section 4. Applicability. The CSP requirement herein mandated shall not apply to PSAs already filed with the ERC <i>as of the effectivity of this Resolution</i>. For PSAs already executed but are not yet filed or for those that are still in the process of negotiation, the concerned DUs are directed to comply with the CSP requirement before their PSA applications will be accepted by the ERC.</b><br><br>This Resolution shall take effect immediately following its publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines.<br><br>x x x x (Boldfacing and italicization added)<br></blockquote>Based on its provisions, the CSP Guidelines took effect on 7 November 2015, following its publication in the <i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i> and the <i>Philippine Star</i>. Section 4 of the CSP Guidelines expressly provides that CSP "<b>shall not apply to PSAs already filed with the ERC <i>as of the effectivity of this Resolution</i></b>." <b>Thus, the ERC no longer required CSP for all PSAs already filed with the ERC on or before 7 November 2015.</b> Section 4 of the CSP Guidelines further states that "[f]or PSAs already executed but are not yet filed or for those that are still in the process of negotiation, the concerned DUs are directed to comply with the CSP requirement before their PSA applications will be accepted by the ERC."<br><br><b>On 15 March 2016, however, the ERC, for the second time, unilaterally postponed the date of effectivity of CSP. The ERC issued the ERC Clarificatory Resolution, which restated the date of effectivity of the CSP Guidelines from 7 November 2015 to 30 April 2016.</b> Paragraph 1 of the ERC Clarificatory Resolution reads:<br><blockquote>1. <b>The effectivity of the CSP [Guidelines] is hereby restated to be 30 April 2016.</b> All PSAs executed on or after the said date shall be required, without exception, to comply with the provisions of the CSP [Guidelines]. (Boldfacing added)<br></blockquote><b>The second postponement of the effectivity of CSPfrom 7 November 2015 to 30 April 2016, or by 175 days, allowed DUs to enter into contracts during the period of postponement to avoid the mandatory CSP.</b><br><br>The table below shows that the following PSAs between Meralco and its power suppliers were executed and submitted to the ERC <b>within 10 days prior the restated 30 April 2016 deadline</b>.

All these instances merely implement CSP, and do not postpone CSP or amend the 2015 DOE Circular, which are beyond mere implementation of CSP. If the ERC cannot act by itself on certain instances in the mere implementation of CSP, then the ERC certainly cannot act by itself in the postponement of CSP or in the amendment of the 2015 DOE Circular.<br><br>We reiterate that the ERC unilaterally postponed the effectivity of the mandatory CSP <b>twice</b>. The ERC made the first unilateral postponement on 20 October 2015, when it stated that PSAs already filed with the ERC on or before 7 November 2015 were not required to undergo CSP. This first unilateral postponement was from 30 June 2015 to 7 November 2015, or a period of postponement of 130 days. The ERC made a second unilateral postponement on 15 March 2016, when it restated the effectivity of the CSP Guidelines from 7 November 2015 to 30 April 2016, or a postponement of 175 days. <b>All in all, the ERC, by itself and without authorization from or coordination with the DOE, postponed the effectivity of the mandatory CSP for 305 days.</b><br><br>The ERC thus amended, and not merely supplemented, the "guidelines and procedures to properly guide the DUs and the Third Party in the design and execution of the CSP."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> This is contrary to what the 2015 DOE Circular clearly intended - that CSP shall take effect upon the Circular's publication on 30 June 2015.<br><br>In its Comment to the present petition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> <b>the DOE denied any responsibility in the ERC's restatement of the effective date in the ERC Clarificatory Resolution</b>.

This is clear from the EPIRA and the 2015 DOE Circular. Indeed, Justice Reyes in his Dissenting Opinion belabored this delegated power by underscoring the existence of the Joint Resolution. Justice Reyes misunderstood the delegation of power to mean that the Joint Resolution, by itself, is the required "coordination" in the implementation of CSP. Under this theory of Justice Reyes, the required "coordination" could take place <b>only once</b> upon the issuance of the Joint Resolution, and there can be no other coordination required in the future even if the ERC issues additional guidelines or regulations to implement CSP. This interpretation is obviously erroneous.<br><br>Moreover, <b>the ERC's power is neither absolute nor unbridled</b>. The ERC can only promulgate rules, but only insofar as it is authorized. Section 4(b) of Rule 3 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the EPIRA states:<br><blockquote>Pursuant to Sections 43 and 45 of the Act, <b>the ERC shall promulgate such rules and regulations <i>as authorized thereby</i></b>, including but not limited to Competition Rules and limitations on recovery of system losses, and shall impose fines or penalties for any non-compliance with or breach of the Act, these Rules and the rules and regulations which it promulgates or administers.

In short, the ERC could not issue CSP guidelines and procedures without coordination with DOE. The DOE has expressly declared that the ERC did not coordinate with DOE in issuing the ERC Clarificatory Resolution. The ERC's unilateral postponement of CSP for 305 days, allowing DUs to avoid the mandatory CSP to the great prejudice of the public, was clearly without authority and manifestly constituted grave abuse of discretion. Moreover, the ERC's unilateral postponement of CSP egregiously prevented "transparency" and resulted in inefficiency by delaying the implementation of CSP.<br><br>In their Dissenting Opinions, Justice Reyes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and Justice Caguioa<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> both use the DOE's letter dated 18 January 2016,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> which requested the ERC to allow an electric cooperative (Abra Electric Cooperative, Inc.

(ABRECO) dated 24 November 2015, seeking DOE's endorsement to ERC to allow ABRECO to directly negotiate with a power supplier for their short-term requirement in its quest for a secured and affordable power supply and to consequently relieve them from full exposure with the WESM.<br><br>In its attached letter to ERC, ABRECO mentioned that AES is considering a 2MW Interim supply for the EC's power requirements for the next three (3) years from 2016 to 2018. We welcome this as a positive move for the improvement of ABRECO's operations, thus, we are endorsing for ERC's consideration to allow ABRECO to directly negotiate with a power supplier for its short-term requirement, albeit the requirement for competitive selection process. This request is made in consideration of ABRECO's situation as an ailing EC and to prevent its vulnerability to volatile WESM prices given its supply [is] sourced from the WESM currently. This endorsement, however, does not preclude the ERC from exercising its authority to evaluate the DUs Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) and require further action, such as, but not limited to subjecting ABRECO's PSA to a Swiss challenge.<br><br>For your consideration.

To recall, ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 is the resolution whose effectivity was "restated" by the assailed issuance herein, ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016. In the "whereas clauses" of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015, DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, which had originally set the parameters of authority of the DOE and the ERC anent the implementation of the CSP, was explicitly recognized, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREAS</b>, on June 11, 2015, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued Department Circular No. [DC2015-06-0008], <i>Mandating All Distribution Utilities to Undergo Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in Securing Power Supply Agreements (PSA)</i>;<br><br><b>WHEREAS</b>, on October 20, 2015, the DOE and the ERC approved the issuance of a Joint Resolution embodying their agreement on the CSP, particularly, that the ERC shall issue the appropriate regulations requiring the DUs to undertake a CSP for the PSAs they will enter into for the supply to their captive market;<br><br><b>WHEREAS</b>, the ERC and the DOE are convinced that there is an advantage to be gained by having a CSP in place, in terms of ensuring transparency in the DUs' supply procurement and providing opportunities to elicit the best price offers and other PSA terms and conditions from suppliers;<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>As per its terms, ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 not only sets the guidelines for the design and execution of the CSP, but also clearly supplements DOE Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008. Thus, it stands to reason that ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 is the embodiment of the phrase "appropriate regulations" contemplated under the Joint Resolution issued by both agencies to implement the CSP.<br><br>In this case, it is apparent that both the DOE and the ERC are intent on implementing the CSP. <u><b>DOE Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 already mandated that upon its effeetivity on June 30,2015, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through the CSP.</b></u> However, as noted in the <i>ponencia</i>, the ERC, unilaterally postponed the date of effectivity of the CSP from June 30, 2015 to November 7, 2015, marking the first postponement by the ERC of the effectivity of the mandatory CSP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This appears to be in pursuance of the first paragraph of Section 4 of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015, which reads:<br><blockquote>Section 4.

For PSAs already executed but are not yet filed or for those that are still in the process of negotiation, the concerned DUs are directed to comply with the CSP requirement before their PSA applications will be accepted by the ERC.<br></blockquote>The implementation of the CSP requirement was further stalled by the ERC for another five (5) months, particularly, up until April 30, 2016, through the issuance of ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The main reason for this subsequent postponement was the "several letters from stakeholders"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> received by the ERC expressing certain reservations anent the implementation thereof.<br><br>As I see it, ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016 cannot qualify as a supplemental guideline for the design and execution of the CSP as contemplated under the ERC's delegated authority pursuant to Section 4 of DOE Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008. Contrary to the very nature of a supplemental guideline, ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016 does not merely add or clarify the existing regulations on the CSP, but rather completely halts its implementation. Accordingly, it cannot fall under the phrase "appropriate regulations" under Section 1 of Joint Resolution No. 1, as agreed upon by the DOE and the ERC. To reiterate, the ERC was not given sole discretion under Joint Resolution No. 1 to promulgate whatever rules it deems fit to implement the CSP. This is, in fact, further confirmed by the Comment of the DOE itself wherein it denied any responsibility in the ERC's restatement of the CSP's date of effectivity:<br><blockquote>15. <b>DOE is not aware of the cut-off date shift.</b> There is nothing on record that ERC, <b>contrary to Section 4 of the [2015] DOE Circular</b>, coordinated with DOE in "restating" the date of the effectivity to a later date, or from 7 November 2015 to 30 April 2016 for a period of one-hundred and seventy-five (175) days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, since the ERC had no authority to suspend the implementation of the CSP on its own, it gravely abused its discretion in issuing ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016 and hence, ought to be declared void.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i>, however, proceeds to also invalidate the first paragraph of Section 4 of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015, as the said provision marked the first postponement of the CSP implementation from June 30, 2015 (as per the original DOE Circular) to November 7, 2015. As the dispositive of the <i>ponencia</i> reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The first paragraph of Section 4 of the Energy Regulatory Commission Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 (CSP Guidelines), and the Energy Regulatory Commission Resolution No. 1, Series of 2016 (ERC Clarificatory Resolution), are hereby declared <b>VOID <i>ab initio</i></b>. Consequently, all Power Supply Agreement applications submitted by Distribution Utilities to the Energy Regulatory Commission on or after 30 June 2015 shall comply with the Competitive Selection Process in accordance with the Department of Energy Circular No. DC2018-02-0003 (2018 DOE Circular) and its Annex "A". Upon compliance with the Competitive Selection Process, the power purchase cost resulting from such compliance shall retroact to the date of effectivity of the complying Power Supply Agreement, but in no case earlier than June 30, 2015, for purpose of passing on the power purchase cost to consumers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Respectfully, I disagree with the holding anent the first paragraph of Section 4 of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 because the validity of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 was not questioned in the present petition. In any case, it is my view that there was nothing infirm about the failure to implement the CSP by June 30, 2015 and postponing the same to November 7, 2015. This is because the CSP could not have been implemented by the time the original DOE Circular took effect on June 30, 2015 given that there were no proper implementing guidelines at that time. Based on the records, it was only upon the issuance of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 (which took effect later on November 7, 2015) that concrete guidelines on the CSP were set. Notably, this latter ERC Resolution was issued on the same day Joint Resolution No. 1 was issued by both the DOE and the ERC, and in this joint resolution, the authority of the ERC to issue the appropriate guidelines to implement the CSP, <i>by agreement of the DOE and the ERC</i>, was recognized. In fact, there is an express statement by the DOE in the original DOE Circular that the ERC was still to issue supplemental guidelines and procedures for the design and execution of the CSP to properly guide the DUs; hence, the immediate effectivity of the CSP requirement could not be reckoned as of June 30, 2015. Accordingly, for these reasons, only ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016 - and not the first paragraph of Section 4 of ERC Resolution No. 13, Series of 2015 - should be declared null and void.<br><br>Also, albeit not explicitly expressed in the <i>ponencia</i>, I caution against the wholesale invalidation of PSAs which were non-compliant with the CSP requirement at the time the said process should have been carried out, which date the <i>ponencia</i> pegs on June 30, 2015. Being in the nature of a selection and qualification requirement, compliance with the CSP to already existing - more so, implemented - PSAs appears to be impossible, unless one invalidates the entire contract. Logically speaking, it is highly impracticable to reverse the consummation of acts already done. This being the case, it may be prudent to recognize the validity of the effects of the PSAs already approved prior to the invalidity of ERC Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016, notwithstanding their CSP non-compliance. Lest it be misunderstood, this does not necessarily mean that the approved PSAs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> shall be valid and effective for their entire full 20 or 21-year term. The compromise to this matter is to only recognize these contracts' validity up until a new DU, <u><i>selected under the applicable CSP process</i></u>, has qualified to take-over the obligations for the remaining period in accordance with the appropriate transitory regulations to be issued by the proper governing agency/agencies. To my mind, this approach balances out the legalistic attribution of the questioned issuance with the practical impact that the afore-discussed declaration would have on the power industry and on a larger scale, the consuming public in general.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition based on the qualifications stated above. Energy Regulatory Commission Resolution No. 01, Series of 2016 should be declared <b>INVALID</b> for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion.

As the Court <i>En Banc</i> recently held in <i>Gios-Samar, Inc. v. DOTC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (<i>Gios-Samar</i>):<br><blockquote>In fine, while this Court has original and concurrent jurisdiction with the RTC and the CA in the issuance of writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i> (extraordinary writs), <u><b>direct recourse to this Court is proper only to seek resolution of questions of law</b></u>. Save for the single specific instance provided by the Constitution under Section 18, Article VII, cases the resolution of which depends on the determination of questions of fact cannot be brought directly before the Court because we are not a trier of facts. <u><b>We are not equipped, either by structure or rule, to receive and evaluate evidence in the first instance; these are the primary functions of the lower courts or regulatory agencies.</b></u> This is the <i>raison d'etre</i> behind the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. It operates as a constitutional filtering mechanism designed to enable this Court to focus on the more fundamental tasks assigned to it by the Constitution. It is a bright-line rule which cannot be brushed aside by an invocation of the transcendental importance or constitutional dimension of the issue or cause raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, the <i>ponencia</i> committed a grave error in taking cognizance of the petition as it violates the long-standing doctrine of hierarchy of courts — a doctrine that, according to the pronouncement of the Court in <i>Gios-Samar</i>, is not simply a matter of policy but is, in fact, a constitutional imperative. This is so because, to borrow the language of the Court in <i>Gios-Samar</i>, the Court's "<b><i>sole</i></b> role is to apply the law based on the <b><u>findings</u> of facts <u>brought</u> before us</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> More importantly:<br><blockquote>x x x Strict adherence to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts also proceeds from considerations of due process. While the term "due process of law" evades exact and concrete definition, this Court, in one of its earliest decisions, referred to it as a law which hears before it condemns which proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial. It means that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property, and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society. Under the present Rules of Court, which governs our judicial proceedings, warring factual allegations of parties are settled through presentation of evidence. Evidence is the means of ascertaining, in a judicial proceeding, the truth respecting a matter of fact. As earlier demonstrated, the Court cannot accept evidence <i>in the first instance</i>. By directly filing a case before the Court, litigants necessarily deprive themselves of the opportunity to completely pursue or defend their causes of actions. Their right to due process is effectively undermined by their own doing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>The foregoing viewpoint from the lens of due process squarely applies in the present case considering that there are a number of cases, administrative and criminal — some of which have pending incidents before the Court — that are directly intertwined with the facts of the present case. Therefore, a finding that the ERC, as a body, committed grave abuse of discretion based on <b><i>incomplete and contested facts</i></b>, would be unfair and would constitute a violation of due process for respondents and the several accused in the said cases.<br><br><b><i>Nature and procedure for approval of PSAs</i></b><br><br>PSAs are contracts between a DU and a power producer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <u><b>PSAs</b></u>, which are bilateral power supply contracts, <u><b>are made subject to review by the ERC</b></u> precisely to promote true market competition and prevent harmful monopoly and market power abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The process to get ERC approval for PSAs, based on the ERC Rules, is as follows:<br><br>Even before an application is lodged with the ERC, the DUs and the power producers (or GenCos) have already negotiated and executed material documents that comprise their commercial agreements.

Mr. President, obviously, if the GENCOs are charging more than what they should, -- although I do not see how that could possibly happen, because the line starts actually with 29jj and it says "upon the finding," and there has to be a finding that a market participant has engaged in such act or behavior, meaning anticompetitive or discriminatory act or abuse of market power -- the ERC shall stop and redress the same.

Supposing that the GENCO, which is owned 30% by a distributor, owns not only the shares of that distributor, but the distributor and the GENCO both commonly own the subtransformer and they enter into a contract at a certain price which is higher than the others. The distributor prefers to buy the electric power from the GENCO because the GENCO is reliable and has shown efficiency in the regular and constant delivery of power service. As a result, it gets more profits. Would that be an excess profit warranting price controls?<br><br>Senator Osmeña (J). Mr. President, there are a number of, shall we say, conditions or circumstances that the gentleman is talking about all in one situation. <u><b>But the fact is that, the price at which a distribution utility sells to its customers is regulated by the regulatory body. If that distribution utility buys power at a higher rate than the full price, the ERB will not allow it to charge the difference. <i>So, there is a control of how much it can sell this power because that control is coming from the regulatory authority</i>.</b></u><br><br>The question is whether, hypothetic-ally, a distribution company may choose on the ground of better service or reliability to buy power from a distribution company at a higher cost than its competitor. And the answer to that question is in the affirmative, Mr. President.<br><br>If the distribution company makes money in excess of what is generally accepted as the norm of return, then that would be what we call excess profits.<br><br>Senator Guingona. <b>So, the ERC would be in a position to impose price controls?</b><br><br><b><u>Senator Osmeña (J). That is correct, Mr. President. I mean, in an event like that, the ERC, in fact, does impose. That is the very nature of the ERC.

The purpose of the CSP is to compel DUs to purchase their electric power at a transparent, fair, reasonable, and competitive cost, since this cost is passed on to consumers.

The ERC will still have to look into the many factors enumerated above, including the procurement process of the distribution utility, in order to see how the proposal from the GenCo will be the least costly to its captive market. In fact, one of the first things that the applicant will submit to the ERC is the effect of the contract on the overall rates of the DU.<br><br>It is therefore premature, if not outrightly erroneous, to claim that the executions of the PSAs during the transition period have placed the CSP into "deep freeze" for the duration of the PSAs, and that the public will be prejudiced. During the transition period provided by Resolution No. 1, and even before the implementation of the CSP, the ERC, in compliance with its mandate under the EPIRA, has the power — <b><i>nay, the duty</i></b> — to ensure that any bilateral power supply contracts entered into by the DUs will be consistent with their mandate that they supply electricity to their captive market in the least cost manner.<br><br>Although the CSP is one manner by which this is attained, its non-application to the PSAs in this case — which, again, have yet to be approved — does not mean that the PSAs would prejudice the public. Once more, the EPIRA and its IRR are clear that acts that harm customers and those that prohibit participation of GenCos to increase market prices are prohibited. <b><u>These preceded the institution of the CSP and remain to be in force even if the CSP is implemented.</u> Thus, <u><i>with or without the CSP</i></u>, the public is protected from practices that harm them or that would result in market increases arising from non-competitive practices.</b> As stated above, the ERC, among other powers, may direct the disgorgement of excess profits and impose price control mechanisms, all with the objective of ensuring the reasonableness of the price of electricity.<br><br><b><i>The ERC is an independent regulatory body separate and distinct from the DOE</i></b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> rules that the ERC does not have the power to supplant the policies of the DOE<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and that ERC's powers are limited to the enforcement of rules and regulations of the EPIRA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, it should be noted that in issuing Resolutions Nos. 13 and 1, the ERC did <u><i>not</i></u> supplant any policy of the DOE.<br><br>First of all, it should be emphasized that the ERC, under the EPIRA, is a purely <u><b>independent</b></u> regulatory body performing the combined quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative and administrative functions in the electric industry.<br><br>Section 38 of the EPIRA mandated the creation of an "independent, quasi-judicial regulatory body to be named the Energy Regulatory Commission." <b>To be sure, one of the most important changes introduced by the EPIRA in the restructuring of the energy industry was <u>the creation of an <i>independent regulatory body</i></u>.</b> Section 2 of the EPIRA states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2.

In fact, the effective date of the CSP Guidelines of November 7, 2015 was set only by Resolution No. 13 which, in turn, the ERC could <i>solely</i> issue precisely because it was empowered by the law, <i>i.e.</i>, the EPIRA.

Thus, the restatement of the effectivity date of the CSP implementation from November 7, 2015 to April 30, 2016, virtually creating a transition period of five (5) months, was deemed by the ERC a long enough period to allow fruition of the PSAs at the throes of perfection or those already executed but not yet filed, and short enough to block those PSAs which were still too early in the negotiation or so far from execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The ERC found that granting a period of transition would avoid the risk of inconsistency in resolving the individual requests for exemptions sought by DUs, GenCos and electric cooperatives — <b>while, at the same, <u><i>ensuring a steady electric supply for the period covered by the different calls for the CSP exemption</i></u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>And, as the regulator, ERC had full knowledge and complete sense of the difficulty of adding a new requirement to an application for the approval of a PSA when the DUs and the GenCos had already executed their PSAs. <u><b><i>In fact, requiring a CSP would most likely have resulted in the undoing of heavily and lengthily negotiated and executed agreements over which many computations and projections had already been done.</i></b></u><br><br>A review of the requirements enumerated above shows that in addition to the executed PSA, the parties are required to disclose their sources of funding, a sample computation of power rates, and even a breakdown of operating and maintenance expenses. <u><b>The undoing of a PSA and a re-negotiation of its terms will affect these figures and may even result in the replacement of the GenCos.

The courts give much weight to contemporaneous construction because of the respect due the government agency or officials charged with the implementation of the law, their competence, expertness, experience and informed judgment, and the fact that they frequently are the drafters of the law they interpret.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, I submit anew that the Court stepped out of bounds in annulling the acts of a regulator acting within the bounds of law and its area of expertise. Indeed, this sends a chilling effect on all regulators. This is true in this case because the acts of the ERC have been made the basis of administrative and criminal complaints.<br><br>While an action by an administrative agency may be set aside by the judicial department, it must only be done if there is abuse of power, lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion clearly conflicting with the letter and spirit of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> There is no such situation here.

Competitive Selection Process.</b> Consistent with their respective mandates, the DOE and ERC recognize that Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the procurement of PSAs by the DUs engenders transparency, enhances security of supply, and ensures stability of electricity prices to captive electricity end-users in the long-term. <b><u>Consequently, by agreement of the DOE and ERC, the ERC shall issue the appropriate regulations to implement the same.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, while the language of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 empowers the DOE and the ERC jointly to issue the relevant guidelines in the implementation of the CSP, in turn, the DOE, through Joint Resolution No. 1, gave its concurrence to and duly empowered the ERC to act and to issue the appropriate regulations.<br><br>On the strength of the provisions of the EPIRA, EPIRA's IRR, DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, and Joint Resolution No. 1, the ERC thence promulgated ERC Resolution No. 13, as well as the assailed ERC Resolution No. 1. These resolutions contained the relevant rules and regulations that govern the implementation of the CSP policy of the government—a power which has been specifically delegated to the ERC and to no other. Notably, none of the parties in this case challenged this power. In fact, this authority was recognized by the DOE in its Letter dated January 18, 2016 when it requested the ERC to allow an electric cooperative to directly negotiate with a power supplier despite the CSP requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the <i>ponencia</i>, however, it was stated that the ERC had no authority to issue ERC Resolution No. 1, because the ERC cannot <i>unilaterally</i> restate the effectivity of its earlier resolution for doing so violates DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008. It was likewise explained therein that "the DOE Circular [No. DC2015-06-0008] <u><b>specifically stated</b></u> that <u><b>the ERC's power to issue CSP guidelines and procedures should be done in coordination with the DOE</b></u>." That the ERC "restated" the date of effectivity unilaterally is, according to the <i>ponencia</i>, an "amendment" of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, which the ERC could not do. The <i>ponencia</i> further held that the ERC is empowered only to issue "supplemental guidelines and procedures" as this is the only power granted by Section 4 of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 to the ERC.<br><br>Likewise, the <i>ponencia</i> declared that ERC Resolution No. 1 is void because it was issued without the concurrence of the DOE, and as such, it was in excess of ERC s rule-making power.<br><br>Finally, the <i>ponencia</i> further launched a full discourse on the power of the DOE <i>vis-a-vis</i> the power of the ERC, such that, it argued that, it is the former which formulates the policies, rules, regulations, and circulars concerning the energy sector, and the latter should <u><b>only</b></u> enforce and implement the same. The opinion likewise quoted in its entirety Section 43 of the EPIRA (enumerating the powers of the ERC) and stated that nothing therein could "supplant" the policies, rules, regulations, or circulars prescribed by the DOE.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i>, however, fails to consider the clear mandate of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 and Joint Resolution No. 1.<br><br>First, it is not correct to summarily state that the ERC's power is limited to the implementation of a policy dictated by the ERC. It could not be any clearer when Section 3 of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, as quoted above, specifically stated that "the ERC and DOE shall <u><b>jointly</b></u> issue the guidelines and procedures for the aggregation of the un-contracted demand requirements of the DUs and the process for the recognition or accreditation of the Third Party that conducts the CSP as hereto provided." This is not a case where the DOE issues a policy and then the ERC implements the policy. As can be read in Section 3, the matter of formulating the guidelines, as well as the rules of procedure for its implementation, falls on <u><b>both</b></u> the DOE and the ERC.<br><br>Second, this joint authority, as it were, is further clarified by Joint Resolution No. 1 where the DOE specifically delegated unto the ERC the power to issue the appropriate regulations to implement the CSP. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this could only mean that, contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>, the DOE and the ERC already have a "coordination" with regard to their duties of implementing the CSP, and the <u><b>DOE already authorized the ERC to perform this duty</b></u>. Again, the ERC in this case is not a mere implementing agency, rather, it is the main agency tasked and empowered to lay the ground for the new selection process, the same being the agency which has the direct contact with the affected stakeholders of the energy sector.<br><br>Indeed, even the <i>ponencia</i> recognized this when it was mentioned that:<br><blockquote>Joint Resolution No. 1 (Joint Resolution), executed by the DOE and the ERC on 20 October 2015, reiterated that <u><b>the ERC shall issue the appropriate regulations to implement the CSP</b></u>. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Third, it is also misplaced to say that the ERC has no power at all to formulate the rules and regulations concerning the CSP because, according to the <i>ponencia</i>, the same power does not appear in the enumeration of the ERC's functions in Section 43 of the EPIRA. But paragraph (m) of the same section in fact authorizes the ERC to:<br><br><b>(m) Take any action delegated to it pursuant to this Act;</b><br><br>This function, taken together with the DOE and ERC's joint authority accorded by Section 3 of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 and the specific delegation in Section 1 of Joint Resolution No. 1, is more than enough to dispel any accusation of impropriety or any lack of authority to the ERC's issuance of the assailed resolution. In the language of Section 43 of the EPIRA, the ERC did not "supplant" the policies, rules, regulations, or circulars prescribed by the DOE, instead, the ERC merely accepted the action "delegated" to it pursuant to DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 and Joint Resolution No. 1.<br><br>Finally, it must also be emphasized that Joint Resolution No. 1 speaks of the "<b>appropriate regulations</b>," and not merely of "guidelines and procedures" or of "supplemental guidelines" to implement the CSP. As a regulatory agency, one which is "vested with jurisdiction to regulate, administer or adjudicate matters affecting substantial rights and interests of private persons, the principal powers of which are exercised by a collective body, such as a commission, board or council,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the ERC clearly is empowered to promulgate the assailed resolution.<br><br>To be sure, in promulgating ERC Resolution No. 13, as well as ERC Resolution No. 1, the ERC acted <i>within</i> its jurisdiction.<br><br>This said, the focus of this Dissenting Opinion now shifts to whether or not the ERC, in promulgating the assailed resolution, acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>Again, the Court answers in the negative.<br><br>The term grave abuse of discretion has a specific meaning. It has been defined as the arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to the case of <i>John Dennis G.

The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an "evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>"For an act to be struck down as having been done with grave abuse of discretion, the abuse of discretion must be patent and gross."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In this instance, the ERC has sufficiently established that "restating" the effectivity of ERC Resolution No. 13 at a later date is not exercised whimsically or capriciously. Neither is it an arbitrary exercise of power by reason of passion or hostility. Indeed, its issuance is clearly not without basis. In fact, the Court finds that the ratiocination put forth by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) is reasonable to justify ERC's action.<br><br>First, the implementation of ERC Resolution No. 13 caused an avalanche of concerns and confusion from the stakeholders of the industry regarding the actual implementation of the provisions of the resolution, so much so that a multitude of DUs, mostly electric cooperatives, sought for an exemption from the guidelines in the resolution. There was a real possibility that the implementation of ERC Resolution No. 13 would invariably render nugatory the already pending negotiations among the DUs and generation companies. This fact is proven from the letters sent by SMC Global Power dated November 25, 2015 and December 14, 2015, Philippine Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Inc. dated December 1, 2015, Agusan Del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. dated December 10, 2015, Camarines Sur IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. dated December 21, 2015, and Aklan Electric Cooperative, Inc. dated March 9, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>A reading of these letters confronted the ERC with probabilities of discontinuance in the financing of projects during their implementation stage,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> aggravation of power shortages,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> confusion of ERC Resolution No. 13's applicability on PSAs already filed with the ERC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> disenfranchisement of Power Supply Contracts (PSCs) which have already been signed but were still unfiled to the ERC prior to the effectivity of ERC Resolution No. 13,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and the reality of the necessity of sufficient period within which to complete the applications which are still governed by the rules prior to ERC Resolution No. 13.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>All these concerns were presented to the ERC, which then, by its mandate, acted accordmgly. There is wisdom in the OSG's assertion that by granting a period of transition, the ERC would avoid the risk of inconsistency in resolving individual requests for exemptions sought by the DUs, generation companies, and electric cooperatives, while at the same time, it would secure the steady supply of electricity for the same period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> mistakenly characterizes ERC's "restatement" of the effectivity of Resolution No. 1 as an "amendment" to DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008. The <i>ponencia</i> stated that ERC extended the CSP's implementation twice, totaling 305 days, which should not be allowed by the Court.<br><br>But this kind of interpretation with regard to the nature of implementing rules and regulations, specifically in this case, disavows the very purpose for which implementing rules and regulations are created.<br><br>One, it is a blatant error to state that ERC Resolution No. 13 already "amended" DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 (the first "amendment" according to the <i>ponencia</i>). While it is true that DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008 took effect on June 30, 2015, <u><b>the enforcement of the CSP was not to take effect until after 120 days therefrom</b></u>. This is because Section 3 of the same circular categorically provided for a 120-day period for the promulgation of the CSP guidelines and procedures. It said:<br><blockquote><b>Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of CSP.</b> After the effectivity of this Circular, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and the DOE. In the case of ECs, the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u><b>Within one hundred twenty (120) days from the effectivity of this Circular, the ERC and DOE shall jointly issue the guidelines and procedures</b></u> for the aggregation of the un-contracted demand requirements of the DUs and the process for the recognition or accreditation of the Third Party that conducts the CSP as hereto provided. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>By promulgating Joint Resolution No. 1 and ERC Resolution No. 13 on October 20, 2015, less than 120 days from the effectivity of DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, both the DOE and ERC merely followed Section 3 thereof. There was no first "amendment" in this case as the ponencia concluded, and the Court should not rush into ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of ERC for performing its mandate.<br><br>Two, it will be absurd to require stakeholders in the energy sector to comply with a new procurement method at the very moment of the circular's promulgation when there is yet no implementing rules and regulations that would guide them on the methodologies of its implementation. In DOE Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, CSPs to be undertaken by DUs are couched in principles, rather than procedure. Section 1 states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 1. General Principles.</b> Consistent with its mandate, the DOE recognizes that Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the procurement of PSAs by the DUs ensures security and certainty of electricity prices of electric power to end-users in the long-term. Towards this end, all CSPs undertaken by the DUs shall be guided by the following principles:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Increase the transparency needed in the procurement process in order to reduce risks;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Promote and instill competition in the procurement and supply of electric power to all electricity end-users;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Ascertain least-cost outcomes that are unlikely to be challenged in the future as the political and institutional scenarios should change; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Protect the interest of the general public.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Section 3 of the same circular is not any clearer. It provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 3. Standard Features in the Conduct of CSP.</b> After the effectivity of this Circular, all DUs shall procure PSAs only through CSP conducted through a Third Party duly recognized by the ERC and the DOE. In the case of ECs, the Third Party shall also be duly recognized by the National Electrification Administration (NEA).<br><br>Under this Circular, CSPs for the procurement of PSAs of all DUs shall observe the following:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Aggregation for un-contracted demand requirements of DUs;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Annually conducted; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Uniform template for the terms and conditions in the PSA to be issued by the ERC in coordination with the DOE.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>If the enforcement of the CSP began on June 30, 2015, as was posited in the <i>ponencia</i>, how should the Third Party mentioned in the section conduct the CSP? What are the parameters? What are the required documents/uniform templates to be submitted? What are the deadlines? More to the point, who are these Third Parties? How can they be recognized by the ERC and the DOE? By the National Electrification Administration?<br><br>This is why there was wisdom in the DOE's imposition of a period prior to the enforcement of the CSP. The reasons are obvious: (a) the agency tasked to draft the implementing rules and regulations must be accorded reasonable time within which to draft the same; and (b) the same agency must balance the implementation of the new policy over the already existing ones so as to ascertain continuous and unabated service to the public.<br><br>To this end, the action of the ERC in issuing ERC Resolution No. 1, rather than subvert the intentions of EPIRA, allowed the smooth transition of one procurement method to be utilized by the Government to another new method. Thus, the "restatement" of the effectivity of the CSP in ERC Resolution No. 1 is not an "amendment" but a carefully studied enforcement of the very same mandate reposed upon the ERC.<br><br>Second, ERC did not "evade" its positive duty as provided for in the Constitution, the EPIRA, DOE Department Circular No. DC2015-06-0008, or ERC Resolution No. 13 as the petitioners would like the Court to believe. The petitioners stretch the interpretation of these laws and issuances by their insinuations that "restating" the effectivity of ERC Resolution No. 13 is already tantamount to evasion of duties.<br><br>I could not subscribe to this interpretation.<br><br>The petitioners did not convincingly show any action by the ERC that negated any provision of the Constitution, the EPIRA, or any of the resolutions mentioned. No action has been indicated to have disregarded CSP procedure. In fact, ERC Resolution No. 13, the very resolution that the petitioners assert to have been violated, has been in effect since April, 2016. As discussed earlier, the issuance of ERC Resolution No. 1 is a by-product of the concerns of the DUs, generation companies, and electric cooperatives. <u><b>The Court could not dictate upon the ERC the time upon which the effectivity of ERC Resolution No. 13 should begin. This is a policy decision that rests solely on the ERC.</b></u> This being the case, I find no illicit connection—as the petitioners have proved no illicit connections—between ERC Resolution No. 1 and the submission by the respondents of their PSAs prior to the given deadline.<br><br>If anything, what the petitioners ask of the Court is for the latter to substitute its own wisdom to that of ERC's actions as the main administrative agency clothed with expertise to decide on the effectivity of its own rules. This, the Court could not do. As has been repeatedly mentioned herein, ERC's action on merely "restating" the date of effectivity of ERC Resolution No. 13—its own resolution that has been in effect since April, 2016—has not been shown to have been promulgated with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>Third, it must also be emphasized that ERC Resolution No. 1 enjoys a strong presumption of its validity. In <i>Spouses Dacudao v. Secretary Gonzales</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Chief Justice Lucas P. Bersamin reiterated the Court's ruling in <i>ABAKADA Guro Party List (formerly AASJS), et al. v. Hon. Purisima, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> where the Court extended the presumption of validity to legislative issuances as well as to rules and regulations issued by administrative agencies. <i>ABAKADA Guro Party List</i> said:<br><blockquote>Administrative regulations enacted by administrative agencies to implement and interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce have the force of law and are entitled to respect, Such rules and regulations partake of the nature of a statute and are just as binding as if they have been written in the statute itself. As such, they have the force and effect of law and enjoy the presumption of constitutionality and legality until they are set aside with finality in an appropriate case by a competent court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>.<br></blockquote>Moreover, the ERC, being envisioned to be "a strong and purely independent regulatory body,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> is "vested with broad regulatory and monitoring functions over the Philippine electric industry to ensure its successful restructuring and modernization."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The burden of proving that the presumption of validity should be disregarded rests solely on the petitioners. For the reasons already mentioned above, I believe that the petitioners failed on this purpose. Thus, as the ERC has been "provided by the law with tools, ample wherewithal, and considerable latitude in adopting means that will ensure the accomplishment of the great objectives for which it was created [its actions should similarly be] accorded by the Court the greatest measure of presumption of regularity in its course of action and choice of means in performing its duties[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Finally, anent the petitioners' prayer to require the ERC to disapprove the PSAs already submitted before it for the private respondents' failure to conduct CSP or for the possibility of "freezing" the CSP procedure for 20 years, I believe that the Court must once again rule against the petitioners and for the respondents.<br><br>In truth, the approval or disapproval of the PSAs have heretofore been pending before the ERC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Considering that the ERC is not guilty of any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing ERC Resolution No. 1, the Court should not substitute its judgment on PSA applications which are not yet acted upon. It is worth stressing that the Court could only discharge such actions if, in approving or disapproving the PSA applications, the ERC acted (1) without or in excess of jurisdiction, or (2) with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. For the moment, such action of the ERC, if ever it would act in that manner, is still in the realm of conjecture and deserves scant consideration.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rules of Court (1997), Rule 65, Sec. 1.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rules of Court (1997), Rule 65, Sec. 2.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Umali v.
