Thereafter, Durban said that he just kept quiet and played with his mobile phone. Durban also said that it was already 11:30 a.m. and he already took his lunch.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Furthermore, in the same hearing, PO1 Pineda testified that he thought that Agbayani and Durban were only teasing each other, and that "it is normal for us that when Boy [Durban] speaks, it seems that he is shouting."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>During the final clarificatory hearing on April 23, 2015, Huervana testified that he did not see or hear the alleged altercation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In the same hearing, Leocario testified that she witnessed the alleged incident and narrated as follows:</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="center">A:</div></td> <td width="95%" valign="top"> <div align="justify">I saw Mr. Agbayani walking towards the lobby from the back exit with a piece of paper on his hand.

Thus, the OCA recommended that the matter be referred to the Executive Judge of RTC, Iloilo City for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the said matter was referred to the new Executive Judge Gloria G.

Pineda, the Police Officer assigned at the Annex Building did not give due attention to the banter between the two for he thought that they were just teasing each other and that there was no misunderstanding between the two for they were even on speaking terms. He did not notice any untoward incident as well. Another witness, Laurence Antiquiera alleged that the two were talking in a loud voice but he could not specifically recall what the argument was all about because he was six (6) meters away from them and his attention was focused on a couple looking for a certain Tessie Jamolo and that [sic] he approached the table where the alleged incident took place, whatever argument there was between the two had already ceased. Yvette Leocario, a security guard justified that she did not mind the manner by which Mr. Durban asked x x x Agbayani because they had been used to Mr. Durban's attitude where she noticed that his voice was set at a higher tone, x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>After Executive Judge Madero's Report (with the attached Report of Executive Judge Trespeces) was forwarded to the OCA, it made the following findings and recommendation in a Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated January 24, 2019: Based on the investigations and reports of Executive Judges Trespeces and Madero, the OCA found that it was not sufficiently proven that Durban "berated and threatened" Agbayani within the premises of the Hall of Justice. The witnesses (<i>i.e.</i>, Antiquiera and PO1 Pineda) "either did not know what was happening in the lobby when the incident occurred or they only thought that SO Agbayani and respondent Durban were just teasing each other and that there was no actual misunderstanding" between them. While Executive Judge Trespeces refused to believe Durban's "defense that he naturally speaks at the top of his lungs," Executive Judge Madero noted that it is "common knowledge among the employees of the Iloilo court that Durban has an unusually loud voice and the same may be interpreted differently." After an evaluation of the facts presented, the OCA concluded that, for lack of merit and evidence, the charge of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service may be dismissed. Moreover, the allegation of loafing (which means frequent absence from the work station during office hours) may also be dismissed for lack of proof that Durban committed the said act more than once.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The OCA cited <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Runes</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> where loafing is defined as "frequent unauthorized absences from duty during office hours"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and the word "frequent" connotes that the employees absent themselves from duty more than once.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> However, while the above charges may be dismissed, the OCA recommended that Durban should be sternly warned that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely by the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The Court adopts the OCA's findings and recommendation with modification.<br><br>While the Court agrees with dismissing the charges of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and loafing, the investigations revealed that Durban was in the lobby of the Hall of Justice and not in his work station during office hours. Clearly, he failed to strictly observe the prescribed working hours. As shown by the transcript of stenographic notes of the clarificatory hearing on April 8, 2015, Durban himself testified that he "was busy playing" with his mobile phone and "it was already 11:30 o'clock in the morning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> While he stated in his Affidavit (Comment) that he was in the lobby of the Hall of Justice at 10:40 a.m. after washing his mop<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and during the clarificatory hearing on May 24, 2018, he testified that he was in the ground floor at 11:00 a.m. after he "brought [sic] something from the sari-sari store outside."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It is clear from all of his statements that he was not at his work station during office hours. In <i>Roman v. Fortaleza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court reiterated the following: Court personnel must devote every moment of official time to public service; the conduct and behavior of court personnel should be characterized by a high degree of professionalism and responsibility, as they mirror the image of the court; and court personnel must strictly observe official time to inspire public respect for the justice system. In <i>Lopena v. Saloma</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court stressed that public officials and employees must observe the prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service if only to recompense the government and ultimately the people who shoulder the cost of maintaining the judiciary.<br><br>In finding that Durban failed to strictly observe the prescribed working hours, the Court also takes into consideration his advanced age, his years of service, and the fact that this is his first offense. In determining the penalty to be imposed, the Court considers the facts of the case and factors which may serve as mitigating circumstances, such as the respondent's length of service, the respondent's acknowledgment of his or her infractions and feeling of remorse, family circumstances, humanitarian and equitable considerations, and respondent's advanced age, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Thus, the Court deems it appropriate to admonish Durban.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, while the charges of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and loafing are hereby dismissed, Mr. Marion M.
