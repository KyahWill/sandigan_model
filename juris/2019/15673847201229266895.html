However, the loan amount remained unpaid which the accused is bound to pay Conpil pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement x x x. Consequently, accused is under obligation to pay complainant the sum of P500,000.00 which represents the amount of the face value of the subject check.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </blockquote>Respondent appealed the MTC's ruling on her civil liability to the RTC under Rule 122 in relation to Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.

(Andrews). In the course of the proceedings, it appeared that Andrews transferred its assets and relinquished control of its operations to Palmer Asia, Inc. (Palmer). Although Andrews stopped all operations, it was never liquidated in accordance with the Corporation Code. After trial, the MTC acquitted Gerve Magallanes (accused Magallanes) but found him civilly liable. On appeal, this finding was reversed by the RTC. Palmer (not Andrews) thus filed a Petition for Review before the CA. The CA reversed the RTC and found accused Magallanes civilly liable. The accused thus challenged Palmer's personality to file the suit before this Court. In granting the Petition, this Court categorically held:<br><blockquote>x x x The RTC Decision absolving Magallanes from civil liability has&nbsp; attained&nbsp; finality,&nbsp; since&nbsp; no appeal was&nbsp; interposed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; private complainant, Andrews. While Palmer filed a petition for review before the CA, it is not the real party in interest; it was never a party to the proceedings at the trial court.<br><br>Under our procedural rules, "<u>a case is dismissible for lack of personality to sue upon proof that the plaintiff is not the real party-in­ interest, hence grounded on failure to state a cause of action</u>." In the instant case, Magallanes filed a motion to dismiss in accordance with the Rules of Court, wherein he claimed that:<br><blockquote><u>x x x the obvious and only real party in interest in the filing and prosecution of the civil aspect impliedly instituted with x x x the filing of the foregoing Criminal Cases for B.P. 22 is Andrews International Products, Inc.</u><br><br>The alleged bounced checks issued by x x x Magallanes were issued payable in the name of Andrews International Products, Inc. The [n]arration of [facts] in the several Informations for violation of B.P. 22 filed against Magallanes solely mentioned the name of Andrews International Products, Inc.</blockquote>The real party in this case is Andrews, not Palmer. Section 2 of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Parties in interest</i>. - A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest.</blockquote>In <i>Goco v. Court of Appeals</i>, we explained that:<br><blockquote>This provision has two requirements: 1) to institute an action, the plaintiff must be the real party in interest; and 2) the action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.&nbsp; Interest within the meaning of the Rules&nbsp; of Court means material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree or judgment of the case, as distinguished from mere curiosity about the question involved. One having no material interest to protect cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court as the plaintiff in an action.</blockquote>Parties who are not the real parties in interest may be included in a suit in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 3. <i>Representatives&nbsp; as&nbsp; parties</i>.&nbsp; - Where&nbsp; the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest&nbsp; A representative may be a trustee of an express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.</blockquote>The&nbsp; CA&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in stating&nbsp; that&nbsp; Palmer&nbsp; and&nbsp; Andrews&nbsp; are&nbsp; the same entity. These are two separate and distinct entities&nbsp; claiming&nbsp; civil&nbsp; liability against&nbsp; Magallanes.&nbsp; Andrews&nbsp; was the payee of the bum checks,&nbsp; and the former employer&nbsp; of Magallanes.&nbsp; It filed the complaint&nbsp; for B.P. 22 before MeTC Branch 62. Thus when the MeTC Branch 62 ordered Magallanes to "pay the private complainant&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; face value of the checks x x x", it was referring to Andrews, not Palmer.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Given the foregoing&nbsp; facts, it is clear that the real party in interest here is Andrews. Following the Rules of Court, the action should be in the name of Andrews. As previously mentioned, Andrews instituted the action before the MeTC&nbsp; Branch 62 but it was Palmer which filed a petition for review before the CA x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; The&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; that&nbsp; initiated&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; for B.P.&nbsp; 22 is different from the corporation that t1led the memorandum at the RTC and the petition for review before the CA. It appears that Palmer is suing Magallanes in its own right, not as agent of Andrews, the real party in interest.<br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that Palmer is correct in asserting that it is the agent of Andrews, the latter should have been included in the title of the case, in accordance&nbsp; with procedural rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, there is&nbsp; no doubt&nbsp; that&nbsp; the People is the real party-in-interest in criminal proceedings. As the criminal complaint for violation of B.P. 22 was filed in the MTC, necessarily the criminal case before it was prosecuted "in the name of the People of the Philippines."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; This very basic understanding of what transpired shows ineluctably the egregious error by the CA in ruling that the Conpil should have been "included in the title of the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As discussed in <i>Magallanes</i>, the private complainant is the real party­ in-interest only as regards the civil aspect arising from the crime. A review of the records of the instant case unequivocally shows that the civil aspect of the criminal case was, in fact, appealed by respondent and that it was Conpil, being the victim of the fraud, that was the private complainant therein. This is clear from the following facts: 1) a Secretary's Certificate, which stated that the Board of Directors of Conpil resolved, at a special meeting on January 21, 2000,&nbsp; to&nbsp; initiate all&nbsp; legal action&nbsp; against&nbsp; respondent and to&nbsp; authorize its President to represent the Corporation in all civil and criminal cases against Ms. Mary Ann C. Resurreccion and to sign the Complaint, Affidavit of Complaint and all necessary pleadings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; the Affidavit of Complaint subscribed before the Office of the Prosecutor in February of 2000 concludes that the complaint affidavit was filed because "Conpil Realty Corp. has extended its generosity and kind understanding to the limit and cannot anymore extend its patience,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; and 3) both the Affidavit and the Secretary's Certificate were formally offered as evidence for the purpose of proving that Alfredo Pili was the authorized representative&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; complainant corporation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; and that he was authorized to file the instant case, adduce evidence and testify on behalf of Conpil.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; This same set of undisputed and admitted facts totally belies the CA's claim that the criminal complaint was not filed or prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>More importantly, the CA grossly erred when it faulted petitioner for not having included Conpil in the title of the petition for review under Rule 42,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> given that the criminal case was correctly titled "People of the Philippines v. Mary Ann Resurreccion" and that the title was changed by respondent when she filed her petition for review with the CA, to "<i>Mary Ann Resurreccion v. Alfredo Pili, Jr."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The egregious error becomes more manifest if one were to consider that in Paragraph 12 of the Memorandum filed by petitioner on behalf of Conpil, it expressly stated that "Conpil authorized its President x x x to file cases for violation of BP 22 x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to enforce its right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; That the CA closed its eyes to this constitutes not only gross manifest error but grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; To be sure, the whole matter was exacerbated&nbsp; when the CA senselessly&nbsp; ascribed this mistitling to petitioner and punished Conpil by dismissing the appeal and setting aside the civil liability awarded by both the MTC and the RTC without carefully reviewing the records.<br><br>But even if the Court were to prescind from the foregoing,&nbsp; the Court cannot but fault the CA for failing to follow a basic rule in the dispensation of justice: that is, "[p]leadings shall be construed liberally so as to render substantial justice to the parties and to determine speedily and inexpensively the actual merits of the controversy with the least regard to technicalities."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><i> Vlason Enterprises Corp. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; unequivocally states:<br><blockquote>The inclusion of the names of all the parties in the title of a complaint is a formal requirement&nbsp; under Section&nbsp; 3, Rule 7. <u>However, the rules of pleadings require&nbsp; courts to pierce the form and go into&nbsp; the substance,&nbsp; and not to be misled&nbsp; by a false&nbsp; or&nbsp; wrong&nbsp; name&nbsp; given&nbsp; to a pleading. The averments in the complaint, not the title, are controlling. Although&nbsp; the&nbsp; general&nbsp; rule&nbsp; requires&nbsp; the&nbsp; inclusion of the&nbsp; names of all&nbsp; the parties in the title of a complaint, the non-inclusion of one or some of them is not fatal to the cause of action of a plaintiff, provided there is a statement in the body of the petition indicating that a defendant&nbsp; was made a party to such action.</u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x In any event, we reiterate that, as a general rule, mere failure to include the name of a party in the title of a complaint is not fatal by itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </blockquote>A more assiduous review of the records would have obviated the instant appeal and more speedily and inexpensively resolved the issues to the benefit of all parties.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>,&nbsp; the Petition&nbsp; is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals' Decision dated May 22,2015 and Resolution dated January 29,2016 in CA­ G.R.
