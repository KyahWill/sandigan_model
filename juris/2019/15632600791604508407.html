These field engineers, however, are undisputedly retained by respondents.<br><br>. . . While Alvin Roselim is a forklift operator, [Wilson, Richard, and Menor] are helpers who work under the supervision of field engineers. The latter were the ones in charge of deliveries and respondents may have had reasons to terminate them on [the] ground of redundancy. As a Technical Assistant whose duties include monitoring of projects until completion, there is no substantial basis why complainant was also affected by respondents' redundancy plan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, foregoing considered, complainant is hereby found to have been illegally dismissed.

It held that Matiere SAS and Gouvary were able to establish that Acosta's position became redundant upon the completion of its contracts with the Department of Public Works and Highways and the Department of Agrarian Reform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> It added:<br><blockquote>Even assuming that Acosta's functions included reporting and coordination, he completely failed to show that these particular functions were not incidental only to the supply and delivery of the bridges. Acosta does not dispute the completion of the shipments for the covered projects. Neither did he ever dispute that the DPWH and the DAR projects were Matiere's only activities locally. It follows clearly that with the completion of the shipments, Acosta's role became unnecessary. Despite the continuation of installation and erection of the bridges, Acosta cannot pretend any involvement in such activities. His task was indubitably office- and table-bound and not field work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>Acosta moved for reconsideration, but his Motion was denied by the Court of Appeals in its July 12, 2017 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Hence, Acosta filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> against Matiere SAS and Gouvary. Maintaining that the declaration of redundancy of his position was not based on fair and reasonable criteria, petitioner pointed out that he, the most senior engineer, was dismissed while the other engineers remained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>As to the certifications from the Department of Public Works and Highways and the Department of Agrarian Reform, petitioner states that the completeness of delivery merely pertained to one (1) of his tasks as technical assistant. Thus, he claims that it was wrong to dismiss him based only on these certifications:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><blockquote>The supply contract of the Respondents could not have ended up upon completion of delivery. The supply contract satisfies only the delivery of the Supply of Bridging Material. The design, technical supervision during the erection, installation and commissioning were still ongoing and to be completed in 2016. Petitioner checks on the designs of the Design Consultants, coordinate[s] with them, evaluate[s] their billings. Such activities were still ongoing when the Petitioner was terminated.<br><br>It is important to note that contracts of the Respondents they entered with the DPWH and DAR comprise of the following:<br><ol><li>Supply of Bridging Materials.<br></li><li>Supply of Goods for the design, manufacture and delivery of modular steel unibridges.<br></li><li>Supply of Technical Advise / Services and Materials.<br></li><li>As well as variable services within the maximum provision for installation and commissioning of the Bridges.<br></li></ol>Beyond completeness of the delivery of bridging materials to the projects, other aspects of the contracts have to be accomplished. The actual approved accomplishment for the design of DAR Bridges alone as of June 2013 was only 16%, or 68 out of 418 bridges. Petitioner then was still doing the checking, coordinating with the consultants and certifying billings of Woodfields Consultants, Inc[.] and Design Sciences, Inc. He could have continued doing his assign[ed] tasks if not for his untimely and unjustified termination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> respondents insist that they sufficiently established that petitioner's position was already redundant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> They cite the certifications from the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Department of Public Works and Highways to prove that "there was a significant diminution in the volume of materials business."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Claiming that the completion of the shipments rendered petitioner's position irrelevant, they argue that he failed to prove that his other tasks were not merely incidental to his main function. Thus, they were left with no choice but to legally dismiss him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Respondents further argue that they did not dismiss petitioner in bad faith, contending that they complied with labor law requirements in terminating his employment. They point out that he was given a notice of termination with computation of his separation pay, and that the Department of Labor and Employment was also notified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Lastly, respondents claim that petitioner did not deny that the shipments for their projects were already completed. Neither did he dispute that respondent Matiere SAS' projects in the Philippines were only those with the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Department of Public Works and Highways.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not petitioner Manuel G. Acosta was validly dismissed from employment on the ground of redundancy.<br><br>Redundancy is recognized as one (1) of the authorized causes for dismissing an employee under the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Article 298 of the Labor Code provides:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 298. [283] <i>Closure of Establishment and Reduction of Personnel</i>. - The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the installation of labor-saving devices, <i>redundancy</i>, retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Wiltshire File Company, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> this Court explained:<br><blockquote>[R]edundancy, for purposes of our Labor Code, exists where the services of an employee are in excess of what is reasonably demanded by the actual requirements of the enterprise. Succinctly put, a position is redundant where it is superfluous, and superfluity of a position or positions may be the outcome of a number of factors, such as overhiring of workers, <i>decreased volume of business</i>, or dropping of a particular product line or service activity previously manufactured or undertaken by the enterprise. The employer has no legal obligation to keep in its payroll more employees than are necessary for the operation of its business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The requirements for a valid redundancy program were laid down in <i>Asian Alcohol Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><blockquote>For the implementation of a redundancy program to be valid, the employer must comply with the following requisites: (1) written notice served on both the employees and the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment; (2) payment of separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay or at least one month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; (3) good faith in abolishing the redundant positions; and (4) fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining what positions are to be declared redundant and accordingly abolished.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Assuming that respondents can declare some positions redundant due to the alleged decrease in volume of their business, they still had to comply with the above-cited requisites. This, they failed to do.<br><br>Respondents complied with the first and second requisites. There is no contention that they notified both petitioner and the Department of Labor and Employment at least a month before the planned redundancy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also received a computation of his separation pay corresponding to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service with additional payment for economic assistance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>However, as to the third and fourth requisites, this Court held that "[t]o establish good faith, the company must provide substantial proof that the services of the employees are in excess of what is required of the company, and that fair and reasonable criteria were used to determine the redundant positions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Here, respondents' only basis for declaring petitioner's position redundant was that his function, which was to monitor the delivery of supplies, became unnecessary upon completion of the shipments. However, upon careful scrutiny, this Court finds that the Employment Agreement itself contradicts respondents' allegation. Its pertinent provisions read:<br><blockquote>Dear Mr Acosta:<br><br>In connection with your position as <b>Technical Assistant</b>, please be informed that you are subject to the following terms and condition:<br><ol><li>. . . .<br><br></li><li>The Employee shall be employed in the capacity of Technical Assistant, the current duties and responsibilities of which are set out in Schedule "A" annexed hereto and forming part of this agreement. These duties and responsibilities may be amended from time to time in the sole discretion of the Employer, subject to formal notification of same being provided to the Employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Under Schedule "A," petitioner's job description listed his tasks as a technical assistant:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Prepare reports regarding WCI [Woodfields Consultants, Inc.] consultants.<br><br></li><li>Be the intermediary between the CAD operators in WCI and the management in the office.<br><br></li><li>Attend coordination meetings with consultant.<br><br></li><li>Evaluate billings.<br><br></li><li>Follow the SIT and prepare reports.<br><br></li><li>Prepare various reports as required by the resident manager.<br><br></li><li>Site visits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>There was no mention of monitoring shipments as part of petitioner's tasks. If his work pertains mainly to the delivery of supplies, it should have been specifically stated in his job description. Respondents did not even present any evidence to support their claim or to contradict petitioner's documentary evidence. There was, hence:, no basis for respondents to consider his position irrelevant when the shipments had been completed.<br><br>Likewise, respondents failed to show that they used fair and reasonable criteria in determining what positions should be declared redundant.<br><br>In <i>Panlilio v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> this Court held that fair and reasonable criteria may take into account the preferred status, efficiency, and seniority of employees to be dismissed due to redundancy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Yet, respondents never showed that they used any of these in choosing petitioner as among the employees affected by redundancy.<br><br>Although he was among the five (5) employees dismissed, petitioner cannot be similarly situated with the other employees. Roselim was a forklift operator, while Richard, Wilson, and Menor were helpers assigned to field engineers. The four (4) employees work directly with the delivery of supplies. On the other hand, as already discussed, petitioner's duty is not limited to the monitoring of deliveries. Accordingly, this Court declares petitioner to have been illegally dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>GRANTED</b>. The April 7, 2017 Decision and July 12, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Respondent Matiere SAS is ordered to pay petitioner Manuel G.
