Sometime in February 2014, respondent complained of chest pains and difficulty in breathing. On March 23, 2014, he was admitted at the Alisha Hospital in Israel for pulmonary edema and was diagnosed with "severe aortic regurgitation and aneurysm of the sinuses of valsava­ aortic root." He underwent open-heart surgery (aortic valve replacement) on March 25, 2014 and was discharged and advised to consult his personal cardiologist in the Philippines on April 13, 2014.

He was then given an impediment grade of VI (50%) and was declared unfit for sea duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On June 9, 2015, respondent filed a disability complaint against petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He claimed that he was not informed of any assessment by the company-designated physician as to his fitness for sea duty. He alleged that he had told petitioners of the findings of his own private physician but petitioners rejected or avoided his repeated requests for referral to a third doctor. Respondent sought full disability benefits (US$60,000.00), moral damages (Php1,000,000.00), exemplary damages (P200,000.00) and attorney's fees (10% of total claims).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioners countered that respondent was informed of the assessment made by the company-designated physician on July 30, 2014, at a meeting with Gilbey Jane A. Endaya and Jennifer M. Magsino, claims officers of Pandiman Philippines, Inc. (<i>Pandiman</i>) that were assigned to coordinate with the representative of petitioner Norbulk. The causes and risk factors of his illness (aortic valve stenosis) having been explained to him, respondent seemed to have understood that his ailment was not work-related and that petitioners shall continue to pay for his medical expenses until the I 30th day or up to August 27, 2014, after which his treatment would be discontinued. Respondent did not protest the assessment but only requested petitioners to shoulder the cost of his coronary angiogram, which was granted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>About five (5) months later, petitioners received a letter dated January 5, 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> from respondent's counsel stating that since respondent was not informed of the medical assessment by the company-designated physician, he obtained a second opinion from his chosen doctor, Dr. Vicaldo. Said doctor declared him "unfit to work as seaman in any capacity" with an impediment grade of 6 (50% disability). Respondent thus demanded payment of US$60,000.00 as permanent total disability benefit. After a conciliation-mediation conference before the NLRC-SENA Unit failed to settle the dispute, the proceeding was ordered closed and terminated. On April 13, 2015, petitioners again received a letter from respondent's counsel requesting referral to a third doctor for a final evaluation of respondent's disability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioners replied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to the counsel of respondent, refuting the allegation of respondent that he was not informed of the medical assessment of the company-designated physician, and also manifested their willingness to refer respondent to a third doctor for a final determination of whether his condition was work-related. On June 1, 2015, respondent's counsel sent another letter denying petitioners' assertion that respondent was duly informed of the company-designated physician's medical assessment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As per respondent's account, he was merely told that he still had to undergo an angiogram and his medical treatment would stop after 120 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further claimed that respondent's counsel even personally conferred with their own counsel on the possible terms and conditions for the appointment of a third doctor, during which the former promised to send an e-mail containing their proposal. However, instead of such e-mail, petitioners received a summons from the NLRC. Such actuations of respondent's counsel indicate his lack of genuine intention to comply with the Third-Physician Rule under the POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Labor Arbiter</u></b><br></center><br>In his Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated April 19, 2016, Labor Arbiter Thomas T. Que, Jr. (<i>LA Que</i>) said that while respondent failed to seek the opinion of the third doctor, the stipulations in the employment contract and CBA are merely permissive and not mandatory, hence the use of the word "may." Moreover, with his disability still subsisting, respondent acted within his rights in instituting the complaint against petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On the issue of whether respondent's heart ailment was work-related, LA Que opined that their liability for compensation was impliedly admitted by petitioners when they provided him with medical treatment and paid his sickness allowance. Such continued medical treatment and payment of sickness allowance was indicative of petitioners' assessment that respondent's illness did, in fact, arise in the course of and/or was aggravated by the conditions of his employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>LA Que further ruled that respondent's cardiovascular disease should be deemed accidental because not all fitters end up with such condition. This entitles respondent to the maximum amount provided in the CBA. The findings of the company-designated physician were not given credence for being ambiguous. Considering that there was no definite assessment of respondent's fitness to work and his medical conditions remained unresolved, LA Que concluded that he was already deemed totally and permanently disabled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the LA's decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding Complainant entitled to his claim for total and permanent disability benefits and attorney's fees in the respective amounts of US $95,949 and $9,594.90 and, correspondingly, holding Respondents jointly and severally liable to pay the same.<br><br>All other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><u><b>Ruling of the NLRC</b></u><br></div><br>Petitioners appealed to the NLRC, which reversed the LA's ruling in its September 28, 2016 Decision. The NLRC disagreed with the LA's finding that respondent's illness was work-related considering that he failed to present substantial evidence that would show the causal connection between his work as a fitter and his heart disease. Citing medical references, the NLRC noted that aortic valve stenosis could be caused by genetics, aging, and childhood rheumatic disease and may be aggravated by lifestyle choices. These causes being natural, the illness could not have been accidental. As to Dr. Vicaldo's findings, the NLRC pointed out that said physician did not perform any test on respondent. His recommendation was merely based on the medical examinations conducted by the company-designated physician.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The NLRC also disagreed with the LA's view that respondent's illness did not arise from an accident as provided in the CBA. Aortic Valve Stenosis is caused by natural causes and not accidental. Since respondent failed to prove that his heart disease was work-related, such illness is not compensable under the POEA-SEC and the CBA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The NLRC thus decreed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision of the Labor Arbiter Thomas T. Que, Jr. is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, the complaint is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration but the NLRC denied the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> He then elevated the case to the CA in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.<br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the CA</u></b><br></center><br>In its decision, the CA reversed the NLRC, finding respondent's illness to be work-related. The pertinent portions of the CA's discussion on respondent's entitlement to disability are herein reproduced:<br><blockquote><b>The records of this case are bereft of any showing as to how petitioner's nature of work caused or contributed to the aggravation of his illness. Nevertheless, We find that (<i>sic</i>) his illness to be work­ related</b> for two reasons. First, <b>petitioner did not exhibit any sign that he was sick when private respondents employed him</b>. Verily, petitioner's blood pressure during his PEME was at 130/80mmHg., which is considered to be higher than what experts consider optimal for most adults. Private respondents' company-designated physician opined in his certification that "stress test and 2DEcho will detect aortic stenosis in the PEME. The ECG may provide signs but not definitive." Nevertheless, petitioner's results for his chest x-ray and ECG all came out normal. As such, petitioner was declared fit for sea duty. Evidently, there were no signs that petitioner was suffering from Aortic Valve Stenosis at the time private respondents employed him. He only showed signs and symptoms of the said cardiac injury while he was performing his work on board with private respondents' vessel. Pursuant to Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC, We can therefore conclude that there is a causal relationship between petitioner's illness and the work he performed.<br><br>Second, <b>the Supreme Court took judicial notice in several cases that seafarers are exposed to harsh conditions of the sea, long hours of work and stress brought about by being away from their families</b>. Compounded to this, their bodies are further subjected to wear and tear as a consequence of their work or labor. Aside from these, it has been held in several cases that "cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and other heart ailments are work-related and, thus, compensable."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Private respondents are further mistaken in their argument that petitioner is not entitled to receive his disability compensation. It is clear from the records of this case that private respondents' company­-designated physician neither gave petitioner a disability rating nor a categorical pronouncement that he is fit to work or is permanently disabled, whether total or permanent. Nevertheless, petitioner's independent physician gave him an Impediment Grade of VI and proclaimed him to be 'unfit to resume work as seaman in any capacity.' In the landmark case of <i>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar</i>, it was held that injuries with a disability grading from 2-14 under Section 32 of the POEA-SEC may be deemed to be permanent and total if it incapacitates a seafarer from performing his usual duties for a period of more than 120 or 240 days x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Here, the company-designated physician refused to give petitioner a disability rating on the premise that his illness is not work-related.</b> Still, it was explicitly stated in the company-designated physician's certification that "maximum medical care has already been reached in this case as the patient already underwent Aortic Valve Replacement."<br><br>Conspicuously, private respondents' company-designated physician, himself, recommended petitioner to undergo Coronary Angiography because he had dilated left ventricle with severe hypokinesia. After undergoing coronary angiography, the following were found:<br><blockquote><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>The coronary angiography showed insignificant coronary artery vessels. It also showed an avanabus oitpin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary cell.<br></blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Observably, <b>private respondents' company-designated physician offered no explanation as with regard to petitioner's condition after undergoing coronary angiography</b>. Moreover, the progress report that was issued by private respondents' company-­designated physician appears to be misleading. The abovequoted progress report stated that petitioner had an "avanabus oitpin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary cell." It appears after delving into medical literature that there is no such thing as "avanabus oitpin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary cell." <b>To dispel any confusion, private respondents could have presented a copy of the results of the coronary angiography, itself, but did not.</b> Due to such failure of the private respondents, <b>there arises a presumption that such evidence, if presented, would be prejudicial to it</b>.<br><br>Assuming that private respondent's company-designated physician made a typographical error. The said progress report could be interpreted to mean that petitioner had an "anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus." Studies have shown that anomalies of this kind rarely happens. It was then found that this kind of anomaly may lead to sudden death or myocardial ischemia without exhibiting any symptoms. Nevertheless, this anomaly can be surgically treated. It was not clear, however, from the records of this case if petitioner was treated for such anomaly. Neither was there any showing that petitioner was able to work again as a fitter without putting his life in peril.<br><br>Thus, We find that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in deleting the labor arbiter's award of total and permanent disability compensation of US$60,000.00 (US$50,000,00 x 120%), in accordance with Section 32 of the 2010 POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (emphases supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated September 20, 2016 and Resolution dated October 27, 2016, both issued by the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC LAC No. 05-000379-16 are hereby <b>REVERSED</b>. The Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated 19 April 2016 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> and <b>REINSTATED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by the May 9, 2018 CA Resolution.<br><br><center><b>ISSUE</b><br></center><br>The main issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not respondent is entitled to disability compensation under the POEA-SEC and/or the CBA.<br><br><center><b><i>Petitioners' Arguments</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioners assail the CA's finding that respondent's aortic valve stenosis is work-related.<br><br>Considering that respondent failed to establish the causal relationship between his illness and the nature of his work duties, petitioners argue that the CA clearly erred in holding that he was entitled to permanent and total disability compensation. The mere fact that respondent was declared fit for sea duty prior to hiring does not prove that he acquired his disease by reason of his employment. It was thus possible that he was already suffering from a heart ailment but due to the limitations of the Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME), the examining doctor failed to detect the same. Petitioners stress that although ECG can provide signs of aortic valve stenosis, the same is not definitive according to the company-designated physician. The tests that can properly diagnose said disease is Stress Test and 2D Echo, none of which were conducted during the PEME. As to respondent's pre-hypertensive blood pressure reading, it could only mean that his heart was not in perfect shape; and yet the PEME result posted no hindrance to respondent's employment at sea or was insufficient indication for the examining doctor to require him to undergo further tests. There is certainly no basis for the CA to infer work-connection simply because respondent passed the PEME.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Petitioners deplore the CA's factual findings based only on presumptions and absent the quantum of evidence required in labor cases - which is an erroneous application of the law on compensation proceedings. In citing previous cases decided by the Court where it was pronounced that cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and other heart ailments are work-related and compensable, the CA failed to consider that the grant of benefits in those cases were based on satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 32-A(11) of the POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It is imperative for respondent to show by substantial evidence the nature of his work and the strain appurtenant thereto that may have resulted in his condition. Notably, despite the CA's recognition that the records of this case were bereft of any showing of such work connection or work aggravation, it still held petitioners liable for the payment of disability benefits to respondent. Indeed, the speculations of the CA should not be allowed to prevail over the express declaration of the company-designated physician that respondent's illness is not work­ related.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On the non-referral to a third doctor, petitioners maintain that it was the counsel of respondent who breached the rule by the precipitate filing of the complaint while they were still conferring on how to comply with the mandatory procedure. Even assuming that said rule can be set aside in the interest of substantial justice, there is still no valid basis for the award of disability benefits because Dr. Vicaldo's pronouncement of work-relation/aggravation is unsubstantiated. Said doctor issued a medical certificate to respondent after a one-time consultation without conducting diagnostic or confirmatory tests. Petitioners cite previous instances when the Court has warned the labor tribunals to take extreme caution in relying on the assessment of Dr. Vicaldo. The CA should have done what the NLRC did when it refused to give credence to the unfounded medical certificate of Dr. Vicaldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In their Reply to respondent's Comment, petitioners contend that the principle of work-aggravation cannot be appreciated in respondent's favor because he failed to prove that his work as fitter and/or the working conditions on board the vessel aggravated his ailment. Petitioners cite respondent's record of hours of rest which was attached to their position paper submitted before the Labor Arbiter. Said document showed that the average time respondent worked was only 10 hours a day between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., with one-hour break at 12 noon; and that he had sufficient 14 hours of rest each day from July to March 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br></center><br>In his Comment, respondent asserts that the CA correctly reinstated the LA's award which is in accord with the POEA-SEC, as interpreted by the Court in its recent decisions. Having been cleared as fit to work in his PEME, it is clear that respondent only suffered the illness while on board the vessel, for which he was medically repatriated. The company-designated physician did not categorically state that respondent's illness is work­-aggravated; hence, the findings of Dr. Vicaldo that his condition is work-­aggravated should prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that since petitioners did not respond to his request for referral to a third doctor, he is then deemed totally and permanently disabled in contemplation of law, as held in several cases. Further, as held in <i>Eyana v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc., et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> if the injuries with a disability grading from 2 to 14 (partial and permanent) would incapacitate a person for more than 120 or 240 days, depending on the need for further medical treatment, then the patient is deemed totally and permanently disabled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Similarly, in this case, respondent is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits, having been given a grade 6 disability rating by Dr. Vicaldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In his Rejoinder to Petitioners' Reply, respondent insists that the CA correctly held that his heart disease, though pre-existing or congenital, was work-aggravated. He also points out that the final report of the company-­designated physician was issued to Ms. Endaya and not to respondent. As to the meeting conducted by representatives of the manning agency, respondent said that, not being doctors, their statements are hearsay, and such does not sufficiently comply with the employer's obligation to issue a definite assessment of his illness and fitness to work made by the company-­designated physician.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Whether or not respondent's illness is compensable is essentially a factual issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Issues of facts may not be raised under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court because this Court is not a trier of facts.

The relevant contracts pertain to the POEA-SEC, as provided under Department Order No. 4, series of 2000 of the Department of Labor and Employment (<i>DOLE</i>), and the parties' CBA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Since respondent was hired in 2013, it is the 2010 POEA-SEC (Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Ships) under Philippine Overseas Employment Authority (<i>POEA</i>) Memorandum Circular No. 010-10 which is applicable in this case. Section 20(A) thereof governs the procedure for compensation and benefits for a work-related injury or illness suffered by a seafarer on board seagoing vessels during the term of his employment contract, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 20. <i>Compensation and Benefits.</i> -<br><br>A <i>Compensation and Benefits for Injury or Illness</i><br><br>The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers <b>work-­related injury or illness</b> during the term of his contract are as follows:<br><br>1.

If the injury or illness requires medical and/or dental treatment in a foreign port, the employer shall be liable for the full cost of such medical, serious dental, surgical and hospital treatment as well as board and lodging until the seafarer is declared fit to work or to be repatriated. However, if after repatriation, the seafarer still requires medical attention arising from said injury or illness, he shall be so provided at cost to the employer until such time he is declared fit or the degree of his disability has been established by the company-designated physician.<br><br>3. In addition to the above obligation of the employer to provide medical attention, the seafarer shall also receive sickness allowance from his employer in an amount equivalent to his basic wage computed from the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the degree of disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician. The period within which the seafarer shall be entitled to his sickness allowance shall not exceed 120 days.

Upon repatriation, his condition was diagnosed by the company-designated physician as aortic valve stenosis.<br><br>"In aortic valve stenosis, the aortic valve between the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) and the main artery that delivers blood from the heart to the body (aorta) is narrowed (stenosis). When the aortic valve is narrowed, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump a sufficient amount of blood into the aorta and onward to the rest of [the] body.

The company designated-­physician, however, refused to issue a disability grading for the reason that such illness is not work-related.<br><br>On July 21, 2014, the 93rd day from respondent's signing-off and medical repatriation, the company-designated physician, Dr. Natalio G. Alegre II, issued the following medical assessment:<br><blockquote>1. Aortic Valve Stenosis is the narrowing of the valve that conducts blood from the heart to the aorta and to the circulatory system.

The risk factors are previous infection of Rheumatic Fever, an inherited deformed heart and age.<br><br>3. Stress test and 2DEcho will detect aortic stenosis in the PEME.

If he fails to do so and the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the latter shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled. Thus, even if it was shown that given the seafarer's delicate post-operative condition, a definitive assessment by the company-designated physician would have been unnecessary as, for all intents and purposes, the seafarer was already unfit for sea duty. Still, with the said doctor's failure to issue a definite assessment of the seafarer's condition on the last day of the statutory 240-day period, the seafarer was deemed totally and permanently disabled pursuant to Article 192(c)(1) of the Labor Code and Rule X, Section 2 of the AREC.<br><br>However, it must be pointed out that in the aforecited case, respondent sufficiently alleged the causal connection between his work duties/functions and his heart disease, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Just the same, in several cases, cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, as well as other heart ailments were held to be compensable. Likewise, petitioners failed to refute respondent's allegations in his Position Paper that <b>in the performance of his duties as Able Seaman, he inhaled, was exposed to, and came into direct contact with various injurious and harmful chemicals</b>, dust, fumes/ emissions, and other irritant agents; <b>that he performed strenuous tasks</b> such as lifting, pulling, pushing and/or moving equipment and materials on board the ship; that <b>he was constantly exposed to varying temperatures of extreme hot and cold</b> as the ship crossed ocean boundaries; that he was exposed as well to harsh weather conditions; that in most instances, <b>he was required to perform overtime work</b>; and that <b>the work of an Able Seaman is both physically and mentally stressful</b>.

Thus:<br><blockquote>Moreover, degenerative changes of the spine, also known as osteoarthritis, is a listed occupational disease under Sub-Item Number 21 of Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC if the occupation involves <u><b>any</b></u> of the following:<br><br>a.

Such should be read in relation to the provisions of the POEA Standard Employment Contract which, among others, provide that an illness should be work­ related.

These rules, however, cannot be asserted perfunctorily by the claimant as it is incumbent upon him to prove, by substantial evidence, as to how and why the nature of his work and working conditions contributed to and/or aggravated his illness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote>Indeed, respondent was unable to present substantial evidence to show that his work conditions caused, or at the least increased the risk of contracting his illness.

Additionally, the CA faulted petitioners for not presenting a copy of the results of respondent's coronary angiography, which it said gave rise to the presumption that such evidence if presented would be prejudicial to petitioners. On the assumption that the company-designated physician made a typographical error in the medical report, dated August 28, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> stating that the result of the coronary angiography showed an "avanabus oitpin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary cell," the CA interpreted this to mean an anomalous origin of "the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus." Since such anomaly rarely happens, though it can be surgically treated, the CA again faulted petitioners for not treating the same and for failing to show that respondent was able to work again as a fitter without endangering his life. Incidentally, respondent was able to obtain a copy of the report on coronary angiography which was attached to the petition for certiorari filed before the CA. The cardiologist's conclusion stated: "Insignificant coronary artery disease" with the recommendation to "continue medical therapy" and "aggressive secondary prevention."<br><br>The CA's reasoning based on generalized statements and presumptions does not suffice to prove entitlement to disability compensation.
