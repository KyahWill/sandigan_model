In upholding the invalidity of the waiver and transfer of rights, this Court explained that:<br><br><blockquote>. . . lands awarded to beneficiaries under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) may not be sold, transferred or conveyed for a period of 10 years. The law enumerates four exceptions: (1) through hereditary succession; (2) to the government; (3) to the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP); or (4) to other qualified beneficiaries. In short, during the prohibitory 10-year period, any sale, transfer or conveyance of land reform rights is void, except as allowed by law, in order to prevent a circumvention of agrarian reform laws.<br><br>. . . The law expressly prohibits any sale, transfer or conveyance by farmer-beneficiaries of their land reform rights within 10 years from the grant by the DAR. The law provides for four exceptions and Lebrudo does not fall under any of the exceptions. In <i>Maylem v. Ellano,</i> we held that the waiver of rights and interests over landholdings awarded by the government is invalid for being violative of agrarian reform laws. Clearly, the waiver and transfer of rights to the lot as embodied in the Sinumpaang Salaysay executed by Loyola is void for falling under the 10-year prohibitory period specified in RA 6657.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote><br>In this case, the claimants of Lots 780-12 and 780-13 are no longer covered by the prohibition under Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended.

No. 6657 "is not merely a mistake in the designation of the mode of appeal, but clearly an erroneous appeal from the assailed Orders." For in relying solely on Section 54, petitioners patently ignored or conveniently overlooked Section 60 of R.A. No. 6657, the pertinent portion of which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>An appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals, or from any order, ruling or decision of the DAR, as the case may be, shall be by a petition for review with the Supreme Court, within a non-extendible period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of a copy of said decision. . . .<br></blockquote><br>Section 60 of R.A.

No. 7902, this Court issued Circular 1-95 dated May 16, 1995 governing appeals from all quasi-judicial bodies to the Court of Appeals by petition for review, regardless of the nature of the question raised. Said circular was incorporated in Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>Section 61 of R.A. No. 6657 clearly mandates that judicial review of DAR orders or decisions are governed by the Rules of Court. The Rules direct that it is Rule 43 that governs the procedure for judicial review of decisions, orders, or resolutions of the DAR Secretary. By pursuing a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 rather than the mandatory petition for review under Rule 43, petitioners opted for the wrong mode of appeal. Pursuant to the fourth paragraph of Supreme Court Circular No. 2-90, "an appeal taken to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals by the wrong or inappropriate mode shall be dismissed."

Where two (2) rules on the same subject, or on related subjects, are apparently in conflict with each other, they are to be reconciled by construction, so far as may be, on any fair and reasonable hypothesis. Validity and legal effect should therefore be given to both, if this can be done without destroying the evident intent and meaning of the later act.

The arrival of the Spanish introduced the concept of encomienda, or royal land grants, to loyal Spanish subjects, particularly the soldiers. Under King Philip II’s decree, the encomienderos or landowners were tasked "to maintain peace and order" within their encomiendas, to protect the large estates from external attacks, and to support the missionaries in converting the natives into Christians. In turn, the encomienderos had the right to collect tributes or taxes such as gold, pearls, cotton cloth, chickens, and rice from the natives called indios. The encomienda system helped Hispanicize the natives and extended Spanish colonial rule by pacifying the early Filipinos within the estates.<br><br>There were three (3) kinds of encomiendas: the royal encomiendas, which belonged to the King; the ecclesiastical encomiendas, which belonged to the Church; and the private encomiendas, which belonged to private individuals. The local elites were exempted from tribute-paying and labor, or <i>polo</i> services, required of the natives.<br><br>The encomienda system was abused by the encomienderos. Filipinos were made to pay tribute more than what the law required. Their animals and crops were taken without just compensation, and they were forced to work for the encomienderos.<br><br>Thus, the indios, who once freely cultivated the lands, became mere share tenants or dependent sharecroppers of the colonial landowners.<br><br>In the 1899 Malolos Constitution and true to one (1) of the principal concerns of the Philippine Revolution, then President General Emilio Aguinaldo declared "his intention to confiscate large estates, especially the so-called [f]riar lands." Unfortunately, the First Philippine Republic did not last long.<br><br>The encomienda system was a vital source of revenue and information on the natives for the Spanish crown. In the first half of the 19th century, the cash crop economy emerged after the Philippines integrated into the world market, increasing along with it the powers of the local elites, called <i>principalias</i>, and landlords.<br><br>The United States arrived later as the new colonizer. It enacted the Philippine Bill of 1902, which limited land area acquisitions into 16 hectares for private individuals and 1,024 hectares for corporations. The Land Registration Act of 1902 (Act No. 496) established a comprehensive registration of land titles called the Torrens system. This resulted in several ancestral lands being titled in the names of the settlers.<br><br>The Philippines witnessed peasant uprisings including the <i>Sakdalista</i> movement in the 1930's. During World War II, peasants and workers organizations took up arms and many identified themselves with the Hukbalahap, or <i>Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon. </i> After the Philippine Independence in 1946, the problems of land tenure remained and worsened in some parts of the country. The Hukbalahaps continued the peasant uprisings in the 1950s.<br><br>To address the farmers' unrest, the government began initiating various land reform programs, roughly divided into three (3) stages.<br><br>The first stage was the share tenancy system under then President Ramon Magsaysay (1953-1957). In a share tenancy agreement, the landholder provided the land while the tenant provided the labor for agricultural production. The produce would then be divided between the parties in proportion to their respective contributions. On August 30, 1954, Congress passed Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act), ensuring the "equitable division of the produce and [the] income derived from the land[.]"<br><br>Compulsory land registration was also established under the Magsaysay Administration. Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act) granted the Land Tenure Administration the power to purchase or expropriate large tenanted rice and corn lands for resale to <i>bona fide </i>tenants or occupants who owned less than six (6) hectares of land. However, Section 6 (2) of Republic Act No. 1400 set unreasonable retention limits at 300 hectares for individuals and 600 hectares for corporations, rendering President Magsaysay's efforts to redistribute lands futile.<br><br>On August 8, 1963, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code) and abolished the share tenancy system, declaring it to be against public policy. The second stage of land reform, the agricultural leasehold system, thus began under President Diosdado Macapagal (1961-1965).<br><br>Under the agricultural leasehold system, the landowner, lessor, usufructuary, or legal possessor furnished his or her landholding, while another person cultivated it until the leasehold relation was extinguished. The landowner had the right to collect lease rental from the agricultural lessee, while the lessee had the right to a homelot and to be indemnified for his or her labor if the property was surrendered to the landowner or if the lessee was ejected from the landholding.<br><br>Republic Act No. 3844 also sought to provide economic family-­sized farms to landless citizens of the Philippines especially to qualified farmers. The landowners were allowed to retain as much as 75 hectares of their landholdings. Those lands in excess of 75 hectares could be expropriated by the government.<br><br>The system finally transitioned from agricultural leasehold to one of full ownership under President Ferdinand E. Marcos (1965-1986). On September 10, 1971, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 6389 or the Code of Agrarian Reform.<br><br>Republic Act No. 6389 automatically converted share tenancy into agricultural leasehold. It also established the Department of Agrarian Reform as the implementing agency for the government's agrarian reform program. Presidential Decree No. 2 proclaimed the whole country as a land reform area.<br><br>On October 21, 1972, Presidential Decree No. 27, or the Tenants Emancipation Decree, superseded Republic Act No. 3844. Seeking to "emancipat[e] the tiller of the soil from his bondage," Presidential Decree No. 27 mandated the compulsory acquisition of private lands to be distributed to tenant-farmers. From 75 hectares under Republic Act No. 3844, Presidential Decree No. 27 reduced the landowner's retention area to a maximum of seven (7) hectares of land.<br><br>Presidential Decree No. 27 implemented the Operation Land Transfer Program to cover tenanted rice or corn lands. According to <i>Daez v. Court of Appeals,</i> "the requisites for coverage under the [Operation Land Transfer] program are the following: (1) the land must be devoted to rice or corn crops; and (2) there must be a system of share-crop or lease-tenancy obtaining therein."<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Following the People Power Revolution, then President Corazon C. Aquino (1986-1992) fulfilled the promise of land ownership for the tenant­ farmers. Proclamation No. 131 instituted the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. Executive Order No. 129 (1987) reorganized the Department of Agrarian Reform and expanded it in power and operation. Executive Order No. 228 (1987) declared the full ownership of the land to qualified farmer beneficiaries under Presidential Decree No. 27.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>On June 10, 1988, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, to supersede Presidential Decree No. 27.<br><br>The compulsory land acquisition scheme under Republic Act No. 6657 empowers the government to acquire private agricultural lands for distribution to tenant-farmers.

The State shall apply the principles of agrarian reform or stewardship, whenever applicable in accordance with law, in the disposition or utilization of other natural resources, including lands of the public domain under lease or concession suitable to agriculture, subject to prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers, and the rights of indigenous communities to their ancestral lands.<br><br>The State may resettle landless farmers and farmworkers in its own agricultural estates which shall be distributed to them in the manner provided by law.<br><br>SECTION 7.

Section 2 lists among the objectives of agrarian reform "the just distribution of all agricultural lands" subject to certain conditions.

Among the arguments raised was that Proclamation NO. 1520 effectively reclassified and converted the use of the lands in Maragondon and Ternate in Cavite and Nasugbu in Batangas from agricultural to non-agricultural. This Court rejected the argument and ruled that Proclamation No. 1520 merely identified areas that had potential tourism value:<br><br><blockquote>Roxas &amp; Co. contends that PP 1520 declared the three municipalities as each constituting a tourism zone, reclassified all lands therein to tourism and, therefore, converted their use to non-agricultural purposes.<br><br>To determine the chief intent of PP 1520, reference to the "whereas clauses" is in order. By and large, a reference to the congressional deliberation records would provide guidance in dissecting the intent of legislation. But since PP 1520 emanated from the legislative powers of then President Marcos during martial rule, reference to the whereas clauses cannot be dispensed with.<br><br><i>The perambulatory clauses of PP 1520 identified only "certain areas in the sector compromising the [three Municipalities that] have potential tourism value" and mandated the conduct of "necessary studies" and the segregation of "specific geographic areas" to achieve its purpose. Which is why the PP directed the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) to identify what those potential tourism areas are. If all the lands in those tourism zones were to be wholly converted to non-agricultural use, there would have been no need for the PP to direct the PTA to identify what those "specific geographic areas" are.</i><br><br>The Court had in fact passed upon a similar matter before. Thus in <i>DAR v. Franco</i>, it pronounced:<br><br><blockquote>Thus, the DAR Regional Office VII<i>, in coordination with the Philippine Tourism Authority, has to determine precisely which areas are for tourism development</i> and excluded from the Operation Land Transfer and the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. And suffice it to state here that the Court has repeatedly ruled that lands already classified as non-agricultural before the eneactment of RA 6657 on 15 June 1988 do not need any conversion clearance. . . .<br></blockquote><br>While the above pronouncement in Franco is an <i>obiter</i>, it should not be ignored in the resolution of the present petitions since it reflects a more rational and just interpretation of PP 1520. There is no prohibition in embracing the rationale of an <i>obiter dictum</i> in settling controversies, or in considering related proclamations establishing tourism zones.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>According to <i>Roxas</i>, Proclamation No. 1520 neither reclassified nor converted all lands in the Maragondon, Ternate, and Nasugbu from agricultural to non-agricultural. Thus, these areas were deemed not to have been automatically excluded from the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.<br><br>This Court further held that the Department of Agrarian Reform has primary jurisdiction over applications for conversion and, as an administrative body with special competence, it has the power to determine whether a parcel of land should be included in the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:<br><br><blockquote>In the above-cited case of <i>Roxas &amp; Co v.

The DAR, an administrative body of special competence, denied, by Order of October 22, 2001, the application for CARP exemption of Roxas &amp; Co., it finding that PP 1520 did <i>not</i> automatically reclassify all the lands in the affected municipalities from their original uses. It appears that the PTA had not yet, at that time, identified the "specific geographic areas" for tourism development and had no pending tourism development projects in the areas. Further, report from the Center for Land Use Policy Planning and Implementation (CLUPPI) indicated that the areas were planted with sugar cane and other crops.<br><br>Relatedly, the DAR, by Memorandum Circular No. 7, Series of 2004, came up with clarificatory guidelines and therein decreed that<br><br><blockquote>A….<br><br>B.

To reiterate, <u>PP 1520  merely  recognized  the  "potential  tourism  value"  of  certain  areas within the general area declared as tourism zones</u>. It did not reclassify the areas to non-agricultural use.<br><br>Apart from PP 1520, there are similarly worded proclamations declaring the whole of Ilocos Norte and Bataan Provinces, Camiguin, Puerto Prinsesa, Siquijor, Panglao Island, parts of Cebu City and Municipalities of Argao and Dalaguete in Cebu Province as tourism zones.<br><br>Indubitably, these proclamations, particularly those pertaining to the Provinces of Ilocos Norte and Bataan, did not intend to reclassify all agricultural lands into non-agricultural lands in one fell swoop. The Court takes notice of how the agrarian reform program was — and still is — implemented in these provinces since there are lands that do not have any tourism potential and are more appropriate for agricultural utilization.<br><br>Relatedly, a reference to the <i>Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 </i>provides a parallel orientation on the issue. Under said Act, several towns and cities encompassing the whole Philippines were readily identified as economic zones. To uphold Roxas &amp; Co.'s reading of PP 1520 would see a total reclassification of practically all the agricultural lands in the country to non-agricultural use. Propitiously, the legislature had the foresight to include a bailout provision in Section 31 of said Act for land conversion. The same cannot be said of PP 1520, despite the existence of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 27 or the <i>Tenant Emancipation Decree,</i> which is the precursor of the CARP.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Given these martial law-era decrees and considering the socio-political backdrop at the time PP 1520 was issued in 1975, it is inconceivable that PP 1520, as well as other similarly worded proclamations which are completely silent on the aspect of reclassification of the lands in those tourism zones, would nullify the gains already then achieved by PD 27.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, in this case, there is no merit in Fil-Estate's argument that, in light of Proclamation No. 1520, the 10 lots are excluded from the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.<br><br>In addition, the Certifications<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> issued by the Philippine Tourism Authority attached to the Petition merely reiterate the provisions of Proclamation No. 1520.

Rule 137, Section 1 of the Rules of Court outlines these instances:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Disqualification of judges.</i> — No judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor or otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the record.<br><br>A judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than those mentioned above.<br></blockquote><br>The first paragraph pertains to compulsory disqualification or inhibition where it is conclusively presumed that a judge's partiality and objectivity might be questioned due to his or her relationship or interest. In <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>Judge De la Peña:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The rule on compulsory disqualification of a judge to hear a case where, as in the instant case, the respondent judge is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity rests on the salutary principle that no judge should preside in a case in which he is not wholly free, disinterested, impartial and independent. A judge has both the duty of rendering a just decision and the duty of doing it in a manner completely free from suspicion as to its fairness and as to his integrity. The law conclusively presumes that a judge cannot objectively or impartially sit in such a case and, for that reason, prohibits him and strikes at his authority to hear and decide it, in the absence of written consent of all parties concerned. The purpose is to preserve the people's faith and confidence in the courts of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The second paragraph of Rule 137, Section 1 refers to voluntary inhibition. Unlike the first paragraph, which enumerates specific cases where a judge should inhibit, the rule on voluntary inhibition gives judges the discretion to determine whether they should sit in a case for "just and valid reasons, with only. their conscience as guide."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> Broad as it may seem, the rule on voluntary inhibition "does not give judges the unfettered discretion to decide whether to desist from hearing a case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> There must be a just and valid cause or reason. An imputation of bias or partiality will not suffice absent any showing of "acts or conduct clearly indicative of arbitrariness or prejudice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup><br><br>Here, this Court finds no reason for Court of Appeals Associate Justice Gonzales-Sison to inhibit from sitting in CA-G.R. SP No. 111965.<br><br>Del Mundo, et al. simply accused her of bias and partiality for having penned two (2) cases involving the same subject matter as their Petition. This is insufficient; there must be evidence of acts or conduct indicative of the charges. In <i>Pagoda Philippines, Inc., v.
