Both parties agreed that Vicentico's pre-existing debt of P30,000.00 should be considered as the consideration for the Deed of Adjudication and Sale.

Accordingly, We uphold the validity of the Deed of Adjudication and Sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, the RTC ruled that the DAS "showed that the consequent sale of the lot in question was by way of constructive delivery x x x [and] the defendant-appellant took possession of the property right after the execution of the Deed of Adjudication.

But, it disagreed with the MTC's ruling that it is null and void. The MTC reasoned out as follows:<br><blockquote>By the testimonies of plaintiffs that no money or consideration was ever paid to them by defendant despite repeated demands and coupled with the presentation [by] plaintiffs of the Promissory Note (Exhibit "E") and the Acknowledgment of Debt (Exhibit "F") all of which was executed by the defendant Norma Moises Palma, the burden of proof x x x now has shifted on the shoulder of the defendant to prove that she paid the consideration of the sale of Lot No. 2159-A, because the plaintiffs categorically testified and told this Court that they did not receive even a single centavo from the defendant x x x much so that the defendant never rebutted such testimony of plaintiffs. Likewise, the execution of defendant of the Promissory Note (Exhibit "E") which expressly points to Lot No. 2159-A as the subject of sale between plaintiffs and defendant, will add to the belief of this Court that indeed no consideration was given to plaintiffs, because it is very unnatural for defendant to still execute a Promissory Note (Exhibit "E"), whose amount of Fifty Thousand (Php50,000.00) pesos is even greater than the amount of Thirty Thousand (Php30,000.00) pesos as reflected in the Deed of Adjudication and Sale (Exhibit "D"), had she already paid the latter amount to plaintiffs.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In short, [the defendant failed to render proof that she paid the purchase price of lot No. 2159-A, because, as] the burden of proof had already shifted [upon her] to prove she [had] paid the [consideration], she failed to introduce [any evidence that would tend] to prove [the payment of the purchase price.] x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>Having ruled that no consideration was ever given to plaintiffs (herein petitioners) by defendant (Norma), the DAS was considered by the MTC as null and void on the ground that a contract of sale is void and produces no effect whatsoever where the price, which appears thereon paid, has in fact never been paid by the vendee to the vendor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The following documentary exhibits adduced and admitted are crucial in the resolution of the first issue:<br><br>1.

Compromise Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> dated September 7, 2006 executed by Alden and Norma in connection with Civil Case No. 499, wherein they agreed as follows:<br><blockquote>1. As settlement, the private defendant [Norma] undertakes to pay the amount of Eighty Eight Thousand Pesos (Php88,000.00) Philippine Currency as payment for the purchase of the 85.8 square meters undivided portion of Lot 2159-A, which amount shall be delivered on or before January 31, 2007;<br><br>2. The plaintiff [Alden], in return, shall respect defendant's ownership and possession over the same. He further waives and renounce (<i>sic</i>) his interest over Lot 2159-A in favor of defendant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>It can be gathered from the last paragraph of the DAS wherein the Real Estate Mortgage (REM) which Vicentico executed was "cancell[ed] and considered null and void and no effect" that a dation in payment might have been intended by the parties therein. Under Article 1245 of the Civil Code, there is dation in payment when property is alienated to the creditor in satisfaction of a debt in money and is governed by the law of sales.<br><br>This scheme was affirmed by Laceriano N. Moises (Laceriano), the brother of Norma, who testified on direct examination that his uncle Vicentico together with his wife mortgaged Lot 2159-A, the subject lot, to his mother Rosita for the amount of P30,000.00 and the source of the amount came from his younger sister Norma,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and that since no payment was made regarding the P30,000.00, Vicentico and Placida offset the subject lot for their indebtedness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>While the DAS seems to suggest a dation in payment, the subsequent actuations of the parties, especially Norma, negate the same or the contemplated offset. If the DAS was intended to be a dation in payment, the execution of the PN and AOD by Norma as well as the Compromise Agreement by Alden and Norma on September 7, 2006, whereby Alden agreed, for an agreed consideration, to respect Norma's ownership and possession of 85.8 square meters of the subject lot, the share being claimed by him, shows an opposite declaration, <i>i.e.</i>, there was no dation in payment or offset.<br><br>If the intention by the parties was that the heirs of Vicentico were ceding the subject lot to Norma as payment of the P30,000.00 loan of their father to Rosita, it would be out of the ordinary for Norma to execute a PN two days after the DAS, acknowledging her indebtedness of the P50,000.00 to them, promising to pay the same within a specified period, and declaring against her interest that the said amount represented the "cost" of the land that she bought from them. Subsequently, in 2007, it would be unlikely for her to execute the AOD wherein she acknowledged that she owed Karen, Warren and Lynette P50,000.00 if the consideration of the DAS was Vicentico's indebtedness of P30,000.00. Alden was no longer included because by then Norma had already paid the P88,000.00 which she agreed to pay him pursuant to their Compromise Agreement. And, Norma should have insisted in the case filed by Alden against her that there was an offset of his father's loan to her, through Rosita, her mother.<br><br>Moreover, in the AARM, a duly notarized document which the heirs of Rosita executed in July 2005, they acknowledged that: "[they] are releasing this Real Estate Mortgage, the fact being that the late Vicentico Nuñez had already paid [their] late mother indebtedness of THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P30,000.00) [and] absolving the late Vicentico Nuñez of any liabilities whatsoever."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Indeed, as claimed by petitioners in the Petition, the P30,000.00 loan of their father Vicentico had been paid as duly acknowledged in a registered public instrument by the heirs of Rosita, including Norma.<br><br>Thus, there is preponderant evidence that supports the finding that the DAS was <u><b>not</b></u> intended by the parties to be a dation in payment. And, even assuming that the DAS was a dation in payment, the documents that were subsequently executed had the effect of novating the same.<br><br>Under Article 1291 of the Civil Code, obligations may be modified by: (1) changing their object or principal conditions; (2) substituting the person of the debtor; and (3) subrogating a third person in the rights of the creditor.<br><br>When Norma executed the PN, AOD and Compromise Agreement, she was acknowledging that the principal condition or stipulation on the payment of the purchase price in the DAS had been modified from the offset or cancellation of Vicentico's indebtedness secured by the REM, without which would have amounted to a dation in payment, to a loan payable within a certain period, which converted the transaction to a sale on credit.<br><br>Given the foregoing, the CA erred in its finding that the transaction between the parties is a dation in payment or <i>dacion en pago</i>. The MTC and RTC were, therefore, correct in considering the transaction as a contract of sale.<br><br>A contract of sale is defined in Article 1458 of the Civil Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>ART. 1458. By the contract of sale, one of the contracting parties obligates himself to transfer the ownership of and to deliver a determinate thing, and the other to pay therefor a price certain in money or its equivalent.<br><br>A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.<br></blockquote>The Court in <i>Sps. Ramos v. Sps. Heruela</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (<i>Ramos</i>) differentiated an absolute sale from a conditional sale as follows:<br><blockquote>Article 1458 of the Civil Code provides that a contract of sale may be absolute or conditional. A contract of sale is absolute when title to the property passes to the vendee upon delivery of the thing sold.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> A deed of sale is absolute when there is no stipulation in the contract that title to the property remains with the seller until full payment of the purchase price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The sale is also absolute if there is no stipulation giving the vendor the right to cancel unilaterally the contract the moment the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In a conditional sale, as in a contract to sell, ownership remains with the vendor and does not pass to the vendee until full payment of the purchase price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The full payment of the purchase price partakes of a suspensive condition, and non-fulfillment of the condition prevents the obligation to sell from arising.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>Pursuant to <i>Ramos</i>, the DAS is an absolute sale because there is no stipulation in the contract that title to the property remains with the sellers until full payment of the purchase price and there is no stipulation giving the vendors the right to cancel unilaterally the contract the moment the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period. It will be recalled that after the execution of the DAS, Norma immediately took possession of the subject lot<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and there was no retention of ownership by the heirs of Vicentico until full payment of the purchase price by Norma that was stipulated in the DAS.<br><br>What then is the legal effect of the non-payment of the purchase price of P50,000.00<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> by Norma to petitioners?<br><br>Pursuant to Article 1458 of the Civil Code, a contract of sale is a reciprocal obligation to give; and the prestation or obligation of the seller or vendor is "to transfer the ownership of and to deliver a determinate thing" while the prestation or obligation of the buyer or vendee is "to pay therefor a price certain in money or its equivalent." The full payment of the purchase price is the buyer's prestation.<br><br>The non-payment of the purchase price by the buyer after the seller has delivered the object of the sale to the buyer constitutes a breach of the buyer's prestation in a contract of sale. The buyer has contravened the very tenor of the contract.<br><br>Generally, under Article 1594 of the Civil Code, "[a]ctions for breach of the contract of sale of goods shall be governed particularly by the provisions of this Chapter [Chapter 6 on 'Actions for Breach of Contract of Sale of Goods'], and as to matters not specifically provided for herein, by other applicable provisions of this Title [Title VI on 'Sales']."<br><br>One remedy is provided in Article 1595, to wit:<br><blockquote>ART. 1595. Where, under a contract of sale, the ownership of the goods has passed to the buyer, and he wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay for the goods according to the terms of the contract of sale, the seller may maintain an action against him for the price of the goods.<br></blockquote>In addition, the buyer may be held liable for damages under Article 1596, to wit:<br><blockquote>ART. 1596. Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may maintain an action against him for damages for nonacceptance.<br><br>The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the buyer's breach of contract.<br></blockquote>Also, an unpaid seller, who is deemed as such "[w]hen the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered" as provided in Article 1525(1), has the right to rescind the sale under Article 1526.<br><br>With respect to the sale of immovable properties, the remedies of the vendor are provided in the following Civil Code provisions:<br><blockquote>ART. 1591. Should the vendor have reasonable grounds to fear the loss of immovable property sold and its price, he may immediately sue for the rescission of the sale:<br><br>Should such ground not exist, the provisions of Article 1191 shall be observed.<br><br>ART. 1592. In the sale of immovable property, even though it may have been stipulated that upon failure to pay the price at the time agreed upon the rescission of the contract shall of right take place, the vendee may pay, even after the expiration of the period, as long as no demand for rescission of the contract has been made upon him either judicially or by a notarial act. After the demand, the court may not grant him a new term.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ART. 2242.

This right is expressly recognized by the first paragraph of Art. 1165 of the Code which states that the creditor may compel the debtor to make the delivery. x x x<br><br>(2) To recover damages for breach of the obligation. Besides the right to compel specific performance, the creditor has also the right to recover damages from the debtor in case of breach of the obligation through delay, fraud, negligence or contravention of the tenor thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>With respect to reciprocal obligations, rescission or more appropriately resolution is another remedy pursuant to Article 1191 of the Civil Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>ART. 1191. The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<br><br>The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case.

The most salient feature of this obligation is reciprocity. In order that there be reciprocity, it is not sufficient that two persons be mutually debtor and creditor of each other; the reciprocity must be so perfect as to cause both relations to arise from the same source; each obligation being correlative with the other, it not being possible to conceive one without the other. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>In a contract of sale, as in the DAS in this case, the obligation of the vendee to pay the price is a correlative of the obligation of the vendor to deliver the thing sold.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Proceeding from the fact that the obligation of one party is the correlative of the obligation of the other in reciprocal obligations, the Civil Code in the first paragraph of Article 1191 has established the principle that if one of the parties fails to comply with what is incumbent upon him, there is a right on the part of the other to rescind (or "resolve" in accordance with accepted translations of the Spanish Civil Code) the obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Since this condition, which is implied as a general rule in all reciprocal obligations, has the effect of extinguishing rights which are already acquired or vested, it is resolutory in character, thus a tacit resolutory condition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In the words of Justice Eduardo P. Caguioa, "Article 1191 provides for the implied or tacit resolutory condition even if there is no corresponding agreement between the parties," unlike in unilateral obligations where the right to resolve the obligation must always be express.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> He further opined that although the said Article uses the term "rescind" the same should be understood in the sense of "resolve"; and distinguished the two terms as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x Between the two terms, there are several differences: (1) resolution can only be availed of by a party to the obligation while rescission may be availed of by a third person (creditor); (2) resolution can be obtained only on the ground of non-performance by the other party while rescission may be based on fraud, lesion, etc.; (3) resolution may be refused by the court on valid grounds while rescission may not be refused by the court if all requisites are present; (4) resolution is a primary remedy while rescission is subsidiary, available only when there is no other remedy; and (5) resolution is based on mutuality of the parties while rescission is based on prejudice or damage suffered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>To summarize, the remedies of the unpaid seller, after ownership of the real property not covered by Republic Act No. 6552<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> or the Maceda Law, has been vested to the buyer, are:<br><br>1. To compel specific performance by filing an action against the buyer for the agreed purchase price; or<br><br>2.&nbsp; To rescind or resolve the contract of sale either judicially or t|y a notarial act; and<br><br>3. In either (1) or (2), to recover damages for the breach of the contract.<br><br>Based on the amended complaint, petitioners seek to declare the DAS null and void <i>ab initio</i> and non-existent since Norma, the vendee, did not pay the purchase price to them pursuant to the doctrine that where the price which appears in the contract of sale to have been paid but has in fact not or never been paid, the contract is void; and the absence of Alden's signature in the DAS showed that he did not sign the same and it lacked his consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> The DAS being null and void, TCT T-35460 that was issued in the name of Norma should be cancelled; the ownership of the subject lot should be reconveyed to the heirs of Vicentico; and possession thereof should be delivered to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Since the cause of action of Alden had been finally and fully settled in the Compromise Agreement in Civil Case No. 499, he no longer has a cause of action against Norma with respect to his <i>pro indiviso</i> right in the subject lot.<br><br>What is clear from the amended complaint is that the remedy of specific performance was not availed of by petitioners. They do not seek to collect from Norma the purchase price of P50,000.00. While they have not expressly sought the resolution of the DAS on account of Norma's non­payment of the purchase price, such remedy could be implied when they sought the nullification of Norma's TCT, the reconveyance to them of the subject lot and the return of the possession to them. When the remedy of resolution of reciprocal obligations, as in rescission, is sought, "the obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract, together with their fruits, and the price with its interests" is created pursuant to Article 1385 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Aside from attorney's fees, litigation expenses, moral damages and exemplary damages, they also seek from Norma in their amended complaint the "reasonable value of the use of the premises in the estimated amount of at least P10,000.00 a year, the property in question being a prime commercial lot," having been deprived thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>As to the ruling of the MTC, it erred when it concluded that the DAS could be considered as not consummated because no consideration was effected or given by Norma; and, thus, it is void and non-existent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The sale was partly consummated on account of the transfer of ownership by the vendors to Norma. The DAS is not void for lack of consideration, but it has been extinguished by the happening of the tacit resolutory condition, which is judicial resolution or rescission of the sale.<br><br>Likewise, the RTC erred in ruling that the DAS is valid, notwithstanding the non-payment of the consideration, because there was delivery pursuant to Article 1477<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> in relation to Article 1498<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> It further erred when it ordered Norma to pay the P50,000.00 with interest at the legal rate of 12% per annum starting on June 28, 1995 (DAS' date of execution) until the full amount is paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The error is because, firstly, the remedy availed of by the vendors is not specific performance, and secondly, under Article 1592 of the Civil Code, the court may not grant the buyer a new term when a demand for rescission of the contract has been made upon him judicially.<br><br>The applicability of Article 1592 was discussed by the Court in <i>Cabrera v. Ysaac</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><blockquote>For the sale of immovable property, the following provision governs its rescission:<br><blockquote>Article 1592. In the sale of immovable property, even though it may have been stipulated that upon failure to pay the price at the time agreed upon the rescission of the contract shall of right take place, the vendee may pay, even after the expiration of the period, as long as no demand for rescission of the contract has been made upon him either judicially or by notarial act. After the demand, the court may not grant him a new term.<br></blockquote>This provision contemplates (1) a <i>contract of sale</i> of an immovable property and (2) a stipulation in the contract that failure to pay the price at the time agreed upon will cause the rescission of the contract. The vendee or the buyer can still pay even after the time agreed upon, if the agreement between the parties has these requisites. This right of the vendee to pay ceases when the vendor or the seller demands the rescission of the contract judicially or extrajudicially. In case of an extrajudicial demand to rescind the contract, it should be notarized.<br><br>Hence, this provision does not apply if it is not a contract of sale of an immovable property and merely a <i>contract to sell</i> an immovable property. A contract to sell is "where the ownership or title is retained by the seller and is not to pass until the full payment of the price, such payment being a positive suspensive condition and failure of which is not a breach, casual or serious, but simply an event that prevented the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding force."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court is mindful of the opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes in the consolidated cases of <i>Sing, Yee &amp; Cuan, Inc. v. Santos, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> and <i>Santos, et al. v. Sing Yee &amp; Cuan, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> (<i>Sing, Yee &amp; Cuan, Inc.</i>), <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x [I]t is nevertheless clear that a distinction must be made between a contract of sale in which title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the thing sold and a contract to sell (or of "exclusive right and privilege to purchase," as in this case) where by agreement the ownership is reserved in the seller and is not to pass until the full payment of the purchase price is made. In the first case, nonpayment of the price is a negative resolutory condition; in the second place, full payment is a positive suspensive condition. Being contraries, their effect in law can not be identical. In the first case, the vendor has lost and can not recover the ownership of the land sold until and unless the contract of sale is itself resolved and set aside. In the second case, however, the title remains in the vendor if the vendee does not comply with the condition precedent of making payment at the time specified in the contract. Hence, when the seller, because of noncompliance with the suspensive condition stipulated, seeks to eject the buyer from the land object of the agreement, said vendor is enforcing the contract and is not resolving the same. That article 1504 [(of the Civil Code of Spain or old Civil Code, now Article 1592 of the new Civil Code)] refers to nonpayment as a resolutory condition and does not contemplate an agreement to sell in which title is reserved by the vendor until the vendee has complied first with conditions specified, is clear from its terms:<br><blockquote>"ART. 1504. In the sale of real property, even though it may have been stipulated that in default of the payment of the price within the time agreed upon, the resolution of the contract shall take place <i>ipso jure</i>, the purchaser may pay even after the expiration of the period, at any time before demand has been made upon him either by suit or by notarial act. After such demand has been made the judge cannot grant him further time."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Based on Justice J.B.L. Reyes' opinion in <i>Sing, Yee &amp; Cuan, Inc.</i> that the non-payment of the purchase price in a contract of sale is a negative resolutory condition, the happening or fulfillment thereof will extinguish the obligation or the sale pursuant to Article 1231 of the Civil Code, which provides that fulfillment of a resolutory condition is another cause of extinguishment of obligations. Despite its extinguishment, since the vendor has lost ownership of the land, the contract must itself be resolved and set aside. It is noted, however, that the resolution of the sale is the tacit resolutory condition under Article 1191, as discussed above, which is implied in reciprocal obligations.<br><br>Consequently, the Court rules that the sale transaction in the DAS is deemed resolved.<br><br>Proceeding to the second issue, the MTC justified the award of damages in this wise:<br><blockquote>It is an elementary rule that when a person causes injury to another by reason of a breach of contract or by a wrongful act or negligent act or omission, the person injured can recover damages for the injury he sustained from the one who causes it and that the damages he may receive will be commensurate to the injuries he sustained.<br><br>It was testified to by the plaintiffs, particularly Karen Nuñez Vito and Lynette Nuñez Macinda, that due to the non-payment of defendant Norma Moises Palma of the purchase price of their property (Lot No. 2159-A) despite their demands and the transfer of the defendant in her name the certificate of title over the subject property, it causes them sleepless nights, serious anxiety and other sufferings because, they said, they might lose their property to defendant for nothing. The plaintiff further testified that they had no other choice but to protect their rights and hired the services of a lawyer for thirty thousand (Php30,000.00) pesos.<br><br>It is already ruled by this Court that defendant Norma Moises Palma never paid plaintiffs the purchase price of Lot No. 2159-A and as such, her action caused breached (sic) of faith, which lead to the nullification of the Deed of Adjudication and Sale. Defendant's action indeed caused apprehension to plaintiffs that their property will go to waste considering that defendant had already registered and acquired in her name a Transfer Certificate of Title. The worry of plaintiffs are real and justice and equity dictates that moral damages be given to them just to alleviate and or (sic) compensate their moral sufferings caused by the action of defendant Norma Moises Palma. Likewise, the attitude of defendant, despite the lapse of twelve (12) years from the time the Deed of Adjudication and Sale was executed (June 28, 1995) by the plaintiffs up to the time of the filing of this case which was on August 15, 2007, in not paying plaintiffs, shows that defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent and even oppressive manner which this Court will not countenance and therefore so as to give an example to similarly minded persons, the award for exemplary damages is proper.<br><br>Plaintiffs action in filing a case against defendant was borne out of fear that they may lose their property. They were forced to litigate and incurred expenses to protect their rights, hence, an award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses is just and equitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br></blockquote>The non-payment of the entire purchase price, despite repeated assurances by Norma to pay the same clearly constitutes a substantial and fundamental breach as would defeat the very object of the parties in making the agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>In contracts, the court may award exemplary damages if the defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner pursuant to Article 2232 of the Civil Code. Under Article 2219, moral damages may be recovered with respect to acts and actions referred to in Article 21: "Any person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage." As provided in Article 2208, as to attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, they cannot be recovered in the absence of stipulation, except: when the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to incur expenses to protect his interest; where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiffs plainly valid, just and demandable claim; and in any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered. In all cases, they must be reasonable.<br><br>The MTC Decision has adequately explained the award of damages and the Court is in full agreement based on the statutory bases afore-cited.<br><br>The Court is aware that while petitioners alleged the amount of at least P10,000.00 a year as reasonable value of the use of the premises in the amended complaint,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> no evidence was adduced by them to support such claim. Nonetheless, the Court deems it just and equitable to award reasonable compensation in the amount as alleged by petitioners for the use and occupation of the premises by Norma because petitioners have been unjustly deprived of the use of the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> They are entitled to recover possession of the subject lot because of the failure of Norma to pay the agreed purchase price and she has not been paying any rental for her use and occupancy of the premises. Under Article 1596, the measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the buyer's breach of contract for refusing to pay the purchase price.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
