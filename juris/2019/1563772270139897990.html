Appellant approached PO2 Esteves and asked, "<i>Ikaw ba yon</i>?" and the latter nodded his head in affirmation. When the appellant understood that PO2 Esteves was buying P500.00-worth of <i>shabu</i>, appellant took one heat-sealed, transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance from his right pocket and gave it to PO2 Esteves. PO2 Esteves, in turn, handed appellant the P500.00-marked money. Once the exchange was completed, PO2 Esteves scratched his head, the pre-arranged signal that the transaction had already been consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The other members of the buy-bust team immediately rushed to the scene. PO2 Rommel R. Dulay (PO2 Dulay) placed appellant under arrest and informed him of his constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> PO2 Esteves then conducted a body search of appellant in the presence of Brgy. Captain Alberto Valdez and Brgy. Secretary Daniel Sison. From appellant's right pocket were taken three (3) transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substances.

Manuel), the subject specimens tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, more commonly known as <i>shabu</i>.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant raised the defenses of <i>frame-up</i> and <i>denial</i>. He testified that:<br><blockquote>On 17 February 2012, at around 8:30 o'clock in the evening, [appellant] was on his way home to Rosario, La Union. While waiting for a minibus in Damorits [sic], La Union, he was confronted by the policemen of Rosario saying in Ilocano[,] "<i>Shabu, adda shabum dita</i>?" (you have a [sic] shabu in your possession.) He told them that [there was nothing in his pockets or his hands]. The police officers[,] however[,] insisted on putting their hands in his pocket to see if there [was] something inside. When they did not get anything from his pocket[s], one policeman handed a crumpled piece of paper and put it inside his pocket. He was brought near the church of Damortis and in front of a store. They waited for barangay officials of the place. When they arrived, they brought out the crumpled piece of paper and opened it and saw money and a sachet of drugs. He told them to release him but to no avail, thus, he was brought to the Municipal Hall in Rosario.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Joint Decision dated November 13, 2013, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It held that the prosecution was able to prove the elements of the illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>As the designated poseur-buyer, PO2 Esteves was unwavering in his positive identification of [appellant] during the trial as the person who sold the illegal drugs. He never faltered in his testimony when he said he used the marked money as payment for the object of the crime, that is, the <i>shabu</i> which [appellant] handed to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Ostentatiously, the owner and possessor of the transparent plastic sachets [was] no other than [appellant] himself, "who [had] neither shown any proof of the absence of <i>animus possidendi</i> nor presented any evidence that would show that he was duly authorized by law to possess them during the buy-bust operation, thus leading to no other conclusion than that [appellant] [was] equally liable for illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant as follows: (<i>a</i>) to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 in Criminal Case No. A-6134; and (<i>b</i>) to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to twenty (20) years, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P300,000.00 in Criminal Case No. A-6135.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>The CA affirmed the RTC's Joint Decision but it <i>modified</i> the period of imprisonment originally imposed by the trial court in <b>Criminal Case No. A-6135</b> to an indeterminate period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as maximum, considering that the total weight of the <i>shabu</i> found in appellant's possession was only 0.3102 gram.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Like the RTC, the CA found that all the elements of the illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs were satisfactorily established by the prosecution, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In the present case, all the elements of the crime have been sufficiently established. The prosecution's evidence positively identified PO2 Esteves as the buyer and [appellant] as the seller of <i>shabu</i>. The prosecution established through testimony and evidence the object of the sale, one (1) heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance and one (1) marked Php500.00 bill, as the consideration thereof. Finally, the delivery of the <i>shabu</i> sold and its payment were clearly testified to by the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the case at bench, the prosecution was able to establish with moral certainty the guilt of [appellant] for the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. [Appellant] was apprehended, indicted, and convicted by way of a buy-bust operation, a form of entrapment to capture lawbreakers in the execution of their criminal plan. The arresting officer, PO2 Esteves, positively identified [appellant] as the person caught in actual possession of three (3) plastic sachets of <i>shabu</i> presented in court. He stated that the <i>shabu</i> were validly confiscated from the person of [appellant] during a body search conducted on him after the latter was arrested in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu</i> to PO2 Esteves during the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA rejected appellant's contention that the chain of custody over the seized items was broken as there were no representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ) when said items were inventoried and photographed. It explained that:<br><blockquote>x x x Here, the records reveal that the police officers substantially complied with the process of preserving the integrity of the seized drugs. As explained by PO2 Esteves, despite their efforts to coordinate with the media and the DOJ, no representatives were able to appear during the inventory. Considering the possible perils that any delay might entail[,] coupled [with] the fact that there was a heavy downpour at that time, it would [have been] illogical to waste precious time waiting for other representatives to arrive at the scene of the operation[,] especially since there were already <i>barangay</i> officials present to witness the event. Indeed, the presence of these officials during the inventory was already substantial compliance with the requirements of R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, whether his guilt had been proven beyond reasonable doubt, given the "serious and inexplicable discrepancies" in the testimony of PO2 Esteves as regards the important details surrounding the buy-bust operation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, whether the chain of custody over the seized items had been sufficiently established despite the prosecution's failure to present the testimony of the duty officer who received the specimens at the Regional Crime Laboratory;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>And <b><i>third</i></b>, whether the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized dangerous drugs had been compromised, considering the absence of representatives from the media and the DOJ during the conduct of inventory and taking of photographs of the confiscated items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br>"In a prosecution for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, such as <i>shabu</i>, the following elements must be duly established: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In other words, the prosecution must not only adduce proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, but must also present the seized dangerous drugs as evidence in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As regards the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must prove the following elements: (1) the accused was in possession of dangerous drugs; (2) such possession was not authorized by law; and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, both the RTC and the CA correctly found that all the elements of the crimes charged were present, as the records clearly showed that: <b><i>first</i></b>, appellant was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> selling one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i> to PO2 Esteves, the poseur-buyer, for the amount of P500.00<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> during a legitimate buy-bust operation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and <b><i>second</i></b>, three (3) other heat-sealed, plastic sachets containing <i>shabu</i> with an aggregate weight of 0.3102 gram<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> were recovered from appellant during the search made incidental to his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Absent any indication that both courts had <i>overlooked, misunderstood</i> or <i>misconstrued</i> the real import or significance of the facts and circumstances adduced in these cases, we find no reason to overturn their factual findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> After all, "the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>We further hold that the buy-bust team had sufficiently complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br>The record shows that PO2 Esteves immediately placed the markings "AS-1 02-17-2012 to AS-4 02-17-2012" on the four (4) heat-sealed, transparent plastic sachets containing suspected <i>shabu</i> that were seized during the buy-bust operation against appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The buy-bust team then conducted the physical inventory and photograph-taking of said items while still at the scene, in the presence of Brgy.

Manuel, coupled with the Chain of Custody Form<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> on record.<br><br>With regard to the absence of representatives from the media and the DOJ during the conduct of the physical inventory and photograph-taking of the seized <i>shabu</i>, we are of the view that <i>earnest efforts</i> to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses had been sufficiently proven by the prosecution.<br><br>In <i>People v. Sipin</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we explained that in cases where the presence of the required witnesses was not obtained, the prosecution must allege and prove that their absence was due to reason/s such as:<br><blockquote>x x x (1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove[d] futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, PO2 Esteves testified that no representatives from the media and the DOJ were available despite their best efforts to contact them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He further declared that there was heavy downpour at the time and they were only able to stay at the crime scene for an hour to quickly conduct the physical inventory and photograph-taking of the seized items before proceeding to the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> We find these explanations credible, as there appears to be a genuine and sufficient attempt to comply with the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In conclusion, we affirm appellant's conviction for the crimes charged. The penalty for the unauthorized sale of <i>shabu</i> under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, regardless of the quantity and purity, is life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00. Thus, the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 imposed by the court <i>a quo</i> in Criminal Case No. A-6134 is within the range provided by law.<br><br>However, we deem it proper to modify the penalty in Criminal Case No. A-6135 in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence. The penalty for the illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> with a quantity of less than five (5) grams, as in this case, is imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, we <i>reduce</i> the maximum period of imprisonment imposed on appellant from fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months to fourteen (14) years in Criminal Case No. A-6135.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
