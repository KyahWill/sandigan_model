In affirming the respect accorded to the exercise by administrative agencies of discretion whenever reference to brand names and the consequential resort to negotiated purchase are made, the Court, in the precedent setting pronouncement in National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) vs. COA, G.R. No. 114864, December 6, 1996, 265 SCRA 390, declared in categorical manner that the judgment of the government agency concerned regarding the suitability of the product, given the nature of its services, should be accorded respect even if there could have been substitute items. </p> <p>Equally decisive and of similar tenor is the implication of the Court's declaration in Baylon vs. Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan, G.R.

They further claim that she certified the documents supporting the disbursement vouchers even when they were not proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> <p> The issues for this Court's resolution are:</p> <p> First, whether or not the necessary conditions for direct contracting were met in the disallowed transactions;</p> <p> Second, whether or not the principle of <em>quantum meruit</em> applies here; and </p> <p>Finally, whether or not petitioner Villanueva can be held liable for disallowed transactions in which she has not been shown to have participated. </p> <p>This Court denies the Petition in G.R.

No. 213324. </p> <p align="center"><b>I</b> </p> <p>Petitioners failed to show that the Commission on Audit committed grave abuse of discretion in disallowing the expenditures covered by the Notice of Disallowance. </p> <p>The Commission on Audit based its disallowance on: (1) the purchases being accomplished without public bidding, in violation of Section 10 of Republic Act No. 9184; and (2) reference to brand names being made to invoke an exception to the competitive bidding requirement, in violation of Section 18 of Republic Act No. 9184.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p> <p> Petitioners Governor Lazaro, <i>et al</i>. cite <i>National Center for Mental Health Management v.

They point out that this Court accorded respect to administrative agencies' exercise of discretion whenever reference to brand names and the consequential resort to negotiated purchases were made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In that case, this Court laid exceptions to the prohibition against references to brand names under Republic Act No. 9184. Further, the Certifications/Justifications of the Therapeutics Committees, which are responsible for determining the drugs to be procured by government hospitals, explained the choice of the brand names.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p> <p>Petitioners Governor Lazaro, et al. point out that in <i>National Center for Mental Health Management</i>, this Court found that while there could have been substitute items, the procuring entity's judgment on the suitability of the brand of the items procured should be accorded respect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p> <p>What petitioners Governor Lazaro, et al. fail to mention is that <i>National Center for Mental Health Management</i> was decided in 1996, before Republic Act No. 9184 was enacted in 2003. Exceptions to the prohibition against reference to brand names in Republic Act No. 9184 could not have been laid out years before the statute's enactment.</p> <p>The law is patently clear, with no exceptions: "[r]eference to brand names shall not be allowed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Without basis to claim that it was proper to refer to brand names in their procurement, the claim that this case is an exception to the requirement of competitive bidding has no leg to stand on. Consequently, the transactions were properly disallowed.</p> <p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p> <p>When asserting their limited or absence of liability based on the principles of <em>quantum meruit</em> and good faith, petitioners, in good diligence, must clearly allege and support the factual basis for their claims. It is not this Court's burden to construe petitioners' incomplete submissions and vague narrations to determine if their assertions have merit. </p> <p>On the basis of <em>quantum meruit</em>, petitioners claim that even if the transactions were properly disallowed, they should not be required to reimburse the disallowed amounts. This is because all the medical items procured were delivered in good condition and distributed to the provincial and health centers. They were used by the intended beneficiaries of the health program. Petitioners cite <em>Royal Trust Construction</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <em>EPG Construction Co</em>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> <em>Dr. Eslao v. The Commission on Audit</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and <em>Melchor v. Commission on Audit</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> to support their position.</p> <p> <em>Royal Trust Construction, EPG Construction Co.</em>, and <em>Eslao</em> are not squarely applicable here. All three (3) cases involved the question of whether payment should be made to the contractor who had already provided the services covered by a disallowed transaction. They did not tackle the liability of public officials responsible for irregular transactions. </p><p> Indeed, the principle of <em>quantum meruit</em>—that a party is allowed to recover as much as he or she reasonably deserves<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>—is usually invoked with regard to paying a contractor for works rendered. Here, however, the contractors have already been paid, and the question to be resolved is whether the public officers responsible for the irregularity must reimburse the government for it. </p><p><em>Melchor</em> is more relevant than the rest here, as it pertained to the liability of a public officer for disallowed transactions. Nonetheless, it is still not entirely on all fours with this case. <em>Melchor</em> involved two (2) amounts that were disallowed: (1) P344,340.88, when the Commission on Audit found that the legal requirements for the contract had not been met; and (2) an additional P172,003.26, supposedly for extra work on the same project, when the Commission on Audit found that there had been no supplemental agreement executed for this additional amount. </p><p> In <i>Melchor</i>, this Court reversed the disallowance for the amount of P344,340.88, because the requirements for the contract on the project had substantially been complied with as far as that amount was concerned. However, this Court determined it proper to declare the contract for extra works as void since there was no approval by the proper authority on the additional amount. Thus, disallowing the amount of P172,003.26 had basis. Despite the disallowance, this Court held that the petitioner's liability for the entire amount of P172,003.26 should not be considered automatic. This Court recognized that while the principle of <em>quantum meruit</em> is generally contemplated for unpaid contractors, it also applied to the public officer in that case. It directed the Commission on Audit to compute the value of the extra works under <em>quantum meruit</em>, and hold the public officer liable for the excess or improper payment for the extra works, if any. </p><p>Although this Court in <em>Melchor</em> recognized the possibility of applying the principle of <em>quantum meruit</em> when considering a public officer's liability, it must be stressed that it was not used to completely absolve this liability. Rather, the principle was used to determine whether the contractor had been paid beyond the amount deserved based on <em>quantum meruit</em>, such that the public officer there was liable only for the amount that was paid beyond the reasonable amount deserved by the contractor. Even more significant, before it applied the principle of <em>quantum meruit</em>, this Court had determined that the requirements for the validity of the main contract of P344,340.88 had already been met. This is not the case here. </p><p>Here, no part of the disallowed transaction could be deemed valid. Petitioners plainly violated the law requiring procurement to undergo competitive bidding. In doing so, they also violated the law prohibiting reference to brand names. </p><p>Moreover, even if the principle of <em>quantum meruit</em> could be applied here, petitioners fail to establish the factual basis for its application. In <em>Melchor</em>, to determine a public officer's liability based on <em>quantum meruit</em>, the amount of reasonable value of the procured items or services must first be established, so that the public officer is liable for only the excess paid beyond the reasonable value. </p><p>Here, petitioners were held liable for the disallowed purchase of medical items amounting to P118,039,493.46. They do not, however, provide any basis to determine what were purchased. Thus, there is no basis to determine the reasonable value for the items purchased. </p><p> This Court cannot accept the position that the entire P118,039,493.46 was the reasonable value for the items purchased. </p><p>Petitioners enumerated neither the items purchased without public bidding nor the suppliers for these items. Just to form an idea of what were purchased and their values, this Court had to rely on the available documents submitted. </p><p>Petitioners attached some Purchase Requests to the Petition.<sup

The Purchase Requests also refer to generic items such as basic trash bags.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Notably, some of them do not seem to refer to branded items.

A case in point is the purchase of "Biogesic" brand of Paracetamol 500 mg. acquired by the agency at the price of P2.34 per piece. The market is flooded with many brands of paracetamol. Based on the Philhealth's Drug Price Reference Index (DPRI), a listing of prices of selected number of essential drugs developed to promote drug price transparency, rational and fair drug pricing, and rational use according to the DOH and Philhealth, such could be available at prices from P1 to P4. Another case is the purchase of Amoxicillin, 500 mg brand "Himox" which the agency purchased at P13.305 per capsule. Amoxicillin 500 mg can be purchased at the cost of range of P5 to P10 per capsule. Another case, is the purchase of Mefenamic acid, 500 mg. purchased by the Provincial Government of Laguna from an exclusive distributor at P14.29 per tablet which again according to DPRI could be acquired at the range of P5 to P7 per tablet.

Contrary to her claims, petitioner Villanueva failed to meticulously inspect all the documents submitted to her to ensure that the circumstances she was certifying were indeed true and correct.</p> <p> Indeed, petitioner Villanueva is liable for her failure to exercise due diligence in the performance of her duties as Provincial Accountant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> However, petitioner Villanueva has repeatedly pointed out that she was designated as Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Provincial Accountant only on July 5, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Prior to this, she was not a signatory to any document related to disbursements and purchases made by the Provincial Government of Laguna.
