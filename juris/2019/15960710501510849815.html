NEBATO (who posed as buyer) METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (Shabu), weighing 1.0248 grams, without the corresponding license or prescription therefore, and knowing the same to be such. </p> <p> Contrary to Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p> On arraignment, appellants pleaded not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial ensued. </p><p> Special Investigator 2 Laura P. Nebato, Investigating Officer 1 Nazarion Bongkinki, Investigating Agent 3 Liwanag B. Sandaan, and Forensic Chemist Chris Israel Cabatic testified for the prosecution. On the other hand, Posos, Grezola, and the latter's husband Elorde Grezola testified for the defense. </p><p> <i>Version of the Prosecution</i> </p><p> On September 5, 2011, around 10 o'clock in the morning, IA3 Sandaan received a report from a confidential informant that alias "Rolly" was involved in illegal drug activities in Barangay Camarin, Caloocan City. The confidential informant told her he could introduce one of her men to "Rolly" and they could order a bag of illegal drugs from "Rolly."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> IA3 Sandaan directed SI2 Nebato to transact with Posos. Later, SI2 Nebato reported she was able to order twenty-five (25) grams of <i>shabu</i> from Rolly for a consideration of One Hundred Forty Thousand Pesos (P140,000.00). Rolly instructed them to meet him in Barangay Camarin, Caloocan City on the following day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> They subsequently learned that Rolly's real name is Efren Morfe Posos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> The next day, or on September 6, 2011, IA3 Sandaan formed a buy-­bust team composed of the confidential informant, SI2 Nebato as poseur buyer, IO1 Bongkinki as arresting officer, and IA3 Sandaan, IO1 Diongco, IO1 Paglucauan, and SI2 Almarinos, as back-up.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> Around 2 o'clock in the afternoon of September 6, 2011, the buy-bust team proceeded to Barangay Camarin, Caloocan City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> SI2 Nebato and the confidential informant went straight to Grezola's store on Vanguard Street, where Posos instructed them to wait. Meantime, the backup team strategically positioned themselves nearby and waited for the pre-arranged signal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> A few minutes later, Posos and Grezola approached SI2 Nebato's vehicle. SI2 Nebato and the confidential informant invited appellants inside the vehicle. The confidential informant introduced SI2 Nebato as buyer to Posos and Grezola. Posos, on the other hand introduced Grezola as the wife of the owner of the drugs to be bought by SI2 Nebato. After an exchange of pleasantries, SI2 Nebato asked for the drugs from Posos. Thereupon, Posos withdrew from his pocket a small plastic sachet. He told SI2 Nebato and the confidential informant to try its contents first, as a sampler. SI2 Nebato, however, insisted for Posos to give them the whole bulk. But Posos insisted on first trying a sampler. When they still refused, Posos got irritated and started throwing invectives at them. Posos also blurted "<i>magulo kayo kausap</i>." To ease the tension, SI2 Nebato agreed to buy the small sachet worth One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> Posos thus, handed him the small plastic sachet. In turn, SI2 Nebato turned the hazard light to signify that the sale had been consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On signal, the back-up team immediately closed in. IO1 Bongkinki arrested appellants while SI2 Nebato held on to the small plastic sachet given by Posos, which she slid and kept in her sling bag. Thereafter, IA3 Sandaan instructed the team to go back to their office because a crowd was already starting to gather around them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> The buy-bust team took appellants and the seized item to their office in Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> There, the team coordinated with the barangay officials to witness the inventory. When Kagawad Jose Ruiz arrived after a few hours, the team conducted a physical inventory of the item and took photographs of appellants with the seized item and the buy-bust money. The team prepared a request for laboratory examination of the contents of the small plastic sachet and request for drug test on appellants. SI2 Nebato took appellants and the plastic sachet to the crime laboratory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Forensic Chemist Cabatic received the plastic sachet and appellants' urine sample.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Per Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DD011-334, Forensic Chemist Cabatic found the specimen positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> The prosecution offered the following exhibits: "A" to "A-1" - Request for Laboratory Examination dated, September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> "B" to "B-1" - Request for Drug Test dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> "C" to "C-1-A" - the seized small plastic sachet and its contents enclosed in a bigger brown envelope; "D"- Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DD011-334 dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> "E" - Chemistry Report No. 'PDEA-DT011-332 to PDEA-DT011-333 dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> "F" to "F-4" -photographs of the buy-bust money;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> "G" to "G-2" - Inventory of Seized Properties/Items dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> "H" to "H-7" - photographs;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> "J" - Acknowledgement Receipt dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> "K" and "K-3"- SI2 Nebato's Affidavit dated September 7, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> "L" to "L-1" - Physical Examination dated September 7, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> "M"- IO1 Bongkinki's Affidavit Reports dated September 7, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> "N" to "O" - Booking Sheets and Arrest Reports dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "P" to "P-1" - Request for Physical Examination dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> "Q" - Authority to Operate dated September 6, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and "R" to "R-1" - Pre-Operation Report dated September 6, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> </p><p> <i>Version of the Defense</i></p><p> Defense witnesses Posos, Grezola, and Elorde Grezola testified that: </p><p> Salam, an agent of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), introduced Posos to SI2 Nebato.

Grezola was taken to the Quezon City Memorial Circle where they waited for her husband. When her husband did not show up, Grezola was brought to the PDEA office where she saw Posos again.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> At the PDEA office, they learned they were being charged with violation of RA 9165.

In fact, the supposed payment remained in his possession. In <b><i>People v. Hilario, et al.,</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court emphasized that all the stages of the sale must be duly established, thus</p> <blockquote> <p>In <i>People v. Doria</i>, we stressed the <i>"objective" test</i> in buy-bust operations. We ruled that in such operations, <b>the prosecution must present a <i>complete picture</i> detailing the transaction, which "must start from the initial contact</b> between the poseur-buyer and the pusher, the offer to purchase, the promise or <b>payment of the consideration</b> until the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the illegal drug subject of the sale. We emphasized that the manner by which the initial contact was made, the offer to purchase the drug, <b>the payment of the 'buy-bust' money</b>, and the delivery of the illegal drug <b>must be the subject of strict scrutiny by courts</b> to <i>insure that law-abiding citizens are not unlawfully induced to commit an offense</i>." (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p>There being no "delivery of the payment," to speak of, appellant cannot be convicted of illegal sale of dangerous drugs. </p> <p> But this is not all. </p><p> <b>Chain of Custody</b> </p><p> In illegal drugs cases, the drug itself constitutes the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense. The prosecution is, therefore, tasked to establish that the substance illegally possessed by the accused is the same substance presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> Again, Posos and Grezola allegedly committed illegal sale of dangerous drugs on September 6, 2011. The applicable law is RA 9165 before its amendment in 2014. </p><p> Section 21 of RA 9165 prescribes the standard in preserving the <i>corpus delicti</i> in illegal drug cases, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p><b>SEC. 21.</b> Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner: </p> </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> <ol start="1"><li> The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same <b>in the presence of the accused</b> or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized or his/her representative or counsel, <b>a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (Emphasis supplied) </li></ol> </blockquote> <p align="center">xxx xxx xxx </p><p>The IRR of RA 9165 further commands: </p><p> </p><center> xxx xxx xxx </center> <p> </p><blockquote> <b>Section 21.</b> (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: x x x <u>Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under</u> j<b>ustifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items;</b> (Emphasis supplied) <p> </p></blockquote> <center> xxx xxx xxx </center> <p> To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody. <b><i>People v. Gayoso</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> enumerates the <b>links </b>in the chain of custody that must be shown for the successful prosecution of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, <i>i.e. <b><i>first</i></b>,</i> the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <b><i>second</i></b>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <b><i>third</i></b>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and <i><b>fourth</b></i>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.</p><p> This is the chain of custody rule. It came to fore due to the unique characteristics of illegal drugs which render them indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration, or substitution either by accident or otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> The <b><i>first link</i></b> speaks of seizure and marking which should be done immediately at the place of arrest and seizure. It also includes the physical inventory and taking of photograph of the seized or confiscated items which should be done in the presence of the accused, a media representative, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official. </p><p> Here, SI2 Nebato testified: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">After you received the items from the male accused, what did you do with it?

The apprehending or seizing officer having initial custody and control of the seized or confiscated dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, instruments/ paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, mark, inventory and photograph the same in the following manner: </blockquote> <p> </p><center> xxx xxx xxx </center> <p> </p><blockquote> A.1.3. In warrantless seizures, the marking of the seized items in the presence of the violator shall be done immediately at the place where the drugs were seized or at the nearest police station or nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable. The physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted in the same nearest police station or nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable. </blockquote> <p> The arresting officers here were justified when they conducted the marking at the police station since a crowd had already begun milling around the place of arrest. In <b><i>People v. Arciaga</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the Court held that for the same security reason, the buy-bust team was justified in conducting the marking, inventory, and photograph of the seized items at the PDEA-RO 7 Office instead of at the place of arrest. </p><p> This notwithstanding, however, the first link in the chain of custody was still violated. During the inventory of the seized item at the PDEA office at Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City, only Kagawad Ruiz, an elected public official, was present. There were no representatives from both the media and the DOJ. </p><p> The arresting officers did not give any reason for this procedural lapse. All IO1 Bongkinki said was: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Now, with regard to this Kagawad, is he a regular witness of your office whenever there is a buy bust operation and you are conducting investigation and photographing of the evidence?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir, because he is just near our office. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Why did you not secure the presence of the representative from the media and the DOJ?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That was the only available witness during that time, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Notably the buy-bust team received the confidential information and planned the buy-bust on September 5, 2011, a day prior to the actual buy-bust operation. Thus, the team actually had ample time to secure the presence of representatives from the media and DOJ. But it did not.</p> <p> The Court has repeatedly held that the required witnesses must be present even as early as the time of arrest. <b><i>People v. Escaran</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> is apropos: </p><blockquote> <p>x x x It bears emphasis that the presence of the required witnesses at the time of the apprehension and inventory is mandatory, and that the law imposes the said requirement because their presence serves an essential purpose. In<i> People v. Tomawis</i>, the Court elucidated on the purpose of the law in mandating the presence of the required witnesses as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p>The presence of the witnesses from the DOJ, media, and from public elective office is necessary to protect against the possibility of planting, contamination, or loss of the seized drug. Using the language of the Court in <i>People v. Mendoza</i>, without the<b><i> insulating presence</i></b> of the representative from the media or the DOJ and any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the subject sachet that was evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused. </p> <p>The presence of the three witnesses must be secured not only during the inventory but more importantly <b><u>at the time of the warrantless arrest</u></b>. It is at this point in which the presence of the three witnesses is most needed, as it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would belie any doubt as to the source, identity, and integrity of the seized drug. If the buy-bust operation is legitimately conducted, the presence of the insulating witnesses would also controvert the usual defense of frame-up as the witnesses would be to able testify that the buy bust operation and inventory of the seized drugs were done in their presence in accordance with Section 21 of RA 9165. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <blockquote><blockquote> <p> <b>The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so - and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished - does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs.</b> </p><p> To restate, <b>the presence of the three witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with at the time of the warrantless arrest; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation"</b>. (Emphasis supplied) </p></blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In <b><i>People v. Seguiente</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court acquitted the accused because there was no showing at all that a representative from the DOJ was present during the inventory and photograph. </p><p> In <b><i>People v. Rojas</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court similarly acquitted the accused because the presence of representatives from the DOJ and the media was not obtained despite the fact that the buy-bust operation on the accused was supposedly pre-planned. The prosecution, too, did not acknowledge, let alone, explain this deficiency. </p><p> Recently, in <b><i>People v. Vistro</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Court acquitted the accused in light of the arresting team's non-compliance with the three-witness rule during the physical inventory and photograph of dangerous drugs. </p><p> Next, the<b><i> second link</i></b> pertains to the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Here, SI2 Nebato herself testified that she did not turn over the seized item to an investigating officer, <i>viz</i>: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Madam Witness, to whom did you turn over the person of the accused as well as the evidence allegedly obtained from the accused again?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">They were submitted to our laboratory services, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">So, in this case, there (was) no investigator assigned or were you also the investigator assigned in this case? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">There was no investigator assigned, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">So, you acted as the investigator and you were the one who conducted the inventory, you were the one who prepared the request letter for the specimen to be referred to the Chemist, you were the one who prepared the referral letter for the case to be referred to the Fiscal's Office?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, ma'am.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The <b><i>third link</i></b> pertains to the turnover by the investigating officer to the forensic chemist of the illegal drug for laboratory examination. Here, the Request for Laboratory Examination dated September 6, 2011<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> shows that SI2 Nebato delivered the alleged seized item to the crime laboratory and was received by Forensic Chemist Cabatic. But, aside from SI2 Nebato's bare allegation that she remained in possession of the alleged item, there was no showing how the same was truly handled after the inventory and while in transit.</p> <p> In <b><i>People v. Gayoso</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court acquitted appellant therein because of the absence of proof on how the seized drug was handled during the second and third links. The Court ruled that considering these intervening gaps, it cannot be reasonably concluded that the confiscated item was the same one presented for laboratory examination and eventually presented in court. So must it be.</p><p> Lastly, the <b><i>fourth link</i></b> pertains to the turnover and submission of the seized item from the forensic chemist to the court. Here, after Forensic Chemist Cabatic examined the specimen, she claimed to have returned the same to the evidence custodian. It was not shown, however, how the evidence custodian handled and stored the seized item before the same was retrieved for presentation in court. In fact, Forensic Chemist Cabatic said that he had no more personal knowledge as to how the item was handled after he turned it over to the evidence custodian.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> This indubitably is another breach of the chain of custody rule. </p><p> In the landmark case of <b><i>Mallillin v. People</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court pronounced: </p><blockquote> <p>As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. <b>It would include testimony about every link in the chain</b>, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence, <b>in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. </b>These witnesses would then describe the <b>precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change</b> in the condition of the item <b>and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <b><i>People v. Año</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court decreed that if the chain of custody had not been complied with, or no justifiable reason exists for its non-compliance, then it is the Court's duty to overturn the verdict of conviction. </p><p> Indeed, the multiple violations of the Chain of custody rule here cast serious uncertainty on the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. The metaphorical chain did not link at all, albeit, it unjustly restrained appellants' right to liberty. Verily, therefore, a verdict of acquittal is in order. </p><p> As for Thelma Grezola, while she is not a party to this appeal and the Court of Appeals had already issued a Partial Entry of Judgment insofar as she is concerned, she may still benefit from this verdict of acquittal, in accordance with Section 11, Rule 122 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, <i>viz</i>: </p><p> </p><blockquote> <p>Section 11.
