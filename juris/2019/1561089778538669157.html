The Details of Discrepancies issued by the BIR enumerated the following findings, to wit:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote>a. The foundation may be a non-stock entity but it is definitely <u>a profit-oriented organization wherein majority of its revenue-operating activities are generating huge amount of profit amounting to P643 million</u> that earned from expensive tuition fees collected from its students, mostly belong to a [sic] upper class family.<br><br>b. The foundation's Cash in Bank in the amount of P775 million comprise of investing activities and has significant movement in relation to its charitable purposes, which mean that the foundation are [sic] not giving sufficient donations which is the main reasons [sic] for its qualification[s] [sic] for exemption. During the school year the foundations [sic] has a <u>total cash receipts of approximately 1.222 Billion out of which only 77 Million goes to the revolving fund</u>.<br><br>c. Based on the Cash Flow of the foundation activities the taxpayer has used <u>583 Million for operating activities, 54 Million interest/settlement of loan and 203 Million for investing activities or 70% of foundation's earnings goes to the administrative purposes</u> and improvement of the school to increase number of its enrollees and increase further its profit and not to further its charitable purposes.<br><br>Pursuant to section 30 of the NIRC, "Notwithstanding the provisions in the preceding Paragraphs, the income of whatever kind and character of the foregoing organizations from any of their properties, real or personal, or from any of their activities conducted for profit [r]egardless of the disposition made by such income, shall be subject to tax imposed under this Code."<br><br>d. The taxpayer's Ruling for exemption from the BIR was obtained in 1988, hence, all Ruling issued before the implementations or RA No. 8424 or CTRP was repealed, thereby, requiring the taxpayer to apply for new Revenue Ruling for exemption taking consideration of its income earning activities.<br></blockquote>On the other hand, petitioner Foundation consistently argued that it enjoys a tax-exempt status from all taxes as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution as expressly provided under Paragraph 4, Section 4, Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE XIV<br><br>EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ARTS, CULTURE AND SPORTS<br><br>EDUCATION<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 4. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) All revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institution used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties. x x x.<br></blockquote>Moreover, petitioner Foundation denied the respondent's allegations that it engaged in disproportionate profit-earning activities contrary to its educational purpose.

However, this Court finds such fact insignificant. The application for a new BIR Ruling is unnecessary considering that the BIR Ruling was never revoked, and the primary purpose of petitioner Foundation remained the same. Notably, respondent also failed to mention any legal basis that will require petitioner Foundation to secure a new BIR Ruling to confirm its tax exempt status.<br><br>Furthermore, the respondent claimed that petitioner Foundation is not a non-profit educational institution anymore due to its alleged enormous profits. Respondent accused it of operating contrary to the nature of a non-Â­profit educational institution by generating massive profits in the amount of P643,000,000.00 from tuition fees, and having cash worth P775,000,000 in its bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>However, these allegations were completely unsupported by facts and evidence.<br><br>Based on the evidence presented, the P643,000,000.00 is not petitioner Foundation's profit as it is just the gross receipt from school year 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Unfortunately, respondent easily overlooked petitioner Foundation's administrative and non-administrative expenses amounting to P582,903,965.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This sum constituted the total operating expenses of petitioner Foundation for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, the income of petitioner Foundation is only P60,375,183.00 or 9.38% of its operating receipts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This is way below the average gross profit margin rate of 20% for most business enterprises.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the alleged P775,000,000 cash of petitioner Foundation is in reality a part of its Cash and Cash Equivalents account.

Collector of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>To hold that an educational Institution is subject to income tax whenever it is so administered as to reasonably assure that it will not incur in deficit, is to nullify and defeat the aforementioned exemption. Indeed, the effect, in general, of the interpretation advocated by appellant would be to deny the exemption whenever there is net income, contrary to the tenor of said section 27(e) which positively exempts from taxation those corporations or associations which, otherwise, would be subject thereto, because of the existence of said net income.<br><br>Needless to say, <u><b>every responsible organization must be so run as to, at least insure its existence by operating within the limits of its own resources, especially its regular income.

The phrase "<i>all revenues</i>" is unqualified by any reference to the source of revenues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, so long as the revenues and income are used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes, then said revenues and income shall be exempt from taxes and duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, petitioner Foundation firmly and adequately argued that none of its income inured to the benefit of any officer or entity.

Undoubtedly, petitioner Foundation has also proven this second requisite.<br><br>Thus, the tax exempt status of petitioner Foundation under the 1987 Constitution is clear.<br><br>It can be recalled that the questioned CTA <i>En Banc</i> decision only ruled on the procedural aspect of the case on the ground that it is jurisdictional and determinative of the validity of the whole process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The late payment of docket fees allegedly divested the CTA Division of jurisdiction or authority to take cognizance of the petition for review filed before it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> As a result, the decision of the CTA Division was rendered without jurisdiction, and is totally null and void. Thus, the impugned tax deficiency assessment has become final and executory, and its correctness cannot be disputed anymore.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>This Court cannot agree.<br><br>The tax exemption expressly granted by the 1987 Constitution, the supreme law of the land, cannot be set aside by any statute, especially by a mere technicality in procedure. While payment of docket fee and other legal fees within the thirty (30)-day reglementary period to appeal a tax assessment to the CTA is mandatory and jurisdictional, this Court will not hesitate to exercise its equity jurisdiction and allow a liberal interpretation of the rules of procedure if a rigid application will defeat substantial justice.<br><br>This Court has ruled in the past that if a rigid application of the rules of procedure will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice and depending on the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest ill the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The Court's pronouncement in <i>Heirs of Amada Zaulda v.

The law abhors technicalities that impede the cause of justice. The court's primary duty is to render or dispense justice. <u>"<b>It is a more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on appeal rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause a grave injustice to the parties, giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay, if not miscarriage of justice.</b>"</u> x x x<br><br><u><b>What should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor, or property on technicalities. The rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice.</b></u> Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed. At this juncture, the Court reminds all members of the bench and bar of the admonition in the often-cited case of <i>Alonso v. Villamar</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Otherwise stated, procedural rules are important tools designed to facilitate the dispensation of justice, but legal technicalities may be excused when strict adherence thereto will impede the achievement of justice it seeks to serve.<br><br>In the present case, petitioner Foundation timely opposed the tax deficiency assessments against it by filing a Protest or Request for Reconsideration, the proper remedy, before the BIR. Due to respondent's inaction, it filed a petition for review, also the proper remedy, within the reglementary period required by law. In addition, it completely paid the required docket and legal fees in the amount of P861,178.34.<br><br>However, a procedural controversy arose because the payment of the required docket and legal fees was done nine (9) days after the last day for filing the petition for review. To recall, petitioner Foundation's petition for review was filed through a registered mail on April 17, 2006, the last day of filing. It was not able to pay the docket and legal fees on the day of filing because the CTA received the petition and made a computation of the required fees only on April 26, 2006 or nine (9) days after.<br><br>The question now is: should the late payment of the docket fees divest the CTA Division of jurisdiction over petitioner Foundation's petition for review making the VAT deficiency assessment of P122,414,521.70 against a tax-exempt entity final and executory?<br><br>This Court answers in the negative.<br><br>Indeed, the general rule is that a petition for review is perfected by timely filing it and paying the requisite docket fees and other lawful fees. However, all general rules admit of certain exceptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In <i>Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Mangubat</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> where the docket fees were paid six (6) days late, this Court said that where the party immediately paid the required fees showing willingness to abide by the rules, and in view of the significance of the issues raised in the cask the same calls for judicial leniency, thus:<br><blockquote>In all, what emerges from all of the above is that the rules of procedure in the matter of paying the docket fees must be followed. However, there are exceptions to the stringent requirement as to call for a relaxation of the application of the rules, such as: (1) most persuasive and weighty reasons; (2) <u><b>to relieve a litigant from an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure</b></u>; (3) <u><b>good faith of the defaulting party by immediately paying within a reasonable time from the time of the default</b></u>; (4) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (5) <u><b>the merits of the case</b></u>; (6) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (7) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; (8) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby; (9) fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence without appellant's fault; (10) peculiar legal and equitable circumstances attendant to each case; (11) in the name of substantial justice and fair play; (12) importance of the issues involved; and (13) exercise of sound discretion by the judge guided by all the attendant circumstances. Concomitant to a liberal interpretation of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to adequately explain his failure to abide by the rules. Anyone seeking exemption from the application of the Rule has the burden of proving that exceptionally meritorious instances exist which warrant such departure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In other words, while procedural rules are important in the administration of justice, they may be excused for the most persuasive and meritorious reasons in order to relieve a litigant of an injustice that is not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, petitioner Foundation was able to establish that it is a tax exempt entity under the 1987 Constitution. It has timely filed its Protest to the tax deficiency assessment. It was also able to actually pay the full amount of the required docket and legal fees in the amount of P861,178.34, but it was nine (9) days late. Evidently, petitioner Foundation immediately paid the docket and legal fees upon the CTA's assessment of the proper amount which showed petitioner's good faith.<br><br>Moreover, the issue involved in this case is no less than the tax assessment over a non-stock, non-profit educational institution, which the 1987 Constitution mandated to be tax exempt. Otherwise stated, what is at stake is the opportunity for the proper and just determination of petitioner Foundation's status as a tax-exempt entity under the 1987 Constitution, and a deprivation of a substantial amount of property.<br><br>Taking into account the importance of the issues raised in the petition filed before the CTA Division, and what petitioner stands to lose, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> should have considered the merits of said petition. By ruling for the denial of the said petition solely based on technicalities, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> absolutely foreclosed the resolution of the issues raised therein. Definitely, justice would have been better served if the CTA <i>En Banc</i> allowed the resolution of the issues that were raised in the petition.<br><br>This Court agrees with the decision of the CTA Division to give due course to the petition. Consequently, the CTA Division acquired jurisdiction to examine the assailed VAT deficiency assessment, and the latter did not become final and executory.<br><br>Furthermore, the Court finds petitioner Foundation's procedural mistake incommensurate to the grave injustice to be made in violation of the 1987 Constitution's mandate, and petitioner Foundation's payment of P122,414,521.70, representing the VAT deficiency.<br><br>It is worthy to note that this kind of lenient application of the rules of procedure for exceptionally persuasive and meritorious reasons is not novel. In fact, in the case of <i>Tanenglian v. Lorenzo, et al.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this Court gave due course to the appeal which was not only made through a wrong mode but was even filed beyond the reglementary period. This Court recognized the broader interest of justice and reasoned that:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><blockquote>We have not been oblivious to or unmindful of the extraordinary situations that merit liberal application of the Rules, allowing us, depending on the circumstances, to set aside technical infirmities and give due course to the appeal. In cases where we dispense with the technicalities, we do not mean to undermine the force and effectivity of the periods set by law. I those rare cases where we did not stringently apply the procedural rules, there always existed a clear need to prevent the commission of a grave injustice. <b>Our judicial system and the courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement o procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just and proper disposition of his cause.</b> x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In <i>Sebastian v.

This is in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice and that strict and rigid application of rules which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice must always be avoided. <b>It is a far better and more prudent cause o action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case to attain the ends of justice, rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause grave injustice to the parties, giving false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay, if not a miscarriage of justice.</b> (Emphasis supplied; citation, omitted).<br></blockquote>Finally, it is crucial to be reminded that the constitutionally mandated tax privilege granted to non-stock non-profit educational institutions plays an important role in promoting quality and affordable education in the country. In the consolidated cases of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. De La Salle University Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court discussed the important role of this tax privilege for educating the students, to wit:<br><blockquote>We find that the text demonstrates the policy of the 1987 Constitution, discernible from the records of the 1986 Constitutional Commission to provide <u><b>broader tax privilege to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions as recognition of their role in assisting the State provide a public good.
