CEB - CV No. 00974.<br><br><div align="center"><i>The Antecedents</i><br></div><br>On December 10, 1996, petitioner Shemberg Marketing Corporation (Shemberg) executed a real estate mortgage over a parcel of land located in Mandaue City (Lot 1524-G-6), including all improvements, machineries, and equipment found thereon,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in favor of respondent Citibank, N.A.

As a consequence., Shemberg filed the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>assailing the CA Decision and Resolution.<br><br><div align="center"><i>Issue</i><br></div><br>The sole issue for the Court's resolution is <i>whether the real estate mortgage is indeed valid and binding between the parties.</i><br><br><div align="center"><i>The Court's Ruling </i><br></div><br>The Petition is unmeritorious.<br><br>A careful perusal of the First Party Real Estate Mortgage shows that the subject real estate mortgage was executed to secure loan accommodations, as well as all past, present, and future obligations, of Shemberg to Citibank to the extent of P28,242,000.00,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>This Real Estate Mortgage is hereby constituted to secure the following obligations (hereinafter referred to as the "Obligations"):<br><br>1.01 The Principal Obligations specified in the first premise of this Mortgage and any increase in the credit accommodations which MORTGAGEE may grant to MORTGAGOR;<br><br><div align="center">x x x x<br></div><br>1.03 All obligations, whether past, present or future, whether direct or indirect, principal or secondary; whether or not arising out of or in consequence of this Mortgage, and of the credit accommodations owing the MORTGAGEE by MORTGAGOR as shown in this books and records of MORTGAGEE;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Shemberg itself admitted that when the real estate mortgage was executed on December 10, 1996, it had an outstanding obligation totaling P58,238,200.00 with Citibank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The fact that Shemberg's outstanding obligation is significantly higher than the amount of secured obligations does <i>not </i>invalidate the real estate mortgage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It only means that in case of default, Citibank can enforce the mortgage to the maximum amount of P28,242,000.00, which, notably, is simply the total liquidation value of the mortgaged properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>There is thus no question that the subject real estate mortgage covered the US$500,000.00 loan obtained by Shemberg from Citibank on September 13, 1996 under Promissory Note No. 8976267001. Considering Shemberg's failure to pay the balance of US$390,000.00, or its peso-equivalent of P19,006,197.00, under this promissory note, Citibank was well within its rights under the real estate mortgage to initiate the foreclosure proceedings on the mortgaged properties.<br><br>The Court further finds no merit in Shemberg's contention that the real consideration for the real estate mortgage was the renewal and increase of its credit line with Citibank.<br><br>Section 9, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 9. Evidence of written agreements. ‚Äì When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.<br><br><div align="center">x x x<br></div></blockquote><br>Section 9, or what is commonly known as the Parol Evidence Rule, "forbids any addition to or contradiction of the terms of a written instrument by testimony purporting to show that, at or before the signing of the document, other terms were orally agreed on by the parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Under the Parol Evidence Rule, the terms of a written contract are deemed <i>conclusive </i>between the parties and evidence <i>aliunde </i>is <i>inadmissible </i>to change the terms embodied in the document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>This rule, however, is <i>not </i>absolute. Thus, a party may present evidence <i>aliunde </i>to modify, explain or add to the terms of a written agreement <i>if </i>he puts in issue in his pleading any of the four exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule:<br><br></div><div><blockquote><table ¬†="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection in the written agreement; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The validity of the written agreement; or </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(d)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors in interest after the execution of the written agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"> "The <i>first </i>exception applies when the ambiguity or uncertainty is readily apparent from reading the contract."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The <i>second </i>exception pertains to instances where "the contract is so obscure that the contractual intention of the parties cannot be understood by mere inspection of the instrument."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Under the <i>third </i>exception, the Parol Evidence Rule does not apply "where the purpose of introducing the evidence is to show the invalidity of the contract."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> And, the <i>fourth </i>exception involves a situation where the parties agreed to other terms <i>after </i>the execution of the written agreement.<br><br>Here, the first and second exceptions obviously do not apply as the real estate mortgage contract clearly and succinctly stated the terms of the mortgage, leaving no doubt as to the contractual intention of the parties by a mere reading of the document. The third exception, too, is inapplicable since Shemberg's purpose for introducing evidence <i>aliunde </i>is not to invalidate the contract; rather, it was meant to prove that Citibank had reneged on its alleged commitment to renew and increase its credit line with the bank which was supposedly the consideration for the execution of the real estate mortgage. Finally, the fourth exception likewise does not apply as it was never alleged that the parties had agreed to other terms <i>after </i>the execution of the real estate mortgage contract.<br><br>Based on these considerations, the Court sees no cogent reason to overturn the CA's factual findings and conclusions. Simply stated, it is clear that the terms agreed upon in the subject real estate mortgage are binding and conclusive between the parties.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Petition is <b>DENIED. </b>The Decision dated October 23, 2012 and the Resolution dated October 27, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
