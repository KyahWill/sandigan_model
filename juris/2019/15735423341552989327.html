Thus, the description of Roxan's companion as a bald person is insufficient to properly identify Edwin as the perpetrator.<br><br>Additionally, the defense alleged that the in-court identification made by Charlotte and Kim was heavily tainted because even before they were able to identify Roxan's companion, the police already told them that the perpetrator has been arrested.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br><br>After trial on the merits, in its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated August 22, 2014, the RTC convicted Edwin of the crime charged. The RTC ruled that Edwin's alibi would not prosper because he was unable to comply with the requirements of time and place, since he was in Davao City. Hence, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the said Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the Court finds the evidence sufficient to prove the guilt of accused <b>EDWIN DEL ROSARIO</b> beyond reasonable doubt.

The CA explained that denial and alibi by Edwin cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony of the prosecution witnesses.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[39]</sup></font> The CA also ruled that there was conspiracy because the commonality of criminal intent between Edwin and Roxan was apparent: (1) Edwin and Roxan rode the jeepney together; (2) Edwin said "<i>tirahi na ng babaye bai</i>; (3) Roxan grabbed the necklace of Charlotte; and (4) both Roxan and Edwin disembarked from the jeepney and ran away.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The CA, however, modified the penalty and disposed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 16, Davao City dated August 22, 2014 is Affirmed but Modified only as to the penalty imposed on the [prison] term which shall be six (6) months of arresto mayor as minimum to six (6) years of prision correccional as maximum.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br><br>For resolution of the Court is the issue of whether the RTC and the CA erred in convicting Edwin of the crime of robbery.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>At the outset, it must be stressed that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[42]</sup></font> The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><i><b>Edwin's guilt&nbsp; was proven beyond<br>reasonable doubt</b></i><br><br>In the case at bar, the Court adopts the CA's findings and conclusion as to Edwin's guilt. The Court is convinced that the elements of taking of personal property which belongs to another person without his consent have been established and such taking was with intent to gain. The Court consistently held that intent to gain is a mental state whose existence is demonstrated by a person's overt acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As to Edwin's allegation that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the required identification that he was one of the persons responsible for the crime charged, the Court agrees with the CA when it ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Indeed, a perusal of the testimonies [of] both witnesses on direct and cross-examinations would show that they were consistent on their narrative of the incident and of the participation of appellant Del Rosario. Thus, there is no reason to depart from the findings of the trial court especially since "[t]he direct appreciation of testimonial demeanor during examination, veracity, sincerity and candor was foremost the trial court's domain, not that of a reviewing court that had no similar access to the witnesses at the time they testified."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br>As a matter of fact, the testimonies of Kim and Charlotte demonstrate that they are certain that Edwin was the perpetrator:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">[Kim's testimony:] </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><br></td> <td width="95%" valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Okay, are you positive that it is Del Rosario, who is in Court, who gave the signal to Cansancio?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">How certain are you from 1 to 100%?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">101% sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">101%?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q:</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify">101%, your identification?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">That means it is impossible for you to forget the face of accused Del Rosario?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A: </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Yes sir because it is our first time to meet this kind of incident.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q:</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">What happened after you went to the San Pedro Police Station?

Concepcion</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court ruled that when the complainant herself merely testified that the offender snatched her shoulder bag, without saying that such offender used violence, intimidation or force in snatching her shoulder bag, the snatching of the shoulder bag constitutes the crime of theft, not robbery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court reached the same conclusion in the following cases:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>People v. [De la] Cruz</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court found the accused guilty of theft for snatching a basket containing jewelry, money and clothing, and taking off with it, while the owners had their backs turned.<br><br>In <i>People v. Tapang</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> this Court affirmed the conviction of the accused for frustrated theft because he stole a white gold ring with diamond stones from the victim's pocket, which ring was immediately or subsequently recovered from the accused at or about the same time it was stolen.<br><br>In <i>People v. Omambong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court distinguished robbery from theft. The Court held:<br><blockquote>Had the appellant then run away, he would undoubtedly have been guilty of theft only, because the asportation was not effected against the owner's will, but only without his consent; although, of course, there was some sort of force used by the appellant in taking the money away from the owner.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>What the record does show is that when the offended party made an attempt to regain his money, the appellant's companions used violence to prevent his succeeding.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The crime committed is therefore robbery and not theft, because personal violence was brought to bear upon the offended party before he was definitely deprived of his money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br>In the strikingly similar case of <i>Ablaza v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court clarified that "for the requisite of violence to obtain in cases of simple robbery, the victim must have sustained less serious physical injuries or slight physical injuries in the occasion of the robbery."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The Court added that the fact that the necklace was "grabbed" did not automatically mean that force attended the taking. The Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>The OSG argues that the use of the word "grabbed", by itself, shows that violence or physical force was employed by the offenders in taking Snyders' necklaces. The Court, however, finds the argument to be a pure play of semantics. Grab means to take or seize by or as if by a sudden motion or grasp; to take hastily. Clearly, the same does not suggest the presence of violence or physical force in the act; the connotation is on the suddenness of the act of taking or seizing which cannot be readily equated with the employment of violence or physical force. Here, it was probably the suddenness of taking that shocked Snyder and not the presence of violence or physical force since, as pointed out by petitioner, Snyder did not at all allege that She was pushed or otherwise harmed by the persons who took her necklaces.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Applying the foregoing in the case at bar, the crime committed by Edwin is thus clearly only theft, instead of robbery.<br><br>In arriving at this conclusion, the Court is aware that Edwin was indicted under a charge for robbery, not theft. The failure to specify the correct crime committed, however, will not bar Edwin's conviction for the crime of theft. The character of the crime is not determined by the caption or preamble of the information, or by the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The crime committed is determined by the recital of the ultimate facts and circumstances in the complaint or information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In this case, the allegations in the Information are sufficient to make out a charge of theft.<br><br><i><b>Proper Penalty to be imposed</b></i><br><br>The CA imposed the penalty of six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum.
