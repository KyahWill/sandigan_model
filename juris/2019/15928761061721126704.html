				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent Josephine Butlig, Court Stenographer I, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur, is charged with immorality for allegedly engaging in an illicit relation with Leopoldo Gadong, husband of complainant Elizabeth Gadong.<p>In her Sworn-Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated November 14, 2003 filed before this Court, Elizabeth alleged that on April 22, 2002, around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, her husband Leopoldo arrived home from a weeklong vacation in Iloilo City. He left his cellphone on top of the living room table before going to sleep. Elizabeth's sister Rosamie picked up the cellphone to play a game, but immediately handed it to Elizabeth when she discovered love messages from "Joy," Josephine's nickname.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>Elizabeth confronted Leopoldo who could not explain the text messages. She then called Josephine about the issue, but the latter denied sending love messages to Leopoldo. Josephine claimed that someone had borrowed her cellphone and used it to send them. Unconvinced, Elizabeth invited Josephine to meet her at the plaza.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p>There, around 7 o'clock in the evening, she showed Josephine the text messages. The latter again denied sending them to Leopoldo and said she had been using the phone of her sister-in-law Edida Butlig. Shortly after, Leopoldo arrived. Elizabeth confronted both of them, but the two (2) strongly denied having an affair.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p>On May 22, 2002, Elizabeth went to the Government Service Insurance System - Pagadian City Branch to follow-up her loan. She looked outside from the third floor of the building and was surprised to see their family van parked near the stairs of Plaza Luz. She also saw a woman wearing a dark blue uniform follow her husband inside the van. She immediately went down the building to follow them but was unable to reach the van on time. Thus, she boarded a tricycle and instructed the driver to follow the van.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p>When the van parked near Hiker's Palace, Elizabeth told the tricycle driver to stop in front of the building. She then started hitting the side mirror of the van, forcing Leopoldo to open the door. She saw Josephine seated beside her husband. Josephine tried to get out of the vehicle but Leopoldo told her to stay inside. When Elizabeth confronted them, Josephine told her that she rented the van for Php200.00 because she had to go to the Provincial Jail. Later, Josephine changed her alibi and said they were on their way to Macasing to settle the reckless imprudence case that one of her relatives filed against Leopoldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>On April 3, 2003, Elizabeth called Edida to arrange a meeting at the Cathedral. There, Elizabeth told Edida that Leopoldo and Josephine were having an affair. Edida replied that she, too, was growing suspicious because she has seen Leopoldo go into Josephine's house twice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p>On October 28, 2003, around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, somebody informed Elizabeth that Leopoldo and Josephine were together in an apartment unit below the Arro Calibration Center in Pagadian City. Immediately, she and her daughter Ma. Eleosa went to the said place. She knocked on the door and was greeted by Leopoldo. From the doorway, she saw Josephine at the corner of the room, naked and holding her bag to cover her breasts. She rushed inside and pulled Josephine's hair, while Ma. Eleosa took pictures. Josephine, however, grabbed the camera and destroyed it. Leopoldo intervened and told Josephine to wait in the comfort room. Meanwhile, Elizabeth instructed her daughter to call the police.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>A few minutes later, policemen arrived and brought Leopoldo and Josephine to the police station. There, Josephine, on bent knees, promised to end her affair with Leopoldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p>In her Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated February 12, 2004, Josephine denied the charge. She stated that she came to know Leopoldo sometime in 2001 due to a vehicular accident which involved him and a relative of hers. Leopoldo sought her assistance to reach a settlement. From then on, Leopoldo would frequent the court to see her, to the extent of following her around like an <em>"asong ulol."</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p>Although Leopoldo was persistent in courting her, her conscience dictated that she be faithful to her marital vows. This was known to her coÂ­-employees to whom she confided in about her situation. At times, she would even ask them to keep her company to discourage Leopoldo from stalking her. On several occasions, she even reported Leopoldo's stalking to the police station at Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> She denied ever sending love messages to Leopoldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p>As for the October 28, 2003 incident, Elizabeth lied when she claimed she caught her and Leopoldo in a compromising situation. What truly happened was Leopoldo forcibly took her handbag containing her money and cellphone and deceived her into following him to an apartment unit below the Arro Calibration Center. Inside the apartment unit, Leopoldo made sexual advances on her but she resisted. Leopoldo nevertheless succeeded in tearing the blouse she was wearing. A few minutes later, Elizabeth and Ma. Eleosa arrived and mauled her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>Because of what happened, she filed criminal cases before the City Prosecutor's Office of Pagadian City for robbery against Leopoldo, and for physical injuries and slander against Elizabeth and Ma. Eleosa. The present administrative complaint is Elizabeth's way of pressuring her to withdraw these criminal cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p>In her Reply dated March 24, 2005, Elizabeth maintained that everything she said about respondent was true and that her husband even admitted his illicit affair with respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p>Josephine was merely using the criminal charges against her and her family as leverage to force her to withdraw the administrative complaint. Further, Josephine's alleged fidelity to her marital vows should not be believed because she had been separated from her husband for years and was reputed in the locality for indulging in dalliances with different men.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p>Due to the conflicting allegations of the parties, the case was referred to the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court for Pagadian City, Zamboanga del Sur for investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>First Investigation</strong></p><p>During the course of the investigation, Elizabeth testified on the allegations in her Sworn-Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On the other hand, Ma. Eleosa corroborated Elizabeth's allegations regarding the October 28, 2003 incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p>Leopoldo himself also testified. He stated that while driving their family van one day, he met an accident which led to the filing of a case against him for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide. Josephine helped him reach a settlement for the case. Later, he courted her and they entered into a relationship in 2001. From then on, he would fetch Josephine from work to bring her home.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p>On October 28, 2003, he and Josephine had a misunderstanding. He noticed that her cellphone was constantly ringing so he grabbed it. He chanced upon some text messages from another man which made him jealous. He then went ahead to the Arro Calibration Center with her phone and handbag to force her to follow him there. They finished their argument in the room he rented. To simmer down his temper, Josephine undressed. Suddenly, someone knocked on the door. When he opened it, his wife and daughter barged in. They saw Josephine naked, frantically trying to cover herself. A quarrel ensued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p>For her part, Josephine reiterated the defenses she raised in her Comment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Her co-employees Rizalina Imbing, Jocelyn Palo and Victoria Bayawa testified that Leopoldo had been following Josephine wherever she went. He would even wait for hours in their office just to find an opportunity to accompany her home. Whenever Leopoldo was not able to chance upon Josephine at the courthouse, he would mess up her things on her table, without her consent and unmindful of other people inside the office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>SPO4 Matias Cinco also testified for respondent. He stated that Josephine went to the police station at Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur, crying because Leopoldo kept on following her. She was feeling harassed so she sought help from the police. He had no knowledge of any relationship between Josephine and Leopoldo until the latter himself told him about it. He warned Leopoldo to stop harassing Josephine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>First Report and Recommendation</strong></p><p>In his Report on the Investigation with the Corresponding Recommendation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated May 10, 2005, Executive Judge Harun B.

But in view of Judge Ismael's retirement on June 6, 2006, the case was referred to the new Executive Judge, Rolando L.

She portrayed herself as a jealous wife who mistakenly thought her husband Leopoldo was having an affair with Josephine.</p><p>Elizabeth's Judicial Affidavit was replete with recantations. On the alleged amorous text messages from Josephine which were stored in Leopoldo's cellphone, Elizabeth testified:</p><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%">Q:</td><td width="95%">Why did you file that Administrative Complaint against her?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">I filed the Administrative case against the respondent because I got jealous with my husband when my sister Rosamie C.

For records revealed that the October 28, 2003 incident had indeed transpired. On that Tuesday, around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, during office hours, Josephine voluntarily followed Leopoldo to an apartment below the Arro Calibration Center in Pagadian City and was later found without her blouse in a room with Leopoldo.

Thus, the OCA recommended that she be fined in the amount of Php10,000.00 and admonished to behave with decorum and circumspection even in the conduct of her personal affairs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>Threshold Issue</strong></p><p>May respondent be sanctioned for immorality despite the recantation of complainant and her witnesses?</p><p align="center"><strong>Ruling</strong></p><p>We answer in the affirmative.</p><p>Court personnel must be free from any whiff of impropriety, not only with respect to their duties in the judicial branch but also to their behavior outside the court as private individuals. There is no dichotomy of morality; a court employee is also judged by his or her private morals. These exacting standards of morality and decency have been strictly adhered to and laid down by the Court to those in the service of the judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p>Here, Elizabeth's Sworn-Complaint essentially alleged that Josephine had maintained an affair with her husband Leopoldo. Indubitably, such charge, if proven, constitutes immorality that warrant disciplinary action. Thus, in <em><strong>Banaag v.

Administrative actions cannot depend on the will or pleasure of the complainant who may, for reasons of his or her own, condone what may be detestable under our Code of Conduct and most especially our laws. Otherwise, the efforts of this Court in improving the delivery of justice would be put to naught by private arrangements between parties to disciplinary proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p>A recantation, like any other testimony, is subject to the test of credibility. Although findings on credibility of witnesses are generally entitled to great weight, the Court will not shy away from re-examining such findings when cogent reasons call for it,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> as here.</p><p>A perusal of Elizabeth's Judicial Affidavit allows us to filter with ease which narrations were sincere and which were concocted:</p><p><strong>First.</strong> Elizabeth claimed that the text messages from Josephine which she read on Leopoldo's cellphone were not amorous at all; Leopoldo and Josephine were merely arranging a settlement for the reckless imprudence case that Josephine's relatives filed against Leopoldo. There would have been a world of a difference, however, between the tenor of an amorous text message and an assistance for settlement. So much so that the Court is not convinced that Elizabeth would have mistaken one for the other.</p><p><strong>Second.</strong> Elizabeth claimed that the exchange of text messages between Leopoldo and Josephine and their subsequent meet-up on May 24, 2002 were actually for purposes of settling the reckless imprudence case against Leopoldo. The Court finds this hard to believe since Josephine herself admitted the case was already settled as early as 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p><strong>Finally.</strong> Elizabeth testified that she misinterpreted the incident at the Arro Calibration Center; Josephine was merely duped into following Leopoldo into the apartment and the two (2) were not having an affair. But between her allegations in her Sworn-Complaint dated November 14, 2003 and her initial testimony on the one hand, and those in her Judicial Affidavit on the other, the former deserves more weight and credit. Not only was Elizabeth's recantation done twelve (12) years after the alleged incident making it doubtful, her Sworn-Complaint and her earlier testimony conform with human nature and experience.</p><p>The Court, therefore, rejects Elizabeth's recantation and finds the allegations in her Sworn-Complaint dated November 14, 2003, as supported by her testimony and those of her witnesses during the first investigation, more credible.</p><p>But even if the Court disregards the testimony of Elizabeth, the admissions of Leopoldo and Josephine are independently sufficient to establish Josephine's guilt.</p><p>During the initial investigation, Leopoldo admitted to courting Josephine after the latter helped him reach a settlement for the reckless imprudence case against him. According to Leopoldo, they started their relationship in 2001 and from then on, he would fetch Josephine from work and brought her home.</p><p>On October 28, 2003, he and Josephine had a misunderstanding. He noticed that her cellphone was constantly ringing and he got jealous when he chanced upon some text messages thereon from another man. He then went ahead to the Arro Calibration Center with Josephine's phone and handbag to force her to follow him there. They finished their argument in the room he rented. Then, to simmer down his temper, Josephine undressed. Suddenly, someone came knocking at the door. When he opened it, his wife and daughter barged in. They saw Josephine naked and frantically trying to cover herself. A quarrel instantly followed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p>Josephine did not deny being in contact with Leopoldo, albeit they were merely trying to reach a settlement for a reckless imprudence case against the latter. And while Josephine admitted that Leopoldo had been courting her, she denied having ever entered into an illicit relationship with him.</p><p>As for the October 28, 2003 incident, she essentially admitted that when Leopoldo opened the door to the room, Elizabeth and Ma. Eleosa saw her without a blouse. She countered, though, that she merely wanted to recover her handbag and cellphone from Leopoldo but got duped into following Leopoldo inside the apartment in the process.</p><p>We are not convinced.</p><p>To begin with, evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but must be credible in itself, such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p>Here, Josephine's claim that she had been texting Leopoldo to help the latter reach a settlement for a reckless imprudence case deserves scant consideration. For Josephine herself admitted that said case had already been settled as early as 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Yet, as Elizabeth discovered, the two (2) remained in contact and had in fact been meeting up in 2002 and 2003. Josephine was lying through her teeth on May 22, 2002 when she told Elizabeth that they were on their way to see her relatives in Macasing for the settlement. If it were true, Josephine had no reason to lie about renting the van for Php200.00 to go to the provincial jail.</p><p>More, it is indeed quite peculiar, if not contrary to common experience, that Josephine did not bother seeking police assistance when Leopoldo allegedly snatched her handbag and cellphone. For a woman who claimed having been stalked and forcibly undressed by a rejected suitor, it is uncanny that Josephine charged Leopoldo with robbery only, not for any attempt to violate her honor.</p><p>From these circumstances, the Court is convinced that Josephine and Leopoldo had an illicit affair. Josephine is, therefore, and indeed, guilty of immorality.</p><p>Under Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 991936 dated August 31, 1999, otherwise known the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the CSC which is applicable at the time the offense was committed, disgraceful and immoral conduct merits a penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Thus, in <strong><em>Elape v.
