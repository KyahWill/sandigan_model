The NLRC found Cokia Industries Holdings Management, Inc. (CIHMI) and its&nbsp;&nbsp; President&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer&nbsp;&nbsp; George&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee&nbsp;&nbsp; Co&nbsp;&nbsp; (George; collectively, petitioners) to have illegally dismissed Bug-Os and ordered them to pay her backwages,&nbsp; 13th month pay, and service incentive leave pay. The NLRCa]also ordered Bug-Os'&nbsp; reinstatement to her previous position without loss of seniority rights and privileges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><div align="center"><b>Antecedents</b><br></div><br>Bug-Os was employed as CIHMI's&nbsp; accounting personnel on January 2, 2001.&nbsp; She&nbsp; was&nbsp; tasked&nbsp; to&nbsp; do&nbsp; the&nbsp; following:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; prepare&nbsp; salary&nbsp; payrolls, vouchers, and contributions; (2) process loans and submit remittances of the company&nbsp; to various&nbsp; government&nbsp; agencies&nbsp; like the&nbsp; Social&nbsp; Security System (SSS),&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Health&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; (PhilHealth),&nbsp; and Pagtutulungan&nbsp; sa Kinabukasan:&nbsp; Ikaw, Bangko, Industria&nbsp; at Gobyerno (Pag­ Ibig) Fund; and(3) serve as liason officer/authorized representative to various government agencies, including the Department of Labor and Employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>When Biange L. Co (Biange) died, he was replaced by his sister, Shirley L. Co (Shirley),&nbsp; as Corporate&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; Officer/Treasurer&nbsp; of CIHMI in May 2015. Shirley reviewed&nbsp; the documents of the company and discovered that there was a record of a Pag-Ibig loan in her name even though she did not apply for it. After she informed George of her discovery, they began investigating the matter. They discovered several irregularities, including forgeries&nbsp; and&nbsp; falsifications&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; Pag-Ibig&nbsp; loan&nbsp; supposedly&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; by Shirley, and on the remittances to Pag-Ibig. The documents for the loan under Shirley's name bore her forged signature and that of Biange's.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On July 4, 2015, George issued an Office Memorandum to Bug-Os, directing her to explain: "(I) why she participated and connived in applying, processing, and securing a multi-purpose loan in the name of stockholder and corporate officer(s) Shirley Co; (2) why she lied and told Shirley that the latter did not have any loan with Pag-Ibig; and (3) why she attempted to cover up the fact that Shirley has an existing loan with Pag-Ibig that she never applied for." Bug-Os submitted her handwritten explanation on the same day. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; She denied having any knowledge of the irregularities. Allegedly, Gina Co (Gina), sister-in-law of George and Bug-O's immediate supervisor, was the one responsible for the forgery. Bug-Os claimed that she merely prepared the loan forms and submitted it to Pag-Ibig.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On July 6, 2015, Bug-Os tendered her departure through a handwritten resignation letter, which became effective at the close of office hours on the same day. The following day, she sent another handwritten letter authorizing ./<br><br>her cousin, Corazon P. Etac (Etac), to withdraw her salaries, 13th month pay and other amounts due her. On July 30,2015, Etac received the check for Bug­ Os worth P9,163.50 covering her salary for July 1 to 6, 2015, 13th month pay, and proportionate&nbsp; service incentive leave pay. Bug-Os filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against petitioners on August 11, 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Ruling of the Labor Arbiter<br><br>On&nbsp;&nbsp; November&nbsp;&nbsp; 23,&nbsp;&nbsp; 2015,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Labor&nbsp; Arbiter&nbsp;&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug-Os' complaint with prejudice and for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter held that her unjustified&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to submit&nbsp; her position&nbsp; paper is sufficient&nbsp; ground&nbsp; to dismiss her complaint. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the Labor Arbiter ruled that petitioners were able to show that Bug-Os voluntarily resigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> There was no proof that she was merely compelled to do so. She even sent another letter authorizing Etac to claim her monetary benefits on her behalf to CIHMI after she resigned. For the Labor Arbiter, Bug-Os opted for a graceful exit rather than be dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Bug-Os appealed to the NLRC.<br><br><div align="center"><b>Ruling&nbsp; of the NLRC</b><br></div><br>In its June 16, 2016 Resolution,&nbsp; the NLRC dismissed the appeal and affirmed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The NLRC agreed with the Labor Arbiter that Bug-Os'&nbsp; failure to submit her position paper was inexcusable. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The NLRC also held that Bug-Os resigned without waiting for the outcome of the investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The contents&nbsp; of her resignation,&nbsp; position,&nbsp; an undergraduate degree in accounting, 18 units of Masters in Business Administration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> work experience, and the circumstances before and after her departure,&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; her&nbsp; voluntary&nbsp; resignation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, she did not submit evidence that George was hostile towards her.

TheCA was convinced that Bug-Os would not have resigned if not for the harsh words and treatment from petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; the CA held that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration. After the CA denied it in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated November 24, 2017, petitioners filed a petition before this Court to assail the ruling of the NLRC.<br><br><div align="center"><b>Issue</b><br></div><br>The issue before Us is whether the CA erred in affirming the finding of the NLRC that Bug-Os was illegally dismissed.<br><br><div align="center"><b>Ruling&nbsp; of the Court</b><br></div><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Constructive dismissal exists if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him or her except to forego his or her continued employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The test for determining if an employee was constructively dismissed is whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to give up his or her employment under the prevailing circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In contrast, resignation refers to the voluntary act of an employee who is in a situation where one believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service, and one has no other choice but to dissociate oneself&nbsp; from employment.&nbsp; The acts of the employee&nbsp; before and after the alleged resignation must be considered in determining whether he or she, in fact, intended to sever his or her employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The employer has the burden of proving that an employee voluntarily resigned. However, an allegation of constructive dismissal must be proven by the employee,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> especially when he or she has given a resignation letter to the employer, as held in the appropriate case of Gan v.&nbsp; Galderma&nbsp; Philippines, Inc.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Whether the parties were able to discharge their respective burdens involves a review of the factual findings of the courts a quo. While the Court generally does not perform such function, the conflicting findings of the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA call for the same in this case. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>As&nbsp; proof&nbsp; of Bug-Os'&nbsp; voluntary&nbsp; resignation,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; a copy of her handwritten resignation letter. Bug-Os' resignation letter states:<br><blockquote><blockquote>Sirs/Madams, <br>Good day!<br> Effective at the close of office hours of July 6, 2015, I will tender my resignation as an OFFICE EMPLOYEE&nbsp; of your 2 (two) PRESTIGIOUS COMPANIES. Thank&nbsp; you&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; OPPORTUNITY&nbsp;&nbsp; working&nbsp; w/ you.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>On its face, the letter does not have any indication that Bug-Os was forced to execute it. She made no mention of what she claims are false accusations&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp; her.&nbsp; Her&nbsp; words&nbsp; of&nbsp; gratitude&nbsp; further&nbsp; undermine&nbsp; her assertion that she was coerced to resign.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, Bug-Os claims that George and his mother subjected her to harsh treatment the moment the irregular transactions were discovered. This made working for CIHMI unbearable and compelled her to resign. However, she did not submit proof in support of her contentions. Bare allegations alone are insufficient&nbsp; to establish&nbsp; constructive&nbsp; dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Notably, Lolita Perez (Perez),&nbsp; CIHMI's&nbsp;&nbsp; employee&nbsp; in&nbsp; charge&nbsp; of&nbsp; bookkeeping,&nbsp;&nbsp; recording,&nbsp; and preparation of its vouchers and even Bug-Os herself claimed that the latter was never scolded or subjected to disciplinary action by petitioners prior to the discovery&nbsp; of the irregularities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In addition, Perez refuted Bug-Os and averred&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; George&nbsp;&nbsp; scolded&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp;&nbsp; only&nbsp;&nbsp; once&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; relation&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; the irregularities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Moreover, strong words from the employer do not necessarily make the working environment unbearable. When these are uttered "without palpable reason or are expressed only for the purpose of degrading the dignity of the employee, then a hostile work environment will be created."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Bug-Os did not cite the statements&nbsp; made by George that were demeaning to her. Hence, We cannot say whether George uttered words which made working in CIHMI unbearable for her, or simply expressed his anger over the misappropriation of CIHMI's funds.<br><br>We also take note of the fact that Bug-Os resigned&nbsp; merely two days after she was given the Office Memorandum, or from July 4 to 6, 2015. It is incredulous that in that short span of time, she was subjected to so much harassment that it made working for CIHMI unbearable.&nbsp; While there is no fixed period for constructive dismissal, the period from the time Bug-Os was asked to explain the irregularities discovered until she resigned simply does not lend credibility to her claim that she was constructively dismissed.<br><br>Conversely, petitioners submitted evidence to prove that Bug-Os committed irregularities,&nbsp; such as the affidavits of Shirley, Perez, and Edem Manlangit (Manlangit), another employee of CIHMI. Shirley attested to the fact that she did not obtain a loan from Pag-Ibig. Perez enumerated the irregularities&nbsp; she discovered&nbsp; after auditing CIHMI's&nbsp; transactions&nbsp; with SSS and Pag-Ibig of which are: 1) Bug-Os reported an amount for remittance to Pag-Ibig&nbsp; in&nbsp; excess&nbsp; of&nbsp; what&nbsp; was&nbsp; actually&nbsp; deducted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; employees' salaries. She then credited the excess to her loan;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> 2) Bug-Os deducted from the&nbsp; salaries&nbsp; of&nbsp; other&nbsp; employees&nbsp; but&nbsp; credited&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; deducted&nbsp; to&nbsp; the payment of her own loan and that of other persons;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and 3) Bug-Os reported an amount for remittance that is higher than what was actually deducted from her salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As for Manlangit, he affirmed Perez's statement that P5,000 was deducted from his salary but it was credited to the payment ofBug-Os' loan.<br><br>Bug-Os admitted that she was in charge of processing the payroll, vouchers, loan application, and remittances to SSS, Pag-Ibig, and PhilHealth of CIHMI's&nbsp; employees except for herself. However, she denied committing any irregularity and ascribed it to Gina. The determination&nbsp; of whether Bug­ Os&nbsp; defrauded&nbsp; CIHMI&nbsp; is&nbsp; unnecessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; resolve&nbsp; this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Even&nbsp; so,&nbsp; the evidence presented by petitioners in relation to this matter and the January 11, 2019 Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 5 convicting Bug-Os of six counts of estafa, in relation to the remittances to Pag-Ibig, support the finding of the Labor Arbiter that Bug-Os resigned on her own volition, perhaps to avoid further questioning from petitioners.<br><br>We, therefore, disagree with the NLRC and the CA's ruling that Bug­ Os was constructively dismissed. There is a lack of evidence to support this conclusion. As such, the Labor Arbiter was correct in dismissing Bug-Os' complaint.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b>&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; <b>GRANTED.</b>&nbsp; The&nbsp; Decision&nbsp; dated August 25,2017 and the Resolution dated November 24,2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
