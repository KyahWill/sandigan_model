				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A sheriff's act of soliciting sexual favors in exchange for the implementation of a writ of execution is grave misconduct punishable by dismissal.<p> For resolution is this Administrative Matter, which arose from a Letter-Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Arlene S.

Sheriff Santos told her that they had to exchange cellphone numbers so they can communicate in relation to the writ's implementation. Thus, she gave her number.

He claimed that he did not own the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) number 09357519302, though he could not recall what his number was then. He did admit, however, that he twice offered Pineda P10,000.00 in exchange for her withdrawal of the Administrative Complaint or her commitment that she would not attend the investigation hearings. He said the negotiation failed because Pineda demanded P100,000.00, while he could only afford P50,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He alleged that Pineda's motive in filing the case was the money she could get from him upon learning that he had filed his retirement application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p>For her part, Pineda admitted demanding P100,000.00 knowing that Sheriff Santos would haggle the amount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She gave that amount after accounting for the expenses in filing the case, and considering that the amount awarded in her favor in the Decision on the collection of sum of money case was not enough.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> In her August 28, 2018 Investigation Report,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Judge Belino recommended Sheriff Santos' dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> She found that Pineda was able to prove that Sheriff Santos solicited sexual favors from her: </p><blockquote> <p> The afore-quoted text message conversation between the parties indeed transpired. This is substantiated by the saved messages in the cellular phone submitted by the complainant, and forming as integral part of this Report. Sheriff respondent's mere denial that the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) number 09357519302 used in the conversation was not his cannot outweigh the positive statement of the complainant that she was able to save the said number when she and Sheriff Santos exchanged contact numbers on September 15, 2015. Moreover, when the undersigned randomly asked Ma. Magdalena C. Rodriguez, Branch Clerk of Court of MTCC Branch 3, Cabanatuan City, as to what contact number of Sheriff Santos was saved in her cellular phone, BCC Rodriguez dictated "09357519302". And as to when was the last communication between Rodriguez and Sheriff Santos, with the latter using the said SIM number, happened, Rodriguez stated that it was only this year.</p> <p> The tenor of the conversation that the respondent sheriff was asking to meet the complainant at Jollibee, Circumferential Road, Cabanatuan City, and then proceed to the nearby Sogo hotel is very clear and cannot be appreciated other than [an] act of soliciting sexual favors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Judge Belino noted that when Pineda rejected Sheriff Santos' request, he stopped answering her queries and follow-ups on the writ's implementation. He also failed to report to the court the actions he had taken regarding the writ's implementation, as required by Rule 39, Section 14<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p>Judge Belino did not give weight to Sheriff Santos' assertion that since he had already executed the writ on September 15, 2015, he did not solicit sexual favors as a condition to its implementation. She held that under Section 14, the duty to implement the writ continues until the writ's return is satisfied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> Judge Belino held that Sheriff Santos violated Rule 141, Section 9<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the Rules of Court when he collected P300.00 as execution expenses without a proper receipt. She observed that the receipts he had presented were dated November 26, 2012, while the incident complained of happened on September 15, 2015. She noted that sheriffs do not collect execution fees, as they are directly paid to the Office of the Clerk of Court. There was also no evidence to prove that Sheriff Santos made a court-approved assessment of expenses for the writ's execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, Judge Belino found it absurd that Sheriff Santos offered P10,000.00 as settlement amount, and even asked Pineda for forgiveness, if he truly did not commit the charges against him. He even admitted that he submitted a resignation letter before this Court to forestall an administrative case that would be filed against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Judge Belino recommended: </p><ol><li> That this case be <b>RE-DOCKETED</b> as a formal administrative case against <b>JAIME N. SANTOS, Sheriff III, MTCC Branch 3, Cabanatuan City</b>; and<br><br> </li><li> That <b>JAIME N. SANTOS, Sheriff III, MTCC Branch 3, Cabanatuan City</b>, be held administratively liable for the charges of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the interest of service, inefficiency and dereliction of duty, and further recommends that he be meted the penalty of dismissal from service with all the accompanying administrative disabilities provided under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</li></ol> <p> This Court resolves the following issues: </p><p>First, whether or not respondent Sheriff Jaime N. Santos is guilty of gross misconduct for soliciting sexual favors; </p><p>Second, whether or not respondent is guilty of gross misconduct for collecting execution expenses; </p><p> Third, whether or not respondent is guilty of gross misconduct for attempting to pay complainant Arlene S. Pineda in exchange for the withdrawal of the case or her nonappearance in the investigation hearings; and </p><p> Finally, whether or not respondent is guilty of gross misconduct for violating Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court. </p><p>This Court rules in the affirmative. We agree with the findings of Judge Belino and approve the recommended penalty. </p><p> Before going into the merits of the case, this Court emphasizes that once an administrative complaint against its employees has been filed before the court, the complainant can no longer withdraw the complaint. <i>Councilor Castelo v. Sheriff Florendo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> elucidates on this: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court has an interest in the conduct and behavior of all officials and employees of the judiciary and in ensuring at all times the proper delivery of justice to the people. No affidavit of desistance can divest this Court of its jurisdiction under Section 6, Article VII of the Constitution to investigate and decide complaints against erring employees of the judiciary. The issue in an administrative case is not whether the complainant has a cause of action against the respondent, but whether the employees have breached the norms and standards of the courts. </p> <p> Certainly, an administrative complaint against public officers or employees cannot be withdrawn at any time by the simple expediency of a complainant's sudden change of mind. The people, whose faith and confidence in their government and its instrumentalities need to be maintained, should not be made to depend upon the whims and caprices of complainants who, in a real sense, are only witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, this Court holds respondent liable for grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the interest of service, inefficiency, and dereliction of duty for: (1) soliciting sexual favors as a condition for the implementation of the Alias Writ of Execution; (2) collecting the amount of P300.00 as execution expenses; (3) attempting to pay off complainant for the withdrawal of the case or her nonappearance in the investigation hearings; and (4) failing to make a report to the court every 30 days on the proceedings taken in relation to the writ's implementation, in violation of Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court. </p><p> As to the first charge, this Court gives weight to the narration of complainant, which was supported by screenshots of their text message conversations. In their dialogue, respondent stated, "<i>Tulungan nga kita at baka puede punta tau s katabi ng jolibee he he</i>[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Since the place respondent was referring to was a motel,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> his statement implies that he will give his assistance to complainant if she accedes to his request for sexual favors. Failing to present evidence that he used a different cellphone number then, respondent's bare denial that he owned SIM Number 09357519302 is outright self-serving and uncorroborated. This number even matched his contact detail saved in the Branch Clerk of Court's mobile phone, further bolstering the claim that it was, indeed, his SIM number.</p><p> This Court cannot give merit to respondent's allegation that complainant had a monetary motive. This is highly implausible considering that he admitted filing his resignation letter <i>after</i> finding out that she would file a case against him. </p><p> As to the second and third charges, respondent admitted them. In presenting receipts, he implicitly admitted collecting P300.00. He also confirmed that he tried to offer complainant P10,000.00 for the case's withdrawal or her nonappearance in the hearings. Paying off complainant can only be read as an attempt to cover his guilt. </p><p> This Court also finds that respondent, after initially making an effort, no longer tried to implement the writ after complainant informed him on the whereabouts of the judgment debtor. This was corroborated by the lack of a report he was mandated to submit. Hence, he violated Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court, which states: </p><p align="center"> RULE 39 <br> Execution, Satisfaction and Effect of Judgments </p><blockquote> <p align="justify">. . . . </p> <p> SECTION 14. Return of Writ of Execution. — The writ of execution shall be returnable to the court issuing it immediately after the judgment has been satisfied in part or in full. If the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within thirty (30) days after his receipt of the writ, the officer shall report to the court and state the reason therefor. Such writ shall continue in effect during the period within which the judgment may be enforced by motion. <i>The officer shall make a report to the court every thirty (30) days on the proceedings taken thereon until the judgment is satisfied in full, or its effectivity expires</i>. The returns or periodic reports shall set forth the whole of the proceedings taken, and shall be filed with the court and copies thereof promptly furnished the parties. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Councilor Castelo</i>, this Court differentiated simple misconduct from grave misconduct: </p><blockquote> <p> Misconduct has been defined as an unacceptable behavior that transgresses the established rules of conduct for public officers. . . . </p> <p> To qualify as grave misconduct, there must be showing that the erring employee acted with wrongful intentions or that his acts were corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law. </p> <p> As we held in <i>Imperial vs. Santiago</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer. <i>To warrant dismissal from the service, [however], the misconduct must be grave, serious, important, weighty, momentous and not trifling. The misconduct must imply wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment. </i>The misconduct must also have a direct relation to and be connected with the performance of his official duties amounting either to maladministration or willful, intentional neglect or failure to discharge the duties of the office. <i>There must also be reliable evidence showing that the judicial acts complained of were corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Meanwhile, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service is defined as any misconduct that "need not be related or connected to the public officers['] official functions [but tends to tarnish] the image and integrity of [their] public office."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Soliciting sexual favors cannot be anything but an intentional act. It is neither a mere error of judgment nor a simple misdemeanor. It shows the wrongful intention and the corrupt motive of the person asking for it. Respondent brazenly used his position to take advantage of the needs of complainant. Not only did he tarnish the image and integrity of his public office; he also promoted distrust in the administration of justice, which this Court will not condone. For respondent's nefarious act, the most severe penalty of dismissal will be imposed, "not so much to punish [him] but primarily to improve public service and preserve the public's faith and confidence in the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> On a final note, this Court reminds our sheriffs on the importance of their role in the justice system, as explained in <i>Mendoza v. Sheriff IV Tuquero</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Sheriffs play an important role in the administration of justice. They are tasked to execute final judgments of the courts. If not enforced, such decisions become empty victories of the prevailing parties. As agents of the law, sheriffs are called upon to discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence because in serving the court's writs and processes and implementing its order, they cannot afford to err without affecting the integrity of their office and the efficient administration of justice. In <i>Moya v. Bassig</i>, we dismissed respondent sheriff for his failure to execute the trial court's decision. There, we held:</p> <blockquote> <p> "It is indisputable that the most difficult phase of any proceeding is the execution of judgment. Hence the officers charged with the delicate task of the enforcement and/or implementation of the same must, in the absence of a restraining order, act with considerable dispatch so as not to unduly delay the administration of justice; otherwise, the decisions, orders or other processes of the courts of justice and the like would be futile. Stated differently, the judgment if not executed would be just an empty victory on the part of the prevailing party." </p> <p> . . . .</p> </blockquote> <p> The conduct and behavior of every one connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. His conduct, at all times must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum but above all else must be above suspicion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court finds respondent Jaime N. Santos, Sheriff III of Branch 3, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Cabanatuan City, <strong><b>GUILTY</b></strong> of grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the interest of service, inefficiency, and dereliction of duty. He is <b>DISMISSED</b> from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits except accrued leave and with prejudice to re-employment in the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations. </p><p> Respondent is further <b>ORDERED</b> to remit to complainant Arlene S. Pineda the amount of Three Hundred Pesos (P300.00) that he received from her as execution expenses. This is subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Resolution until its full satisfaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b></p><p> <i>Bersamin (C.J.), Carpio, Peralta, Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, A.
