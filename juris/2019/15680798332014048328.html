On November 17, 1997, around 9 o'clock in the evening, she left her workplace. She passed by the store of Ramos along the national road and in front of the <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span><br>National Hospital. She bought food and ate at the store, thereafter, she headed home. She walked by the side of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> National High School. As she was walking, she heard appellant call her name so she approached him. She knew appellant was one of the workers in Metaphil Corporation where she delivered food.<br><br>Appellant dragged her to a dark area near the corner of the road where there were no vehicles passing by. There were also no houses around. Appellant lifted her and laid her down on the grass. She tried resisting him but failed. He threatened to kill her and her parents. Appellant then removed her t-shirt and shorts, sucked her breast, and kissed her neck. He took off her panty and went on top of her. He, too, removed his briefs, spread her legs open, and inserted his penis in her vagina. She felt pain while appellant made push and pull movements for about a minute. He continued kissing her neck while she cried.<br><br>When appellant had finished ravishing her, he let her leave. She did not tell anyone about the rape because she was scared appellant would make good his threat to kill her and her parents. Two days later, her co-worker told her parents about the kiss marks on her neck. Consequently, she was constrained to tell her parents what really hap her. Together with her parents, she went to the municipal hall of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> to have the incident blottered.

He denied having seen AAA approach the store that night. He quit his work at the Metaphil Corporation two days after the incident when he learned of the case filed against him.

It also found that her testimony was corroborated by the physical evidence and Dr. Asagra's expert testimony. Finally, it rejected appellant's bare denial and alibi in light of AAA's positive testimony that it was he who sexually violated her.<br><br><b><div align="CENTER">The Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</div></b><br>On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for rendering a verdict of conviction despite alleged improbabilities<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; in AAA's testimony, viz: <i><b>first</b></i>, the rape incident could not have happened in a place along a well-lighted highway surrounded by a cluster of houses<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> without exposing himself to the eyes and ears of the residents there; <b><i>second</i></b>, although AAA claimed to have stopped by the store on her way home, store attendant Lucille Ricaña could not recall having seen her;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <i><b>third</b></i>, considering that after drinking with his friends in the same store, he left around 9 o'clock in the evening,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> he could not have crossed paths with the victim.<br><br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> riposted that the elements of rape were sufficiently established through AAA's candid, spontaneous, and straightforward testimony that appellant had carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>By Decision dated May 27, 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, viz:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated May 25, 2012, rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 29, Toledo City in Crim.

In a long line of cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court has given full weight and credence to the testimony of child victims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> For it is highly improbable that a girl of tender years would impute to any man a crime so serious as rape if what she claims is not true.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, AAA's testimony rings a bell of truth. Even standing alone, her credible testimony is sufficient to convict appellant<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> given the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved.<br><br>But this is not all. AAA's testimony firmly conformed with Dr. Asagra's medical report that she sustained contusions on her left breast, her vagina admitted one finger with ease, and the hymen was lacerated at 10 o'clock position most likely caused by a penetrating penis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> These findings solidly supported AAA's testimony that appellant dragged her to a dark place, forced her to lie on the ground, kissed her, sucked her breast, and inserted his penis in her vagina. Indeed, when the forthright testimony of a rape victim is consistent with medical findings, it is sufficient to support a verdict of guilt for rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Notably, appellant himself has not imputed any ulterior motive which could have impelled AAA to falsely accuse him of such heinous crime as rape. Her disclosure that she had been raped, coupled with her submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of assault against her dignity, cannot be easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Appellant, nonetheless, undermines AAA's testimony for being allegedly improbable on three counts: <i><b>first</b></i>, he refers to the improbability of allowing himself to be exposed to the eyes and ears of people living along a well-lighted national highway near the supposed <i>locus criminis</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i><b>second</b></i>, the improbability that AAA stopped by a store to buy food, considering that the store attendant could not even recall having seen her;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and <i><b>third</b></i>, the improbability that she crossed paths with complainant around 9 o'clock in the evening of November 17, 1997 considering that around that time, he had already left the same sari-sari store and boarded a tricycle to take him home.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br><i><b>For one</b></i>, rapists are not discouraged from committing sexual abuse by the mere presence of people nearby. In other words, rape is committed not exclusively in seclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The Court has consistently recognized that rape may be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along roadside, within school premises, inside an occupied house, and even where other members of the family are sleeping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> For lust is no respecter of time and place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> At any rate, according to AAA, appellant dragged her to a grassy area where no vehicles were passing by and there were no houses around. <i><b>For another</b></i>, whether the store attendant could recall or recognize the face of AAA as a customer on the night in question does not have any bearing on appellant's culpability. For AAA positively identified him as the one who sexually forced himself on her around 9 o'clock in the evening of November 17, 1997. <i><b>Finally</b></i>, appellant's alibi that he had already left the store and gone home around the same time AAA got raped must fail. In order that alibi may be accorded credibility, appellant must positively demonstrate his presence at another place at the time of the commission of the offense as well as the physical impossibility for him to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> around the same time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Here, appellant did not present any compelling evidence that it was not physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene on the date and time the crime was committed. In any event, alibi cannot prevail over the victim's positive and unwavering identification of appellant as the one who succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> So must it be.<br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals that appellant's abrupt disappearance which lasted for nine long years was indicative of guilt. Appellant disclosed that he abandoned his work two days after he was charged with rape. He also admitted that he left Balamban on November 21, 1997 or four days after the alleged crime was committed. It is well-settled that the flight of an accused may be taken as evidence to establish his guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, the wicked fleeth when no men pursueth, but the innocent is as bold as a lion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>All told, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming appellant's conviction for rape and the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on him.
