				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Two armed assailants as against an unarmed victim and companions constitute taking advantage of superior strength.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b></center><br>This is an ordinary appeal from the June 22, 2018 Court of Appeals (CA) Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02160, affirming the January 22, 2015 Regional Trial Court (RTC) Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. DNO-2932, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>In an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated February 4, 2003, accused Wennie Pespenian<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Pespenian) and Ireneo Salili (Salili) were charged with Murder. Pespenian was arrested and detained, while Salili remains at large.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> During arraignment, Pespenian pleaded not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> A warrant of arrest was issued for the arrest of Salili.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, pre-trial and trial followed.<br><br>The prosecution presented three witnesses: 1) Alejandro Pilota (Pilota), the victim's companion; 2) Neri Valenzona (Valenzona), another companion of the victim; and 3) Dr. Eufemia P. Maratas (Dr. Maratas), Municipal Health Officer of Pilar, Camotes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Pilota testified that at 7 p.m. of January 2, 2003, he was at Joel Manza's (Manza) house with Brigido Colminas (Colminas), Valenzona, and many others to have dinner as it was the last night of prayers for Manza's late wife. After dinner, Pilota, Colminas and Valenzona left. Pilota and Valenzona accompanied Colminas on his way home, because they heard from the other guests that Pespenian and Salili were planning to take Colminas' life.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On their way, they met the two accused. Pespenian stabbed Colminas several times on the left and right chest down to his foot using an eight-inch knife, while Salili was holding a pistol and stayed behind Pespenian.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Pilota saw the whole incident and the identity of the assailants as he was holding a flashlight four meters away from Colminas. He and Valenzona were stunned with the attack and were unable to help Colminas. Thereafter, Pespenian and Salili chased them, prompting them to ran away.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Valenzona corroborated Pilota's testimony. The attack happened about 15 meters away from Colminas' house. He saw Pespenian stabbed Colminas while Salili pointed a gun at the latter. When Colminas fell, Pespenian and Salili went after him and Pilota. They ran away and hid to avoid getting assaulted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The last prosecution witness was Dr. Maratas, who testified that she conducted a post mortem examination on Colminas' body on January 3, 2003, and issued a post mortem report. She confirmed that Colminas had multiple stab wounds which caused massive bleeding that led to his death. Colimas had 18 wounds all over his body, found on his cheeks, forearm, chest, abdomen, right knee, and right foot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For his defense, Pespenian testified that at around 7:30 p.m. on January 2, 2003, he was with Salili fishing. Once done, they went home. On their way, they encountered Colminas, who was holding a knife. Salili and Colminas grappled for the knife. Pespenian feared for his life and left to go home. The following day, he learned that Colminas died, and he was arrested instead of Salili, because he had fled. He said there were no other witnesses to the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Decision</b></center><br>On January 22, 2015, the RTC convicted Pespenian of Murder, imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and ordered him to pay Colminas' heirs P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P25,000.00 as temperate damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The RTC ruled the presence of aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength, which pertains to the inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressors. It was purposely selected to facilitate the commission of the crime. Here, the accused were armed with a knife and a gun, while Colminas had nothing to defend himself. The accused took advantage of their weapons and their number against an unarmed victim, which is an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Pespenian appealed to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Decision</b></center><br>On June 22, 2018, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC's decision. The CA increased the award of moral damages to P75,000.00, exemplary damages to P75,000.00, and temperate damages to P50,000. The CA retained the P75,000.00 civil indemnity. All monetary awards shall earn an interest of 6% per annum from the date of finality of the decision until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Unsuccessful, Pespenian appealed his conviction before the Court.<br><div align="center"><blockquote><b>The Issue Presented</b></blockquote></div>The sole issue for resolution is whether or not the CA erred in affirming Pespenian's conviction for murder.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The Court affirms the conviction.<br><br>In his Brief, Pespenian alleges that the prosecution witnesses failed to identify him as Colminas' assailant because the place of incident was dark and there was no showing that the witnesses saw his face. The Court is not convinced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><i>First</i>, Pespenian admitted during his direct examination that he and Salili encountered the victim, Colminas, on their way home.

His admission contradicts his claim that the prosecution witnesses did not see him because it was dark.<br><br><i>Second</i>, it was established during the examination of the prosecution witnesses that the place where the incident took place was not totally dark. There was illumination coming from the flashlight, which helped the witnesses see the attackers. The witnesses were only four meters away from Colminas as he was being assaulted. The witnesses knew the accused as they lived near each other. Pespenian even admitted during his cross examination that he knew Pilota and Valenzona as they were neighbors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In sum, the light, the distance, and the familiarity with the accused aided the prosecution witnesses to identify them.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The following excerpts support the conviction of the accused.

</tbody></table><br></blockquote>From the foregoing stenographic notes and the Post Mortem 
Examination Report,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[21]</sup></font> the elements of murder are sufficiently 
established that: 1) a person was killed; 2) the accused killed him; 3) 
the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances 
mentioned in Article 248; and 4) the killing is not parricide or 
infanticide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Here, 
the accused Pespenian was positively identified by the two prosecution 
witnesses to have stabbed Colminas that resulted to his death. The 
killing was not parricide as the victim and the accused were not 
ascendants or descendants of each other, and neither is it infanticide 
as the victim is an adult.<br><br>The only element left for discussion 
is whether the killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of 
taking advantage of superior strength in Article 248 of the Revised 
Penal Code.<br><br>In his Brief, Pespenian avers that the prosecution 
failed to adduce evidence to prove that he purposely sought the 
advantage or deliberately used it, in the attack. He asserts that 
Colminas was not defenseless as he had two companions who were supposed 
to protect him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>Here, the RTC determined the presence of qualifying circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength.<br><blockquote>The aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength is considered whenever there is notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressors that is plainly and obviously advantageous to the aggressors and purposely selected or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the crime. It is taken into account whenever the aggressor purposely used excessive force that is "out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked." The victim need not be completely defenseless in order for the said aggravating circumstance to be appreciated.<br><br>In the instant case, accused, in perpetrating the crime was armed with a knife and his co-accused Ireneo Salili with a gun, while Brigido Colminas had nothing to defend himself.<br><br>As testified by the witness, accused Wennie was stabbing Brigido many times while his co-accused Ireneo Salili was pointing a gun at Brigido. The two (2) accused therefore took advantage that they were both armed in attacking their unarmed and defenseless victim. Such intention is evidenced by the 18 stab and incised wounds combined, which can be found in the different parts of the body of the accused on account of the attack made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The CA had a similar pronouncement.<br><blockquote>There is abuse of superior strength when the perpetrators of a crime deliberately used excessive force, thereby rendering the victim incapable of defending himself. The notorious inequality of forces creates an unfair advantage for the aggressor.<br><br>In the case at bench, accused-appellant and his co-accused evidently armed themselves with deadly weapons. Accused-appellant used a knife and with it stabbed Colminas inflicting no less than eighteen (18) wounds upon the latter. Co-accused Salili, for his part, held a gun, which he pointed towards Colminas' direction. On the other hand, Colminas was unarmed. While Colminas had companions at that time, they were similarly unarmed and were overwhelmed by fear of assailants. Accused-appellant and co-accused clearly exploited their superior advantage in number and weapons to ensure the attainment of their hideous plan, <i>i.e</i>., death to Colminas.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>The Court further observes that the prosecution witnesses testified that Pespenian and Salili ran after them after the stabbing incident. This shows that the assailants knew that they had the upper hand because they were armed, and they demonstrated their superiority by going after the unarmed witnesses.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that findings of fact of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by the CA, are binding upon this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> We have reviewed the case and we see no compelling reason to reverse the conviction. The trial court and the appellate court were unanimous in their findings of fact and conclusions of law. Their rulings were based on evidence on record, law, and jurisprudence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the June 22, 2018 Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R.
