Quilatan was again detained after this.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>During trial, PO2 Ocampo and SPO1 Lumabao testified for the prosecution, while only Quilatan testified in his defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated February 25, 2013, the RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and ruled that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the offenses charged. It further ruled that Quilatan's alibi was self-serving, especially since no other witnesses were presented to corroborate his testimony and no complaint was filed against the police officers relative to his alleged illegal arrest. The RTC stated that, in the face of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions in favor of the police officers, Quilatan's alibi could not prevail. Accordingly, the RTC ruled as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgement is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>In <b><i>Criminal Case No. 09-0667 for Violation of Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165</i></b>, the court finds accused <b>JOSE JAMILLO QUILATAN y DELA CRUZ GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <b><i>life imprisonment</i></b> and <b><i>to pay a fine of Php 500,000.00</i></b>;<br><br></li><li>In <b><i>Criminal Case No. 09-0668 for Violation of Sec. 11, Art. II, RA 9165</i></b>, the court finds accused <b>JOSE JAMILLO QUILATAN y DELA CRUZ, GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <b><i>imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months as maximum and to pay a fine of Php 300,000.00</i></b>.<br></li></ol>It appearing that accused <b>JOSE JAMILLO QUILATAN y DELACRUZ</b> is detained at the Para[ñ]aque City Jail and considering the penalty imposed, the OIC-Branch Clerk of Court is directed to prepare the <i>Mittimus</i> for the immediate transfer of said accused from the Parañaque City Jail to the New Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City.<br><br>The specimen[s] are forfeited in favor of the government and the OIC-Branch Clerk of Court is likewise directed to immediately turn over the same to the [PDEA] for proper disposal pursuant to Supreme Court OCA Circular No. 51-2003.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>Quilatan appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> to the CA, interposing the lone issue of whether the trial court gravely erred in convicting him notwithstanding the apprehending team's non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated May 30, 2014, the CA ruled that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt an unbroken link in the chain of custody of the seized items and that their integrity and evidentiary value had been preserved. The fact that there was no representative from the media or the DOJ did not affect the integrity or evidentiary value of the seized items. Besides, Quilatan's defense of frame-up, like alibi, is viewed with disfavor since it can easily be concocted and is a common ploy in most prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Law. In view of these findings, the CA dismissed the appeal and affirmed the RTC Decision. Hence, the instant appeal before the Court.<br><br>The issue in the case at bar is whether the prosecution proved Quilatan's guilt for violation of Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165 beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>In prosecutions involving narcotics, the narcotic substance itself constitutes the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction beyond reasonable doubt. The identity of the narcotic substance must therefore be established beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Section 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of RA 9165, the applicable law at the time of the alleged commission of the crime, lays down the procedure to be followed by a buy-­bust team in the seizure, initial custody, and handling of confiscated illegal drugs and/or paraphernalia. Section 21(a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 (IRR), in turn, filled in the details as to place of inventory and added a saving clause in case of non-compliance with the requirements under justifiable grounds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The requirements outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR are not mere suggestions or recommendations. Undoubtedly, the buy-bust team is not at a liberty to select only parts it wants to comply with and conveniently ignore the rest of the requirements. Unjustified deviations from the prescribed procedure will result to the creation of reasonable doubt as to the identity and integrity of the illegal drugs and, consequently, reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Among the essential requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR are the presence of the three required witnesses - namely, a media representative, a representative from the DOJ, and any elected public official - and the immediate conduct of the physical inventory and photographing of the seized items in the specified places allowed under the law. <u><b>Here, however, the buy-bust team miserably failed to comply with these requirements.</b></u><br><br>A perusal of the records and the evidence presented by the prosecution would show that, even believing its version of a buy-bust operation, the buy-bust team made no effort at all to secure the three required witnesses. The Joint Affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of PO2 Ocampo and SPO1 Lumabao included a summary of the prosecution's narration of events:<br><blockquote>N[A], matapos makuha ang lahat ng detalye tungkol sa aktibidadis (<i>sic</i>) [ni Quilatan] agad ipinaalam ng aming team leader PI TOME sa aming hepe PSSUPT ALFREDO VALDEZ kung kaya't inatasan kami na magsagawa ng buy[-]bust operation sa lugar na nabanggit kung kaya't agad kami nakipag-ugnayan sa PDEA, upang maging lihetimo (<i>sic</i>) ang [aming] gagawing operasyon.<br><br>NA, bago pa isagawa ang operasyon ay nagsagawa muna kami ng maiksing briefing sa aming opesina (<i>sic</i>) at ako (PO2 OCAMPO) ang naatasang umaktong poseur[-]buyer at binigay sa akin ang isang pirasong isang (<i>sic</i>) dalawang daang piso na may serial no.

LQ134794, PP742266 at NP749150 na parehong may markang "EO" sa kanang itaas na parte ng mga nasabing pera at at (<i>sic</i>) ang aming napagkasunduang pre-arrange[d] signal ay ang "PAGTANGGAL NG SUMBRERO" bilang hudyat ng matagumpay na bilihan ng shabu at ako (SPOI LUMABAO) ang naatasang immediate back[-]up kay PO2 OCAMPO.<br><br>NA, matapos maitala sa aming police blotter ang aming gagawing operasyon humigit kumulang <b>9:15 ng gabi ika-15 June 2009</b> sakay ng aming pribadong sasakyan sa pamumuno ni PI TOME ay nagtungo [sa] Tramo St[.], Brgy[.] San Dionisio, Lungsod ng Parañ[a]que upang magsagawa ng buy[-]bust operasyon at sa isang saglit n[g aming] paglalakbay papunta sa aming target na lugar ay narating namin ang kanto ng Tramo St[.], Brgy[.] San Dionisio, Parañaque City at gaya ng aming napagkasunduan ay ako (PO2 OCAMPO) kasama ng isang asset ay unang b[u]maba ng sasakyan habang lihim na nakasunod sa amin ang iba naming kasamahan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>After allegedly receiving the tip from the confidential informant, the buy-bust team was formed, a team briefing was conducted, and the team went to the target area with the informant. <u><b>Conspicuously absent in the narration of facts by the prosecution is the part where the buy-bust team sought the attendance of the three required witnesses.</b></u> From the time they received the tip at 4:30p.m. up to the time they went to the target area at around 9:15 p.m., there was a span of around five (5) hours where they could have easily contacted the required witnesses, but there was no hint that they made any effort to do so. Consequently, the requirement of the presence of all the witnesses at the time of the operation, conduct of inventory, and photographing was not fulfilled.<br><br>While the IRR has a saving clause excusing deviation from the required procedure, the application of such clause must be supported by the presence of the following elements: (1) the existence of justifiable grounds to allow departure from the rule on strict compliance; and (2) the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>As stated in the case of <i>People v. Lim</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the grounds which may justify the failure of the buy-bust team to secure the presence of the three required witnesses are:<br><blockquote>(1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis omitted)<br></blockquote>The above grounds were not present in this case; thus, the buy-bust team's failure to comply with the three-witness rule is inexcusable.<br><br>Moreover, the buy-bust team likewise failed to immediately conduct the inventory and photographing of the seized items in the places allowed by law. The testimonies of both PO2 Ocampo and SPO1 Lumabao showed that the buy-bust team conducted the physical inventory and the photographing of the seized items in a Barangay Hall:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><u>[Testimony of PO2 Ocampo:]</u></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">What about SPO1 Lumabao, what happened to him?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">He assisted me in arresting the suspect and he was able to recover the marked money.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td> <div align="justify">What happened after that?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">We apprised him of his rights.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">What were these rights that you told to him?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">He has the right to remain silent and that we arrested him for charges of selling illegal drugs.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><strong>Q: </strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>What happened now to the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance?</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><strong>A:</strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>Our Team Leader decided to proceed to the Barangay Hall of Brgy.

Despite suggesting in the Joint Affidavit that the target area was near the police station and claiming that they rode a car going to the target area,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the buy-bust team unjustifiably decided to ignore the prescribed procedure and conduct the inventory and photographing of the seized items in a place not allowed under the rules.<br><br>However, both the RTC and the CA saw it fit to tolerate the erroneous conduct of the buy-bust team based only on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty in favor of the buy-bust team.<br><br>The practice of eagerly ascribing the veil of regular performance of duty in favor of the apprehending officers - even in the face of their evident lapses in following the prescribed procedure laid down by law -should not be tolerated. The presumption of regularity in the performance of duties is not a tool designed to coddle State agents unjustifiably violating the law or an excuse for the courts to shy away from their duty to subject the prosecution's evidence to the crucible of severe testing to ascertain whether it is enough to overcome the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.<br><br>Here, the presumption of regularity cannot stand because of the buy­-bust team's brazen disregard of established procedures under Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR.<br><br>The above unjustified procedural deviations bring into question the identity and integrity of the seized drugs.
