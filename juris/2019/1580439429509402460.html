Specifically, a white multi-cab vehicle with plate number NBD-279 with marking "Jarus Jeth" on its body was expected to transport illegal drugs from Pagalungan, Maguindanao to Governor Generoso. Armed with said information, PCI Juaneza and PSI Ramos arranged the conduct of a checkpoint to intercept the vehicle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At around 11:00 o'clock in the morning of July 22, 2014, a team composed of eight (8) police officers, including PCI Juaneza, SPO2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Joselito Alvarez (SPO2 Alvarez), PO3 Teodoro Blaya (PO3 Blaya), and PO3 Alvin Molejon (PO3 Molejon) established a checkpoint at Purok 1, Barangay Tibanban, Governor Generoso, Davao Oriental. The team members strategically positioned themselves near and around the area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>From a distance of about ten (10) meters, the police officers saw the subject multi-cab heading towards the checkpoint, prompting the police officers to prepare to flag down the vehicle. However, even before reaching the vicinity of the checkpoint, the multi-cab stopped and abruptly changed direction, prompting the police officers to pursue the evading vehicle aboard a <i>bongo</i> or pick-up type vehicle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After a brief chase, the police officers stopped and came upon the multi-cab, which had halted. PO3 Blaya testified that he saw all three petitioners alight from the multi-cab and walk towards a nearby hut twenty (20) meters away from the vehicle. Thereat, the police officers caught up with the petitioners, introduced themselves, and warned them not to escape. Then, SPO2 Alvarez noticed that Abdilla was clutching his left hand. Upon SPO2 Alvarez's order, Abdilla handed over one (1) transparent heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance, which was later on identified as "shabu." Meanwhile, Musa and Bito were also frisked by the rest of the team, although nothing was found in their possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Upon receipt of the plastic sachet containing the white substance, SPO2 Alvarez handed the same to PO3 Molejon. At the police station, SPO2 Alvarez and PO3 Blaya both placed their markings<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on the seized drugs. Thereafter, PCI Juaneza prepared the Receipt/Inventory of Property/ies Seized,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which was witnessed and signed by Vice Mayor Katrina Orencia (Vice Mayor Orencia), Kagawad Ermian Limbadan (Kagawad Limbadan) of Brgy. Tibanban, Governor Generoso, and Peter Z. Macado (Macado), a media personality from Mati City.

The following day or on July 23, 2014, he prepared the Request for Laboratory Examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which was duly received by one PO2 Billano.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Upon qualitative examination, the drug specimen tested positive<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or "shabu," a dangerous drug.<br><br>In defense, Abdilla claimed that at around 4:00 o'clock in the morning of July 22, 2014, he went to Tibanban, Governor Generoso to observe the fish there. When he arrived at around 8:00 o'clock in the morning, he found no fish. Thus, he went to the waiting shed near the sea and sent a message to his in-law, asking her to have a vehicle brought over to Tibanban. Later on, a multi-cab arrived with Bito behind the wheel accompanied by Musa. The three of them waited for thirty (30) minutes at the waiting shed. Thereafter, three (3) persons, who introduced themselves as police officers, approached them. Poking their guns at the petitioners, the police officers required them to drop to the ground, where they were frisked and tied with a rope. Nothing was taken from them. Subsequently, they were brought to the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>For his part, Musa asserted that on the date in question, he drove a multi-cab together with Bito to meet Abdilla and catch some fish. They arrived at around 11:30 in the morning at Sigaboy and met Adbilla in a hut. Five (5) minutes later, six (6) policemen arrived and pointed their guns at them, demanding that they bring out the drugs they were selling. Abdilla denied having drugs in their possession. Thereafter, they were brought to the police station. Musa averred that there was no police checkpoint at that time nor were they flagged down by the police. He denied that they turned right in an intersection going to Tibanban and that he saw any road on the right going in the said direction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><div align="center"><b>The</b><b> RTC </b><b>Ruling</b><br></div>  <br>After trial on the merits, the RTC, in a Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated June 22, 2016, found petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged and sentenced them each to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The RTC found that the purpose of petitioners was to transport "shabu," considering that: (<i>a</i>) the multi-cab bearing plate number NDB-279 with marking "Jarus Jeth," which was the subject of the confidential information received by the police officers, suspiciously changed its course to avoid the checkpoint set up by the police officers; (<i>b</i>) after giving chase, the police officers caught up with the multi­ cab which was already at a full stop, and they saw the petitioners alighting therefrom; and (<i>c</i>) they were able to recover a plastic sachet containing "shabu" from the possession of Adbilla.

The essential element of the charge is the <i>movement</i> of the dangerous drug from one place to another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>There is no definitive moment when an accused "transports" a prohibited drug. When the circumstances establish the purpose of an accused to transport and the fact of transportation itself, there should be no question as to the perpetration of the criminal act. The fact that there is actual conveyance suffices to support a finding that the act of transporting was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b> fact</b> <b>of</b> <i><b>"transport"</b></i> <b>of</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>drugs</b><br><br>In this case, it is the prosecution's theory that petitioners <i>transported </i>18.4349 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu </i> on July 22, 2014 from Pagalungan, Maguindanao to Governor Generoso, Davao Oriental using a white multi-cab vehicle with plate number NBD-279 with the marking "Jarus Jeth" on its body. However, the totality of the evidence offered by the prosecution to prove its theory falls short as to justify the affirmance of petitioners' conviction.<br><br><i>First, </i> while it may be true that, per the confidential information relayed by PSI Ramos to PCI Juaneza, a white multi-cab vehicle bearing plate number NBD-279 and the name "Jarus Jeth" on its body traversed the highway and approached the police checkpoint at Purok 1, Barangay Tibanban, Governor Generoso, Davao Oriental, none of the prosecution witnesses was able to identify any of the passengers of the said vehicle. In fact, the first time the police officers were able to see the petitioners was after they had given chase and found the multi-cab vehicle parked close to a nearby hut, inside which petitioners were standing. During his direct examination, SPO2 Alvarez testified:<br><br><blockquote>Atty. Pudpud – What did you do when they change[d] the route?<br><br>SPO2 Alvarez – The team leader advised our troops to chase the vehicle.<br><br>Q – What happened when you chased the multicab?<br><br>A – When we chased them we were able to catch them and stop them on (sic) the small shanty nipa hut with light materials.<br><br>Q – What did they do when you were able to catch up with them? <br><br>A – They are all there standing at the hut.<br><br>Q – They are already alighted from the multicab? <br><br>A – Yes, sir. <br><br>x x x x <br><br>Q – When they approached the checkpoint and avoided the checkpoint, did you notice the other 2 passengers?<br><br>A – No, your honor, because their multicab has covered (sic) on the back.<br><br>Q – You were not able to determine how many are on board? <br><br>A – Yes, sir.<br><br>Q – How about the driver of this multicab, were you able to see?<br><br>A – No, sir.<br><br>Q – So, you were only able to see them on the hut?<br><br>A – Yes, sir.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><br>SPO2 Alvarez affirmed this in his cross-examination, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Atty. Etulle – Now, when you arrived at the hut you saw the multicab park 20 meters away from the hut, am I correct?<br><br>A – Yes, sir.<br><br>Q – Was the engine still running or the engine was already stopped?<br><br>A – Already stopped.<br><br>Q – Did you see any passengers in the multicab?<br><br>A – No, sir.<br><br>Q – Did you see anyone alighted (sic) from the multicab?<br><br>A – No, sir.<br><br>Q – What you see are the 3 persons standing in the hut? <br><br>A – Yes, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br>One of the team members, PO3 Blaya, likewise testified that they did not see petitioners aboard the multi-cab when they caught up with it, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>Atty. Etulle – Now, upon reaching that point you said, you spotted the vehicle the multicab stopped at the open area where the shanty hut was located?<br><br>PO3&nbsp; Blaya – Yes, sir.<br><br>Q – At the time you arrived, was the multicab at (sic) halted or stopped?<br><br>A – The multicab has already stopped, sir.<br><br>Q – Were there still passengers or people inside the multicab? <br><br>A – None, sir. <br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Considering the foregoing testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, it is clear that the identities of the petitioners as the persons who were driving and/or riding the multi-cab purportedly used to transport illegal drugs have not been established with absolute certainty. This identification is material because failure to establish that petitioners were driving or onboard the multi-cab vehicle at any time raises reasonable doubt that they were transporting illegal drugs as charged. The fact that they were standing in a hut close to where the multi-cab was parked when the police officers caught up with them does not prove that they were, at any time, inside the vehicle; necessarily, it does not automatically suggest that they <i>transported </i> illegal drugs.<br><br><i>Second,</i> the inconsistent and flip-flopping testimonies of the police officers as to what really transpired at the checkpoint, among others, raise serious doubt on the veracity of the prosecution evidence. When he testified at the bail hearing, SPO2 Alvarez declared that when they saw the multi-cab approaching the checkpoint, they flagged it down but it merely ran through without stopping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> However, at the presentation of the prosecution's evidence in chief during trial, he completely changed his testimony and stated that the subject vehicle changed direction and avoided the checkpoint altogether.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> When confronted with his contradictory statements by the defense counsel, SPO2 Alvarez merely asserted that his testimony in the direct examination was "what really happened" without, however, offering any explanation for the conflicting statements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Further, SPO2 Alvarez initially claimed having seen two (2) persons in front and one (1) person at the back of the multi-cab;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> subsequently, however, he again changed his testimony and stated that he did not see any passengers at all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Again, no explanation had been forthcoming for the wholly contrasting statements given by SPO2 Alvarez.<br><br>In view of the foregoing statements, the Court entertains reasonable doubt that petitioners transported illegal drugs as charged. The evidence of the prosecution fell short of proving that petitioners were actually on board the multi-cab which, per confidential information, will be supposedly used to transport illegal drugs or that petitioners travelled from Pagalungan, Maguindanao to Governor Generoso for the said purpose. Indeed, the prosecution failed to show that any distance was travelled by petitioners with the drugs in their possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> That petitioners were standing in a hut located within the vicinity of the multi-cab does not prove with certainty that they were the driver and passengers of the vehicle. Undeniably, the conclusion that they were transporting drugs merely because of their proximity to the multi-cab when they were arrested has no basis and is pure speculative at best. It bears stressing that the guilt of the accused must be proved with moral certainty. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove the element of transport of dangerous drugs, namely, that transportation had taken place, or that the accused had moved the drugs some distance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> which does not obtain in this case.<br><br><b><i>Illegal</i> <i>Possession</i> <i>of</i> <i>Drugs <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>under</i> <i>the</i> <i>Variance</i> <i>Doctrine</i></b><br><br>Nevertheless, the police officers testified that they were able to confiscate a heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 18.4349 grams of white crystalline substance in the possession of Abdilla, which, upon qualitative examination, was determined to contain Methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In view thereof, petitioners <i>may,</i> in theory, still be held liable for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 by virtue of the <i>variance</i> <i>doctrine</i> as enunciated in Section 4,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Rule 120 of the Rules of Court. The rule is that when there is a variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information, and that proved or established by the evidence, and the offense as charged necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved included in that which is charged. An offense charged necessarily includes that which is proved, when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> On this score, the <i>transport</i> of the illegal drugs would necessarily entail the <i>possession</i> thereof.<br><br>A conviction for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs requires the confluence of the following elements: (1) the accused was in possession of dangerous drugs; (2) such possession was not authorized by law; and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The dangerous drug seized from the accused constitutes the <i>corpus</i> <i>delicti</i> of the offense. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>thus </b> <b>paramount</b> <b>for </b> <b>the </b> <b>prosecution to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>that </b> <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and </b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seized </b> <b>drug </b> <b>were </b> <b>duly preserved</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sustain </b> <b>a</b> <b>conviction.</b> Otherwise, there would be no basis to convict for Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs because the mere fact of unauthorized possession will not suffice to create in a reasonable mind the moral certainty required to sustain a finding of guilt. More than just the fact of possession, the fact that the substance illegally possessed in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b>The chain of custody rule was not <br></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>observed; hence, the integrity and <br></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>probative value of the <i>corpus</i> <i>delicti <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>were not preserved</b><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> "Chain of custody" is the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of the seized drugs at each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory, to safekeeping and the presentation in court for identification and destruction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In <i>People</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Nandi,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court enumerated the following links that should be established in the chain of custody of the seized items: (1) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; (2) the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; (3) the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and (4) the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court. Accordingly, the prosecution is put to task to account for each link of the chain from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<br><br>In any case, however, the Court has acknowledged that strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> During such eventualities, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: <i>(a) </i> there is a justifiable ground for non­ compliance; and <i>(b) </i> the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> For the saving clause to apply, however, the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Further, the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>A meticulous review of the records in this case shows that there was a glaring gap in the chain of custody of the seized item, thereby affecting its integrity and probative value.

Clearly, therefore, there is a significant gap, a missing link in the chain of custody of the seized item. Because of this gap, there is no certainty that the sachet of drugs presented as evidence during trial was the same drugs found in Abdilla's possession, thereby rendering the probative weight of the seized item highly suspect.<br><br><b>Unjustified</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandate</b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b> of</b> <b>Section</b> <b>21,</b> <b>Article</b> <b>II</b> <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> <b>9165</b><br><br>Furthermore, the stringent requirements under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 were not strictly complied with. As part of the chain of custody procedure, the apprehending team is mandated, immediately after seizure and confiscation, to conduct a physical inventory and to photograph the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if <i>prior </i> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> "a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u></i> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> or (b) if <i>after </i> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, "[a]n elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <i><u>OR</u></i> the media."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The presence of these witnesses safeguards "the establishment of the chain of custody and remove[s] any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>In this case, while the prosecution witnesses alleged that they took photographs of the seized item in the presence of the petitioners as well as of Vice Mayor Orencia, Kagawad Limbadan, and Macado, no such photographs are attached to the records.

It bears to stress that non-compliance with the required witnesses rule may be permitted only if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted <i>genuine </i> <i>and </i> <i>sufficient </i> <i>efforts </i> to secure their presence, although they eventually failed to appear. Although the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the primary objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In this case, it would appear that there was no effort at all to secure the presence of a DOJ representative; hence, non­ compliance with the rule cannot be excused.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated January 30, 2018 and the Resolution dated August 23, 2018 rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
