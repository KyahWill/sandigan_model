The prosecution and the defense moreover stipulated that, in the course of the investigation, PO3 Rivera prepared the Letter Request for Laboratory Examination, Joint Affidavit of Arrest, Booking Sheet and Arrest Report, Letter Referral for Inquest, and the Chemistry Report; and that no elected official nor representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ) were present when PO3 Rivera prepared an Inventory of Items or Property Seized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant denied the charges against her. She claimed that on July 2, 2011, at around 3:00 to 4:00 p.m., she was tending to her grandchild in front of her house at 1503 Loreto Street, Sampaloc, Manila, when five to six police officers in civilian clothes approached, arrested and brought her to the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> At the Sampaloc Police Station, the police officers told her that she was being charged with violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article 11 of RA 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In a September 16, 2014 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 53, found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt as charged. The RTC gave full credence to the version of the prosecution witnesses who were presumed to have regularly discharged their duties as police officers. The RTC ruled that all the elements of the crimes charged had been proved and that the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> had been established by the prosecution. The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused JOCELYN MANECLANG y ABDON Jocelyn/@Iling GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt:<br><ol><li>In <i>CRIM. CASE NO. 11-284738</i>, of the crime of [violation of Sec. 5, Article II, Republic Act [No.] 9165, and is hereby sentenced to suffer [l]ife [i]mprisonment and to pay fine in the amount of <i>P500,000.00</i>; and<br><br></li><li>In <i>CRIM.

Like the RTC, the CA upheld the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty on the part of the police officers, thus, ruling that appellant's weak denial could not prevail over the positive assertions of these police officers. The CA also upheld the appellant's warrantless arrest, and ruled that the search and seizure incidental to this lawful arrest was likewise reasonable and valid.<br><br>The CA also held that there was sufficient compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 relative to the preservation of the seized item's evidentiary integrity under the Chain of Custody Rule. It agreed with the RTC that the prosecution was able to preserve and keep intact the five plastic sachets of shabu from the time these were seized by PO2 Aresta until these were examined and tested by PCI Calabocal and even up to the time these were offered in evidence.<br><br>Hence, the present appeal. Appellant contends that her guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt because the prosecution failed to demonstrate that the apprehending officers did in fact comply with the safeguards provided by RA 9165 for the preservation of the seized items' evidentiary integrity under the Chain of Custody Rule. Appellant likewise maintains that her warrantless arrest was illegal, in consequence of which the warrantless search and seizure of the prohibited drugs were likewise invalid and illegal.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal has merit.<br><br><i>The warrantless arrest and the warrantless search and seizure are valid.</i><br><br>Normally, police officers must be armed with a valid warrant to make a lawful arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> However, there may be instances when arrests are allowed even without a warrant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Rule 113, Section 5 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Arrest Without Warrant; When Lawful. - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>(b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.<br></blockquote>In sustaining appellant's conviction, the CA ruled that this was a clear case of an "<i>in flagrante delicto</i> warrantless arrest" under paragraph (a) of Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, as above-quoted.<br><br>The Court agrees.<br><br>A warrantless arrest under paragraph (a) of Section 5 is valid when these two elements are present: (1) the person to be arrested must perform an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act was done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Here, both conditions concurred. Appellant was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling illegal drugs by PO2 Aresta. In turn, PO2 Aresta effected the arrest since he had personal knowledge of facts indicating that appellant had committed a criminal act. The fact that appellant was not the target person of the buy-bust operation was of no moment. As long as an accused performs some overt act that would indicate that he has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense, the warrantless arrest is justified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Appellant's contention that it was contrary to human experience for her to sell illegal drugs to total strangers does not persuade. We have long observed that "[p]eddlers of illicit drugs have been known with ever increasing casualness and recklessness to offer and sell their wares for the right price to anybody, be they strangers or not. Moreover, drug-pushing when done on a small-scale x x x belongs to those types of crimes that may be committed any time and at any place."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><i>Appellant must nonetheless be acquitted as the chain of custody of evidence was not established.</i><br><br>Even as the sachets of <i>shabu</i> purportedly seized from appellant were admissible in evidence, we find that the prosecution failed to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs. The prosecution not only failed to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crimes charged; it also failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody thereof, in violation of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br>For the conviction of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove: "(1) identities of the buyer and the seller, the object and consideration of the sale; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> "On the other hand, in illegal possession of [<i>shabu</i>], the elements are: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In addition, the identity of the dangerous drugs must be established with moral certainty; it must be shown that the items offered in court were the very same substances seized during the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The prosecution must be able to prove an unbroken chain of custody over the illegal drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>To establish the chain of custody, Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, prior to its amendment by RA 10640<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> pertinently provided:<br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done under oath by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt of the subject item/s: <i>Provided</i>, That when the volume of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: <em>Provided, however</em>, That a final certification shall be issued on the completed forensic laboratory examination on the same within the next twenty-four (24) hours;<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Going by the evidence on record, after arresting appellant, PO2 Aresta took custody of the five plastic sachets of shabu sold to him by, and confiscated from the possession of, the appellant. At the place of arrest, PO2 Aresta marked the five plastic sachets while PO2 Galutera took photographs of the same. The apprehending officers, however, failed to make an inventory because of a commotion at the scene of the crime. An inventory of the seized items was made nonetheless at the police station upon their turnover by PO2 Aresta to the investigating officer, PO3 Rivera. It bears notice, however, that no insulating witnesses were present at said turnover; no elected public official was present, and likewise no representatives from the DOJ and the media were present during the physical inventory of the seized items. Indeed, the Inventory Receipt did not contain the signatures of the required witnesses. During the cross-examination, PO2 Aresta even testified:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Atty.

Although PO2 Aresta alleged that the police team exerted efforts to procure the attendance of these witnesses; this is all allegation - he did not adduce specific evidence that he and his fellow police officers did in fact exert genuine efforts to secure the attendance or presence of a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, or an elected public official to witness the actual inventory and the photographing of the seized prohibited drugs.<br><br>In the recent case of <i>People v. Lim</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> a similar procedural lapse resulted in the undoing of the government's case. The buy-bust team in that case conducted the physical inventory without the attendance of an elected public official and representatives from the DOJ as well as the media because it was allegedly late in the evening; there were no available media representative or <i>barangay</i> officials, despite alleged efforts to contact them. In ruling for the acquittal of the accused, this Court ruled therein that the reason for non-compliance proffered by the arresting team was "unacceptable as there was no genuine and sufficient attempt to comply with the law." The Court held that mere statements that the required witnesses were unavailable, absent serious and actual attempts to contact them were unacceptable reasons for non-compliance; earnest efforts to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses must be proved.<br><br>"It bears emphasis that x x x strict adherence to the mandatory requirements of Section (1) of RA 9165, x x x may be excused as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated items [were] properly preserved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> And in order to ensure that the integrity and evidentiary value were indeed preserved, the proper chain of custody of the seized items must be shown. There are four links that must be established in the chain of custody, to wit: "1) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug confiscated from the accused by the apprehending officer; 2) the turnover of the seized drug by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; 3) the turnover by the investigating officer of said item to the forensic chemist for examination; and, 4) the turnover and submission thereof from [the] forensic chemist to the court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the case under review, it was shown that the five sachets of <i>shabu</i> were marked by PO2 Aresta with "JMA", "JMA-1", "JMA-2", "JMA-3", and "JMA-4" at the place of the arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> At the police station, PO2 Aresta turned over the seized items to the investigating officer, PO3 Rivera, who conducted the inventory, documentation and investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The plastic sachets of shabu were then delivered by PO2 Aresta to the MPD Crime Laboratory Service for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> At this point, it was uncertain who received the seized drugs after it was brought to the forensic laboratory. The Request for Laboratory Examination<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> indicated that it was received by PCI Calabocal, the forensic chemist who tested the nature of the drugs. It is significant to note, however, that PCI Calabocal did not affix his signature thereon. And PCI Calabocal was not presented as a government witness, because his testimony was dispensed with by the prosecution. While there was a stipulation on the testimony of PCI Calabocal, this stipulation merely covered the result of the examination conducted on the drug specimen and not on the source of the substance. There was no stipulation that he indeed received the seized drugs from PO2 Aresta. This, to the Court's mind, constituted an unbridgeable gap in the link of the chain of custody.<br><br>In fine, owing to the breaches of procedure committed by the apprehending officers, we find that the prosecution miserably failed to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crimes and to establish an unbroken chain of custody.
