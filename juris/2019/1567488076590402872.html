According to the RTC, the four-year period was to be reckoned from the discovery of the fraud on December 14, 1992 when Anastacia executed the Notice of Adverse Claim, and it had lapsed when respondents filed Civil Case No. 6703 on December 21, 1998 or six years after.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant case is dismissed with costs against plaintiffs [herein respondents] and reasonable attorney's fee in the amount of P10,000.00 which shall earn legal interest until the same shall have been fully paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, but the RTC, in its Order dated September 14, 2006, denied the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, respondents interposed an appeal before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><i>The CA Ruling</i><br><br>The CA granted respondents' appeal.

The CA further theorized that petitioner would not exert effort to cause the execution of the COS if he had validly purchased the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Since there was actually no consideration of the sale to petitioner and following the principle that a deed of sale in which the stated consideration has not in fact been paid is a false contract, the CA concluded that the DOS is void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The CA awarded moral and exemplary damages in favor of respondents based on its finding that there was no good faith in the manner that petitioner acquired the property of Anastacia because he took advantage of the ignorance of Anastacia and her children by making them believe that the DOS referred to a partition or subdivision of the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The CA observed that the method employed by petitioner smacked of bad faith which ran counter to Articles 19<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The CA likewise awarded attorney's fees because respondents were compelled to litigate or to incur expenses to protect their interest as a result of the unjustified act of petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote><b><i>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</i></b>, this appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.

Petitioner is thus asking the Court to re-examine the evidence presented by the parties, which re-examination is warranted since the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court, a recognized exception to the rule that the findings of fact of the CA are conclusive and binding upon the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The CA observed that "[w]hat is glaring in the evidence and the records of this case is the fact that there was no discussion or assertion whether or not money or cause or consideration exchange[d] hands between Anastacia Kilang and Generoso Sepe."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> To sustain its finding of lack of consideration, the CA relied on the testimonies of Anastacia's daughters that no consideration was paid to their mother by petitioner, without, however, indicating the pertinent pages of the relevant transcript of stenographic notes of their testimonies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Also, the CA interpreted the execution of the Notice of Adverse Claim by Anastacia and the COS as additional proofs that there was no sale by Anastacia of the subject lot to spouses Sepe.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The RTC, on the other hand, found that:<br><blockquote>After a careful perusal of the documentary evidence of plaintiffs, the Court finds their claim to be inadequate and unworthy of belief. For, not only that their claim was only oral which is insufficient as against the documentary evidence in favor of defendant, they are duly notarized, thus, considered as public instruments and having the presumption of regularity under the Rules rendering their claim incredible, not to say, that it is contrary to the usual course of things. For instance, if the Deed of Sale (Exh. "B") dated November 18, 1992 was really spurious and was discovered on December 14, 1992 by Anastacia Kilang to be so that she executed an Adverse Claim, why is it that on December 17, 1992 or just three days after, four of the five children of Anastacia Kilang executed a Confirmation of the Deed of Sale (Exh. "L") wherein they acknowledged the receipt of P40,000.00 from defendant Sepe of which its due execution was not refuted by plaintiffs in the witness stand but simply offered by counsel as an evidence of defendant's alleged master plan in victimizing innocent people. On August 31, 2000 or eight years thereafter, the same Maria Solijon upon being investigated by the NBI (Exh. "M") admitted that the four of the children of Anastacia Kilang except Dominga, received P5,000.00 each from defendant Generoso Sepe allegedly as Christmas gifts which, in the mind of the Court, is not only a flimsy excuse but an implied admission of their confirmation of the sale. Then, on January 14, 1993, Anastacia Kilang executed a Withdrawal of the Adverse Claim leading to the issuance of a new transfer certificate of title to the defendant. Plaintiffs assailed the fingerprints as not belonging to their mother Anastacia more so that the witness thereof was defendant Sepe himself. They even went to the extent of having the fingerprints and signature of Sepe examined by the NBI. Yet, the NBI did not give a clear-cut finding on the fingerprints for being allegedly blurred. In the mind of the Court, the question of the genuineness of the withdrawal of the adverse claim has become moot and insignificant by reason of the confirmation of the sale by the plaintiffs in favor of herein defendant Generoso Sepe (Exh. "L") for they are then estopped to disclaim what they had earlier affirmed to be valid and genuine. Besides, why did they not question the document during the lifetime of their mother Anastacia Kilang when she was the only person who could confirm or refute its genuineness? And, why did it take them only on December 21, 1998, or six years after, to move for its nullification when they filed the first case in court (Civil Case No. 6703) x x x[?]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner relied and continues to rely on the DOS, which was duly notarized, wherein it is stated:<br><blockquote>I, ANASTACIA KILANG, x x x for and in consideration of the sum of FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15,000.00) Philippine currency, to me in hand paid by SPS. GENEROSO SEPE and GAUDENCIA D. SEPE x x x, receipt of the said amount is hereby acknowledged x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>as proof of the receipt of the consideration. In the words of petitioner: "What evidence is more eloquent insofar as proving consideration and parting of the money as consideration of the sale than the document of sale itself, in this case, the "Deed of Sale of a Registered Land' executed by Anastacia Kilang duly notarized."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also points out that the CA's observation that Anastacia had executed the Notice of Adverse Claim with haste showed that she did not sell her property to anybody is speculative because she could no longer testify as to why she executed the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Besides, petitioner adds that the execution of the COS is proof that indeed there was a sale by Anastacia of the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's reliance on the DOS as proof that the sale contemplated therein was supported by sufficient consideration is not without legal basis. The disputable presumption of existence and legality of the cause or consideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> inherent in every contract supports his stance.<br><br>Article 1354 of the Civil Code provides: "Although the cause is not stated in the contract, it is presumed that it exists and is lawful, unless the debtor proves the contrary." Otherwise stated, the law presumes that even if the contract does not state a cause, one exists and is lawful; and it is incumbent on the party impugning the contract to prove the contrary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> If the cause is stated in the contract and it is shown to be false, then it is incumbent upon the party enforcing the contract to prove the legality of the cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>This disputable presumption is also provided in Section 3, Rule 131 of the Rules, which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Disputable presumptions</i>. - The following presumptions are satisfactory if uncontradicted, but may be contradicted and overcome by other evidence:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(r) That there was a sufficient consideration for a contract;<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>In <i>Mangahas v. Brobio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court stated that the presumption of sufficient consideration can be overcome by preponderance of evidence and that mere assertion that the contract has no consideration is not enough, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>A contract is presumed to be supported by cause or consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The presumption that a contract has sufficient consideration cannot be overthrown by a mere assertion that it has no consideration. To overcome the presumption, the alleged lack of consideration must be shown by preponderance of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The burden to prove lack of consideration rests upon whoever alleges it, which, in the present case, is respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>Aside from the presumption of sufficient consideration working in favor of petitioner, the acknowledgment of the DOS before a notary public makes it a public document.<br><br>According to Section 19, Rule 132 of the Rules, documents acknowledged before a notary public, except last wills and testaments, and public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein, are public documents. The certificate of acknowledgment in a notarial document is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the execution of the instrument or document involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> On the other hand, documents consisting of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a public officer are <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts stated therein; and all other public documents are evidence, even against a third person, of the fact which gave rise to their execution and of the date of the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Being a public document, the evidence to be presented to contradict the facts stated in the DOS, which include the payment of the consideration, must be more than merely preponderant as noted by the Court in <i>Alcantara-Daus v. Sps. De Leon</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><blockquote>As a general rule, the due execution and authenticity of a document must be reasonably established before it may be admitted in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Notarial documents, however, may be presented in evidence without further proof of their authenticity, since the certificate of acknowledgment is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the execution of the instrument or document involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> <b>To contradict facts in a notarial document and the presumption of regularity in its favor, the evidence must be clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>That clear and convincing evidence is required to dispute a notarial document is reiterated by the Court in <i>Spouses Santos v. Spouses Lumbao</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>Furthermore, both "Bilihan ng Lupa" documents dated 17 August 1979 and 9 January 1981 were duly notarized before a notary public. It is well-settled that a document acknowledged before a notary public is a public document<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> that enjoys the presumption of regularity. It is a <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein and a conclusive presumption of its existence and due execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> To overcome this presumption, there must be presented evidence that is clear and convincing. Absent such evidence, the presumption must be upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> x x x Nonetheless, in the present case petitioners' denials without clear and convincing evidence to support their claim of fraud and falsity were not sufficient to overthrow the above-mentioned presumption; hence, the authenticity, due execution and the truth of the facts stated in the aforesaid Bilihan ng Lupa are upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>Given the foregoing, the Court is not persuaded by the CA's postulation that the oral refutation by respondents Feliciana and Maria of the consideration stated in the DOS has reached the threshold of the required quantum of proof of clear and convincing evidence. Their mere oral declaration that no consideration was paid to their mother Anastacia is simply not enough given the presence of the following notarized and public documents in petitioner's favor:<br><br>1. DOS, notarized on November 18, 1992, wherein P15,000.00 was stated as the consideration of the sale "to [Anastacia] in hand paid by SPS.

COS notarized on December 17, 1992 wherein Feliciana, Severo, Maria and Donata "for and in consideration of FORTY THOUSAND PESOS (P40,000.00) x x x to us in hand paid to our full satisfaction by SPOUSES GENEROSO SEPE AND GAUDENCIA SEPE x x x do hereby CONFIRM ABSOLUTELY AND IRREVOCABLY, the sale of a parcel of land situated in Barrio Gaboc (now Cabawan District), Tagbilaran City, made and executed by our parents, Anastacia Kilang-Solijon and Fabian Solijon, in favor of herein SPOUSES GENEROSO SEPE AND GAUDENCIA SEPE, and more particularly described as follows, to wit: [technical description of TCT T-10069 follows] x x x[; and] we hereby warrant to defend the rights and peaceful possession of SPOUSES GENEROSO SEPE AND GAUDENCIA SEPE over the above-described real property against any claim whatsoever and we hereby WAIVE ALL OUR RIGHTS over the aforementioned real property in favor of SPOUSES GENEROSO SEPE AND GAUDENCIA SEPE[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The Court moreover agrees with the RTC's observation that respondents should have questioned the DOS during the lifetime of their mother Anastacia given that she was the only person who could confirm or refute its genuineness and contents. It must be recalled that Anastacia died on October 20, 1993,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> about nine months after she executed the Notice of Withdrawal of Adverse Claim and the issuance of TCT T-35367 in the names of spouses Sepe. Indeed, the most credible person who could attest that no consideration was paid by spouses Sepe in connection with the DOS was Anastacia.<br><br>Where a document, like a deed of sale, duly acknowledged before a notary public is disputed, the parties thereto are in the best position to refute its execution and contents. Their testimonies are crucial in order to establish the required proof of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumptions in favor of public documents. Oral declarations by non-parties which contradict the contents of notarial documents should be evaluated and admitted with extreme caution in order not to erode their status and significance as public documents.<br><br>Furthermore, the COS executed by 4 of the 5 children of Anastacia, which is supported by a valuable consideration, bolsters petitioner's cause. It is noted that Dominga, who is not a signatory to the COS, did not testify for respondents. Indeed, respondents have ratified and confirmed the sale of the subject lot by their parents to spouses Sepe. Again, their claim that the amount they received from spouses Sepe was a Christmas gift to them, aside from being incredible as held by the RTC, is not clear and convincing evidence to overcome the facts stated in the COS.<br><br>Given the failure of respondents to adduce clear and convincing evidence to support their cause and overcome the presumptions granted by law in favor of the public documents above-enumerated, the RTC did not err in granting petitioner's demurrer to evidence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
