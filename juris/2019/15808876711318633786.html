				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Section 13(c), Rule 124 of the Rules of Court from the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated February 6, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC. No. 07962, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 16, 2015 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 203, Muntinlupa City (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 10-501 and Criminal Case No. 10-502, finding accused-appellant Hilario De Castro y Santos alias "Dacoy" (De Castro) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, as amended.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>The two separate Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed against De Castro for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165 pertinently read:<br><blockquote><div align="center"><b><u>[Criminal Case No. 10-501 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs)]</u></b><br></div><br>On or about the 4<sup>th</sup> <i>day of August 2010</i>, in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who is not authorized by law, to possess any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully and unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, custody and control Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug weighing 0.12 gram contained in two (2) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets placed inside a yellow plastic container, in violation of the above-cited law.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><div align="center"><b><u>[Criminal Case No. 10-502 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs)]</u></b><br></div><br>That on or about the 4<sup>th</sup><i> day of August 2010</i>, in the City of Muntinlupa, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, not being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, feloniously and unlawfully sell, trade, deliver and give away to another, Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug weighing 0.02 gram contained in one (1) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet, in violation of the above-cited law.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </blockquote>Upon arraignment, De Castro pleaded not guilty to both charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><i>Version of the Prosecution</i><br><br>The version of the prosecution, as summarized by the CA, is as follows:<br><blockquote>The prosecution presented the following persons as witnesses: PCI Richard Allan Mangalip ("PCI Mangalip;" Forensic Chemist); PO3 Aires Abian ("PO3 Abian;" Evidence Custodian); NUP Bernardo Bucayan ("NUP Bucayan;" Receiving Officer); PO3 Manuel Amodia Jr. ("PO3 Amodia[;"], Apprehending Officer").<br><br>The Prosecution and the Defense entered into stipulations, and dispensed with the testimonies of PCI Mangalip, PO3 Abian, and NUP Bucayan.<br><br>The evidence of the Prosecution is summarized thus: on 4 August 2010, at around 2:00 a.m., PINSP Domingo J. Diaz ("PINSP Diaz") instructed the police to conduct the buy-bust operation after receiving a tip from the Informant that the appellant De Castro was selling <i>shabu</i> for P300.00; PINSP. Diaz formed the buy-bust team (i.e.: PO3 Amodia, poseur-buyer; and PO2 Rondivar Hernaez ["PO2 Hernaez"], back-up/arresting officer); the police prepared the Pre-Operational Report, and Coordination Form and PINSP Diaz signed these two documents; the police brought the Pre-Operational Report, the Coordination Form, and the Certificate of Coordination, to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency ("PDEA") as evidenced by Control Number PDEA-MMRO 0810-00029, to comply with the requirement of a legitimate buy-bust operation; the police prepared the buy-bust money consisting of three pieces genuine P100.00 bills, and recorded the operation in the logbook; after the police accomplished the documents, the police and the Informant went to Purok 2, Montillano Street, Alabang Muntinlupa City ("target site").<br><br>PO3 Amodia and the Informant arrived at the target site at 3:00 a.m.; PO3 Amodia and the Informant saw a shirtless man standing on the stairs outside a house; the shirtless man (who later turned out to be appellant De Castro), approached PO3 Amodia and the Informant; the Informant told the appellant De Castro that they (the Informant and PO3 Amodia) wanted to buy P300.00 worth of shabu; the Informant introduced PO3 Amodia to the appellant De Castro as the Informant's cousin; PO3 Amodia handed the appellant [D]e Castro the buy-bust money; after receiving the buy-bust money, the appellant De Castro folded the bills, and inserted the bills in the right waist of the appellant De Castro's shorts; the appellant [D]e Castro then drew from his (the appellant De Castro's) left waist the small, yellow, plastic container, opened the container, took out one small transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance suspected to be <i>shabu</i>, and handed the plastic sachet to PO3 Amodia; PO3 Amodia accepted the plastic sachet and executed the pre-arranged signal that the transaction had been consummated; PO3 Amodia introduced himself to the appellant De Castro as a policeman, and grabbed the appellant De Castro's right hand which was then holding the plastic container; PO2 Hernaez frisked the appellant De Castro and recovered the buy-bust money; PO3 Amodia retrieved from the appellant De Castro's plastic container, two more plastic sachets; PO3 Amodia arrested the appellant De Castro, and informed the appellant De Castro of his constitutional rights, and the reason for the appellant De Castro's arrest; at the place of arrest and seizure PO3 Amodia marked the plastic container with "HDC," and the transparent plastic sachets with "HDC-2" and "HDC-3;" the police brought the appellant De Castro to the Crime Investigation Division Office ("CID Office") for proper inventory and documentation, to avoid commotion; PO3 Amodia was in custody of the seized contraband from the place of arrest, to the CID Office.<br><br>At the CID Office, the police prepared the Certificate of Inventory; several attempts to summon representatives from the media, the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and an elected public official were futile, thus, the police were forced to proceed with the inventory even without the representatives from the media, the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and an elected public official; PO2 Forastero prepared the Booking and Information Sheet, and the Spot Report, and the PDEA received two documents; the police prepared the Request for Laboratory Examination on Seized Evidence, and PINSP Diaz signed it; PO3 Amodia and PO2 Hernaez brought the Request for Laboratory Examination on Seized Evidence, and the seized contraband, to the Southern Police District ("SPD") Crime Laboratory; PO3 Amodia was in possession of the seized contraband from the CID Office, to the SPD Crime Laboratory; PO2 Hernaez delivered and submitted to Receiving Officer Bucayan the Request for Laboratory Examination, and the seized contraband; although PO2 Hernaez was the one who signed the "delivered by" portion of the Request for Laboratory Examination (because it was PO2 Hernaez who had an ID at the time), it was actually Apprehending Office PO3&nbsp; Amodia who handed the seized contraband to the SPD Crime Laboratory; the seized contraband delivered to the SPD Crime Laboratory was never altered; Forensic Chemist PCI Mangalip conducted the laboratory examination, and found that the seized contraband tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, as evidenced by the Physical Science Report No. D-268-10S; Evidence Custodian PO3 Abian received from Forensic Chemist PCI Mangalip the seized contraband bearing the security seals and markings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </blockquote><i>Version of the Defense</i><br><br>On the other hand, the defense presented De Castro as the sole witness and the defense's version, as summarized by the CA, is as follows:<br><blockquote>The evidence of the Defense is summarized thus: on 3 August 2010, at around 7:00 p.m. the appellant De Castro, who was then an Ice Delivery Truck Driver, parked the ice delivery truck at Cas[t]ro, Alabang, Muntinlupa, when a white vehicle arrived and parked in front of appellant De Castro's truck; three men (who later turned out to be policemen) alighted from the white vehicle, and suddenly grabbed and searched the appellant De Castro; appellant De Castro asked the three men what was going on, but the three men just told the appellant De Castro to go with them (the three men); when the police were not able to find anything on the appellant De Castro, the police told the appellant [D]e Castro to board the vehicle; inside the vehicle, the appellant De Castro saw five men in handcuffs; the appellant De Castro again asked for the reason for his arrest, but nobody answered the appellant De Castro; upon arrival at the CID Office, the police took the names of the arrested men, including appellant De Castro; at around 10:00 p.m., the police transferred the men to Block 2, Alabang Precinct, where the police detained the men; at midnight, the police released the other five men, leaving the appellant De Castro under detention.<br><br>On 5 August 2010, at around 3:00 p.m., PO2 Hernaez, one of the police who apprehended the appellant De Castro, brought the appellant De Castro to the Office of the Prosecutor for inquest proceeding; the police returned the appellant [D]e Castro to Block 2, Alabang Precinct, and then transferred the appellant De Castro to the Muntinlupa City Jail; the appellant De Castro later learned that the police had charged him with violation of Section[s] 11 and Section 5, R.A. 9165; the appellant De Castro denied that he sold illegal drugs, and claimed that the police arrested him on 3 August 2010, and not on August 2010 (as claimed by the police).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><center>Ruling of the RTC</center></b><br>In the consolidated Decision dated November 16, 2015, the RTC ruled that the prosecution successfully proved the existence of all the elements of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It further ruled that the buy-bust operation was well-documented, from the Pre-Operational Report, Coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), photocopying of the buy-bust money, the briefing, and the actual operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Therefore, the police officers' conduct was within the acceptable standard of fair and honorable administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It held that the accused's defense of denial cannot prevail over the affirmative and credible testimony of PO3 Amodia pointing to the accused as the seller of the prohibited drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Lastly, it ruled that there was substantial compliance with the legal requirements on the handling of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Their integrity and evidentiary value were not diminished.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The chain of custody of the drugs subject matter of these cases had not been shown to have been broken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Hilario De Castro y Santos @ Dacoy GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 10-501 for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A.

Indubitably, this is the very practice that the law seeks to prevent. The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so — and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished — does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Also, that the police officers tried to call several persons and nobody arrived without sufficient explanation of the attending circumstances is not indicative that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the requisite regarding the presence of the mandatory witnesses.<br><br>In addition, they offered nothing but a flimsy excuse for their deviation from the requirements laid down under Section 21. They merely alleged that they transferred to the police station because people started to come out and there might be a <b><i>possible</i></b> commotion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; They even admitted that they did not bring the necessary documents at the place of arrest when in fact, this should already be standard practice for police officers in conducting buy-bust operations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing that the prosecution has the burden of (1) proving the police officers' compliance with Section 21, RA 9165 and (2) providing a sufficient explanation in case of non-compliance. As the Court <i>en banc</i> unanimously held in the recent case of <i>People v. Lim</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It must be <b><u>alleged</u> </b>and <b><u>proved</u> </b>that the presence of the three witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seized was not obtained due to reason/s such as:<br><blockquote>(1)<b> their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area</b>; (2) <b>their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf</b>; (3) <b>the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended;</b> (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention;</b> or (5) <b>time constraints and urgency of the anti­drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis in the original and underscoring supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>Verily, none of the abovementioned circumstances was attendant in the case. Their excuse for non-compliance is hardly acceptable. Moreover, the buy-bust team could have strictly complied with the requirements of Section 21 had they been more prudent in doing what is required in their job.<br><br>The integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> have thus been compromised, thus necessitating the acquittal of De Castro.<br><br><i>The presumption of innocence of the<br>accused is superior over the presumption of<br>regularity in performance of official duties.</i><br><br>The right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is a constitutionally protected right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In this connection, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty cannot overcome the stronger presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Especially as applied in this case where there are several procedural lapses by the buy-bust operation team which cast doubt as to the regularity in the performance of official duties by the police officers.<br><br>The Court has repeatedly held that the fact that buy-bust is a planned operation, it strains credulity why the buy-bust team could not have ensured the presence of the required witnesses pursuant to Section 21 or at the very least marked, photographed and inventoried the seized items according to the procedures in their own operations manual.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In this case, the presumption of regularity cannot stand because of the buy-bust team's blatant disregard of the established procedures under Section 21 of RA 9165.<br><br>All told, due to the multiple unexplained breaches of procedure committed by the buy-bust team in the seizure, custody, and handling of the seized drug, the prosecution failed to prove the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs: <i>(a)</i> the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and <i>(b)</i> the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Also, the elements of illegal possession of drugs were not satisfactorily proven by the prosecution. The successful prosecution of illegal possession of drugs necessitates the following facts to be proved, namely: (1) the accused was in possession of the dangerous drugs, (b) such possession was not authorized by law, and (c) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>For both offenses, it is crucial that the prosecution establishes the identity of the seized dangerous drugs in a way that the integrity thereof has been well-preserved from the time of seizure or confiscation from the accused until the time of presentation as evidence in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In this case, the prosecution utterly failed to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were preserved. The same breaches of procedure in the handling of the illegal drug subject of the illegal sale charge equally apply to the illegal drug subject of the illegal possession charge. Corollary, the prosecution was not able to overcome the presumption of innocence of De Castro.<br><br>De Castro must perforce also be acquitted of the charge of violating Section 11, RA9165.<br><br>As a reminder, the Court exhorts the prosecutors to diligently discharge their onus to prove compliance with the provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended, and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, which is fundamental in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. <b>To the mind of the Court, the procedure outlined in Section 21 is straightforward and easy to comply with</b>. In the presentation of evidence to prove compliance therewith, the prosecutors are enjoined to recognize any deviation from the prescribed procedure and provide the explanation therefor as dictated by available evidence. Compliance with Section 21 being integral to every conviction, the appellate court, this Court included, is at liberty to review the records of the case to satisfy itself that the required proof has been adduced by the prosecution whether the accused has raised, before the trial or appellate court, any issue of non-compliance. If deviations are observed and no justifiable reasons are provided, the conviction must be overturned, and the innocence of the accused affirmed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
