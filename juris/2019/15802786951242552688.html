Acting on this report, P/Supt. Manuel Apostol instructed his subordinates to conduct a buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> He (PO3 Yaris) was designated as poseur-buyer and PO3 Bayan as back-up. They prepared the buy-bust money consisting of one Php 1,000 bill marked with his initials "ELY." Thereafter, the CI accompanied the team to the place of operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Around 1:20 in the morning, appellant arrived. The CI approached appellant and they had a brief conversation. He later joined in and the CI introduced him to appellant as an interested buyer. He said he was buying Php1,000-worth and handed the marked bill to appellant, who, in turn, brought out one (1) heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from his right pocket and turned it over to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After he secured the item, he placed it in his pocket and arrested appellant. PO3 Bayan and PO2 Lucena rushed to where they were and helped him restrain appellant. He conducted a body search following the latter's arrest and recovered the buy-bust money, a cellular phone, two (2) lighters, and a Swiss knife from him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Ten (10) minutes later, media representative Rico Valdez and <i>Punong Barangay</i> Pepito Lim arrived at the place of arrest.

PO2 Bermudez took photos to document the operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>His team brought appellant to the City Health Office for medical examination. He prepared the request for laboratory examination and submitted it with the plastic sachet to the Regional Crime Laboratory Office 1.

When he arrived at the place of arrest, he saw PNP members, appellant, and <i>Punong Barangay</i> Lim. PO3 Yaris showed him the seized items consisting of a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance, buy-bust money in the amount of Php1,000, a cellphone, two (2) lighters, and a Swiss knife, all laid down on the pavement. Thereafter, PO3 Yaris marked the items in their presence and prepared an inventory.

He narrated that even before his arrest, he already knew PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan because he arranged an entrapment operation with them for the arrest of a certain Gina Alvento who planned on illegally mortgaging a firearm to his brother, the Chief <i>Barangay Tanod</i>. The police officers provided him with Php2,000 boodle money for the operation.<br><br>On June 29, 2013, Alvento went to his house with a .38 firearm. He tried to contact PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan but failed to reach them so other officers arrived to arrest Alvento.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He surmised that PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan were humiliated because other police officers had step in to effect the arrest of Alvento which they were supposed to perform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan took the incident against him personally.<br><br>Thereafter, on July 3, 2013, around 11 o'clock in the evening, he was on his way home when PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan, on board a motorcycle, suddenly stopped near him. PO3 Bayan placed his hands inside his pockets and claimed that he recovered something therefrom. The policemen brought him to the precinct and boxed him in the abdomen before taking him to the City Health Office the next day.<br><br>He maintained that he only had a lighter, a cellular phone, one (1) Php500 bill, and five (5) Php100 bills in his possession at that time;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> PO3 Yaris planted the supposed buy-bust money in his pocket. He recognized the Php1,000.00 marked bill as part of the original Php2,000 boodle money given to him by PO3 Yaris for the entrapment operation against Alvento.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Trial Court's Ruling</b></center><br>As borne by its Decision dated May 5, 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the trial court rendered a verdict of conviction, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused Edgardo Garcia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A.

Ramos and Associate Solicitor III Analyn G. Avila defended the verdict of conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It argued that all the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were established by testimonial, documentary and object evidence; the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved; and the <i>corpus delicti</i> was identified in open court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>More, the totality of evidence showed that the chain of custody was not broken. PO3 Yaris testified that he arrested appellant and seized items from him following a buy-bust operation; conducted the inventory of the seized items in the presence of media representative Valdez and <i>Punong Barangay</i> Lim; prepared the inventory which Valdez and Lim signed while PO2 Bermudez took photographs; prepared the request for laboratory examination; and turned over the documents and sachet to Regional Crime Laboratory Office 1. These led to the indubitable conclusion that the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> were preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Finally, appellant's defenses of denial and frame-up failed against the evidence of the prosecution. Police officers were presumed to have acted regularly in the performance of their official functions, absent any proof to the contrary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></center><br>By Decision dated September 30, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It found that all the elements of the crime were present and appellant was positively identified in open court as the subject of the buy-bust operation. More, appellant raised the alleged broken chain of custody for the first time on appeal. At any rate, the chain of custody was substantially complied with and the<i> corpus delicti </i>was established with certainty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Finally, appellant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to substantiate his defense of denial and frame-up; the presumption of regularity of performance of official duties therefore prevailed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Present Appeal</b></center><br>Appellant now asks the Court for a verdict of acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In compliance with Resolution dated June 28, 2017, both appellant and the OSG manifested that in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br>Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial court's verdict of conviction despite the attendant procedural deficiencies relative to the chain of custody over the <i>corpus delicti</i>!<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b></center><br>We acquit.<br><br>In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[38]</sup></font> Thus, even if appellant challenged the arresting officers' compliance with the chain of custody rule first time on appeal, the Court is not barred from reviewing whether there was indeed unjustified deviation from the rule.<br><br>Petitioner was charged with unauthorized sale of dangerous drug allegedly committed on July 4, 2013. The governing law, therefore, is RA 9165. Section 21 of which prescribes the standard in preserving the <i>corpus delicti</i> in illegal drug cases, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Section 21. C<i>ustody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;</b> (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br><center>xxxx</center></blockquote>The Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 further commands:<br><blockquote><b>Section 21.</b> (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, <b>a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ</b>), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items, (emphasis added)</blockquote>To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <b><i>first</i></b>, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i><b>second</b></i>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i><b>third</b></i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and <i><b>fourth</b></i>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>This is the chain of custody rule. It came to fore due to the unique characteristics of illegal drugs which render them indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Records show that the arresting officers here had repeatedly breached the chain of custody rule.<br><blockquote>Prosecution witness PO3 Yaris testified:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">PROS.

The Court held in <i><b>People v. Ramirez</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> that marking of the seized item immediately after seizure is vital to ensure its integrity and veracity by preventing switching, planting, or contamination of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Here, PO3 Yaris testified to placing the seized item in his pocket without marking them immediately upon confiscation. The marking was only done when Valdez and Lim arrived around ten (10) minutes following appellant's arrest. During this ten (10)-minute interval, the <i>corpus delicti</i> remained in PO3 Yaris' pocket without any way of differentiating it from other drug items that may have been in PO3 Yaris' possession, too, at that time. This cast serious doubt on the identity of the item that was later marked and inventoried. For we cannot foreclose the possibility that what PO3 Yaris retrieved from his pocket was the same item allegedly sold by appellant. Even media representative Valdez admitted that he was unsure of the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti.</i><br><br>Thus, the rationale behind the marking requirement was defeated when PO3 Yaris placed the <i>corpus delicti</i> in his pocket for ten (10) minutes before marking it. The arresting officers failed to guarantee that what PO3 Yaris recovered from his pocket and eventually marked was the same drug item he supposedly received from appellant during the buy-bust operation.<br><br><i><b>Second</b></i>, there was no representative from the DOJ to witness the physical inventory and photograph of the seized items. No valid reason was offered for this omission. PO3 Yaris merely testified that they did not even bother contacting a DOJ representative because it was already early morning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In rendering an acquittal, the Court held in <i><b>People v. Lim</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> that mere statements of unavailability of the required witnesses, by themselves do not excuse non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165. It is still necessary for the prosecution to establish that earnest efforts were made to secure the presence of the required witnesses.<br><br><i><b>Finally</b></i>, the prosecution did not present any witness to testify on how the forensic chemist handled the specimen during laboratory examination and how the evidence custodian preserved it thereafter. In <b><i>People v. Ubungen</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court ruled that absent any testimony on the management, storage, and preservation of the seized illegal drug, the fourth link in the chain of custody could not be reasonably established.<br><br>Indeed, the chain of custody was broken from its incipience until its final stages. Although a saving clause in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 allows deviation from established protocol, this is subject to the condition that justifiable grounds exist and "so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Here, since the arresting officers offered no valid explanation for the procedural deficiencies, the saving clause cannot be validly invoked, barring the proviso from coming into play.<br><br>Suffice it to state that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> cannot substitute for compliance in an attempt to reconnect the broken links. For it is a mere disputable presumption that cannot prevail over clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> And here, the presumption was amply overturned, nay, overthrown by compelling evidence on record of the repeated breach of the chain of custody rule. Verily, a verdict of acquittal is in order.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated September 30, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R CR-H.C.
