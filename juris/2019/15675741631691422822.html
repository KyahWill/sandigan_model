Gungon</i> (<i>Yenko</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> an employee could not have incurred absences in the office where he was assigned since the reassignment thereat was void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, respondent's acts (<i>i.e</i>., reporting for duty at the ICTD, which it found to be connected to the OCV, as well as repeatedly protesting his reassignment and seeking reinstatement to his former workstation) were inconsistent with any intention to go on AWOL or abandon his post.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]<i>&nbsp; </i></sup><i>Lastly</i>, the CA held that since respondent continued reporting for work in the ICTD, there was no reason for him not to submit any performance evaluation form. Hence, he was allowed to submit the required form to avail of the productivity incentive benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; moved&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; but was denied in&nbsp; a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated September 18, 2017; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The core issue before the Court is whether or not respondent was validly dropped from the rolls.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>At the outset, it bears noting that since petitioner no longer questioned the rulings of the CSC and the CA as regards the invalidity of respondent's reassignment to the Mayor's office pursuant to Memorandum No. 33/12 and the CA's&nbsp; ruling on respondent's&nbsp; entitlement to productivity incentive benefits, the Court will no longer pass upon such issues. What remains to be resolved is <b>whether or not respondent could properly be considered on AWOL</b> as to warrant the dropping of his name from the rolls.<br><br>The petition is granted.<br><br>Section 93 (a) (1),<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[39]</sup></font> Rule 19 of the Revised Rules on the Administrative Cases in the Civil Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (RRACCS) provides that a public officer or employee shall be dropped from the rolls if he was on AWOL for at least thirty (30) days. AWOL means that the employee is leaving or abandoning his post without justifiable reason and without notifying his employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In the present case, a perusal of Memorandum 17/03 shows that respondent's dropping from the rolls was premised on his failure to report for duty at the Mayor's office pursuant to a reassignment order, which was subsequently declared void for amounting to constructive dismissal based on the CSC Rules on Reassignment. Jurisprudence is clear that a government employee could not have incurred absences in his reassigned station if his reassignment thereat was void,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> as in this case. Thus, the Court finds that respondent could not be validly dropped from the rolls merely for failing to report for work at the Mayor's office.<br><br>This notwithstanding, respondent should still&nbsp; be considered on AWOL, and therefore validly dropped from the rolls because he neither: (<i>a</i>) reported for work at his original post at the OCV; nor (<i>b</i>) filed leave applications during the period he was contesting his reassignment to the Office of the Mayor.<br><br>In several cases wherein government employees were given void reassignments to different workstations and thereafter dropped from the rolls for failing to report thereat, the Court did not consider those employees on AWOL because they either (<i>a</i>) reported to their original workstations while contesting their reassignment orders<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) filed leave applications for the period that they failed to report for work at the reassigned station, even though those applications were later denied or no leave applications were filed for subsequent periods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> None of these circumstances were extant in this case.<br><br>Instead, in this case, respondent, without any proper authority or justifiable reason therefor, chose to report for work at the ICTD, which, contrary to the CA's&nbsp; ruling, is an office separate from the OCV and discharges functions different from the latter. While the ICTD is concerned with information and communications&nbsp; technology, the OCV deals with animal-related activities and policies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> To work for a specific public office, it is necessary that the same be by virtue of a valid personnel action made according to the proper procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Surely, an employee cannot just decide in what office or department he or she will work. Hence, given the lack of authority or justifiable reason, respondent's performance of work in the ICTD cannot&nbsp; be counted&nbsp; as attendance&nbsp; at work.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; he is considered on AWOL for his failure to report for work for more than thirty (30) days, and therefore, correctly dropped from the rolls under Memorandum No. 33/12.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the&nbsp; pet1t10n is&nbsp; <b>GRANTED</b>. Accordingly,&nbsp; the Decision dated February 27, 2017 and the Resolution dated September 18, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 142879 are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> for the reasons above-discussed. Respondent Dr. Josefino E.
