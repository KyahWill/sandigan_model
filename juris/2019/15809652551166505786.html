The Land Bank then appraised the property at Php34,994.36 per hectare based on the prescribed formula under DAR Administrative Order (DAR AO) No. 5, s. of 1998. This valuation, however, was only applied to the 33.5017-hectare portion since the 2.8151-hectare area pertained to a non-compensable legal easement.

The State shall further provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing, (emphasis added)</blockquote>Just compensation is the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to intensify the meaning of the word "compensation" and to convey thereby the idea that the equivalent to be rendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In computing the just compensation, the trial courts take into consideration the value of the land "at the time of the taking" or when the landowner was deprived of the use and benefit of his or her property, such as when title is transferred to the Republic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Here, the Court of Appeals correctly reckoned the time of taking as of 2001. Indeed, records bear that: (i) the notice of coverage for the property was sent to respondents on February 20, 2001; (ii) petitioner received the Claim Folder from the DAR on October 5, 2001; and (iii) TCT No. T-126930 was issued under the name of the Republic on November 26, 2001. This Court considers the date of transfer of the property to the name of the Republic on November 26, 2001 as the time of taking.<br><br>Consequently, RA 6657, prior to its amendment by RA 9700, governs the present case. This finds support in Section 5, RA 9700 which amended Section 7, RA 6657, in this wise:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Priorities</i>. - The DAR, in coordination with the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) shall plan and program the final acquisition and distribution of all remaining unacquired and undistributed agricultural lands from the effectivity of this Act until June 30, 2014.

All private agricultural lands of landowners with aggregate landholdings in excess of fifty (50) hectares which have already been subjected to a notice of coverage issued on or before December 10, 2008; rice and corn lands under Presidential Decree No. 27; all idle or abandoned lands; all private lands voluntarily offered by the owners for agrarian reform: <i>Provided</i>, That with respect to voluntary land transfer, only those submitted by June 30, 2009 shall be allowed <i>Provided, further,</i> That after June 30, 2009, the modes of acquisition shall be limited to voluntary offer to sell and compulsory acquisition: <i>Provided, furthermore,</i><b> That all previously acquired lands wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners shall be completed and finally resolved pursuant to Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended:</b> xxx (emphasis added)</blockquote>The provision is clear: any new valuation method introduced by the DAR pursuant to RA 9700 cannot be given retroactive effect as to cover agricultural properties taken prior to the enactment of said law.<br><br>Section 17 of RA 6657 enumerates the relevant factors in determining just compensation, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>Section 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation.</i></b> — In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of the like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</blockquote>This provision had been translated into a basic formula under pertinent DAR administrative issuances. In determining just compensation, courts are duty bound to apply both the compensation valuation factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657 and the applicable basic formula.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>DAR AO No. 5, s. of 1998 was still in force at the time of taking in this case.

Thus, as between the 2001 average of Php688.75 which petitioner used, on one hand, and the six (6)-year average of Php 1,195.45 which the Court of Appeals utilized, on the other, the former has stronger legal mooring.<br><br>In contrast, the Court of Appeals' use of 2002 and 2003 data finds no support in law. In fact, it contradicts the hornbook doctrine that just compensation be based on the value of the land "at the time of taking." In fine, private respondents cannot derive any benefit nor suffer prejudice from any change in the value of the property after the government had already taken it.<br><br>In light of the foregoing considerations, the amount of just compensation here should be fixed, as follows:<br><br><b>A.
