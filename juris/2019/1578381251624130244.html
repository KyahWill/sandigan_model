The CA explained a clerical error in the trial court's decision for indicating Criminal Case No. 07-284 instead of Criminal Case No. 07-285. The records show that Baya had not been arraigned in Criminal Case No. 07-284. As such, the trial court had not acquired jurisdiction over the accused, and the CA remanded the case for arraignment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> Further, the body of the trial court's decision finding Baya guilty of rape pertains to the allegations covered by the Information of Criminal Case No. 07-285.

The Information did not include Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act 8353 (RA 8353) or the Anti-rape Law. </p><p> Still, Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 states that if the victim is below 12 years old, the offender shall be prosecuted under the RPC. </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; Provided, That <b>when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be:</b> Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period; (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The provision above referred to the old article on rape and acts of lasciviousness of the RPC, because RA 7610 was approved on June 17, 1992, prior to the enactment of RA 8353 on September 30, 1997. RA 8353 repealed Article 335 of the RPC, and formed new provisions as found in Articles 266-A to 266-D under Crimes against Persons. With this legal development, Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 should be amended to replace Article 335 with Article 266-A of the RPC. Thus, even if the Information did not include the relevant provision of the RPC, Baya was still prosecuted and convicted under the RPC because RA 7610 mandated it. </p><p> Furthermore, in <i>People v. Ejercito</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court explained that RA 8353, amending the RPC, should be uniformly applied in rape cases against minors. </p><blockquote> <p> Between Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, xxx and Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, the Court deems it apt to clarify that Ejercito should be convicted under the former. Verily, penal laws are crafted by legislature to punish certain acts, and when two (2) penal laws may both theoretically apply to the same case, then the law which is more special in nature, regardless of the time of enactment, should prevail. In <i>Teves v. Sandiganbayan</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is a rule of statutory construction that where one statute deals with a subject in general terms, and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more detailed way, the two should be harmonized if possible; but <b>if there is any conflict, the latter shall prevail regardless of whether it was passed prior to the general statute</b>. Or where two statutes are of contrary tenor or of different dates but are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, <b>the one designed therefor specially should prevail over the other</b>. (Emphases in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> After much deliberation,<strong> the Court herein observes that RA 8353 amending the RPC should now be uniformly applied in cases involving sexual intercourse committed against minors, and not Section 5 (b) of RA 7610. Indeed, while RA 7610 has been considered as a special law that covers the sexual abuse of minors, RA 8353 has expanded the reach of our already existing rape laws. These existing rape laws should not only pertain to the old Article 335 of the RPC but also to the provision on sexual intercourse under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610 which, applying <em>Quimvel</em>'s characterization of a child "exploited in prostitution or subjected to other abuse," virtually punishes the rape of a minor.</strong> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The pronouncement above was reiterated in the more recent case of <i>People v. Tulagan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> After review of the records in Criminal Case No. 07-285 for rape against BBB, the prosecution's evidence established the elements under Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353. </p><p> Article 266-A states that rape is committed: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>1.</b> <b>By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</b> </p> <p> a. Through force, threat, or intimidation; <br> b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; <br> c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and <br> d. <b>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age</b> or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. (Emphasis supplied.) </p> </blockquote> <p> The circumstance applicable in this case is Par. (d) considering that BBB was nine years old at the time of the incident as proven by her birth certificate. The fact of carnal knowledge was established through BBB and CCC's positive identification of Baya as their abuser. BBB testified he removed her shorts and panty, positioned himself on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. BBB's Initial Medico-Legal Report showed "clear evidence of blunt force or penetrating trauma." With the prosecution sufficiently establishing all the elements of rape applicable in this case, Baya's guilt was proved beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Court sustains the CA's conviction on rape. </p><p align="center"> <b>III.</b> </p><p> In Criminal Case No. 07-287 for acts of lasciviousness against CCC, Baya was charged of violating Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of the RA 7610. </p><p> In <i>People v. Ladra</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court held that "before an accused can be held criminally liable for lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, the requisites of the crime of [a]cts of [l]asciviousness as penalized under Article 336 of the RPC x x x must be met." </p><p> </p><p> Article 336 of the RPC states that acts of lasciviousness is committed by:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">1.</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Anyone who commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2.</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">The offended patty is another person of either sex; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">3.</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">The act/s is done under any of the following circumstances: </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Through force, threat, or intimidation; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify">When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age</b> or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present; (Emphasis supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>On the other hand, Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 provides that: </p> <blockquote> <p> Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — <b>Children, whether male or female, who</b> for money, profit, or any other consideration or <strong>due to the coercion or influence of any adult,</strong> syndicate or group,<strong> indulge in</strong> sexual intercourse or<strong> lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse. </strong></p> </blockquote> <p> The penalty of <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed upon the following: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (b) <b>Those who commit</b> the act of sexual intercourse or <b>lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse</b>; <em>Provided</em>, That <b>when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under </b>Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and<b> Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be:</b> Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be<i> reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period; (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The elements of acts of lasciviousness under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 are:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%">(1)</td> <td width="97%"> the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td> the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3)</td> <td>that the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Section 2(h) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases or the IRR of RA 7610 defines lascivious conduct as: </p> <blockquote> <p> h) "Lascivious conduct" means the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person</p> </blockquote> <p> Here, CCC testified that Baya raised her shorts and pressed his penis into her vagina. However, since the shorts were tight, his penis did not penetrate her. BBB corroborated CCC's testimonies. Clearly, the act complained of constitutes as lascivious conduct under the IRR of RA 7610. </p><p> The element of minority is proved by CCC's birth certificate, which showed that she was nine years old on September 26, 2006, having been born on May 16, 1997. The prosecution sufficiently established all the elements of acts of lasciviousness under the RPC and RA 7610, which proved Baya's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Court sustains the CA's conviction on acts of lasciviousness. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV.
