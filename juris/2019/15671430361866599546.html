The project included, among others, the application of a [granite] wash-out finish on the exterior walls of the building.<br><br>[PCIB] accepted the turnover of the completed work by [WGCC] in a letter dated June 1, 1992. To answer for any defect arising within a period of one year, [WGCC] submitted a guarantee bond dated July 1, 1992 issued by Malayan Insurance Company, Inc. in compliance with the construction contract.<br><br>The controversy arose when portions of the [granite] wash-out finish of the exterior walls of the building began peeling off and falling from the walls in 1993. [WGCC] made minor repairs after [PCIB] requested it to rectify the construction defects. In 1994, [PCIB] entered into another contract with Brains and Brawn Construction and Development Corporation to re-do the entire [granite] wash-out finish after [WGCC] manifested that it was "not in a position to do the new finishing work," though it was willing to share part of the cost. [PCIB] incurred expenses amounting to [P]11,665,000[.00] for the repair work.<br><br>[PCIB] filed a request for arbitration with the [Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC)] for the reimbursement of its expenses for the repairs made by another contractor. [WGCC], on the other hand, interposed a counterclaim for [P]5,777,157.84 for material cost adjustment.<br><br><b>The CIAC, by <i>Decision</i> of June 21, 1996 [CIAC Decision], found that [PCIB] was entitled to recover from [WGCC] the sum of [P]9,741,829.00 representing cost of repairs done by another contractor on the project. It also awarded [WGCC]'s counterclaim in the amount of [P]5,777,157.84.</b> The CIAC accordingly disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"After summing up the award to both parties this TRIBUNAL hereby awards the amount of x x x [P3,964,671.16] to CLAIMANT [PCIB]. [WGCC] is hereby ordered to pay the stated amount <b>with legal interest of x x x 6% x x x from date of this decision until fully paid</b>."<br></blockquote><b>[WGCC] assailed that portion of the foregoing [CIAC Decision] that rendered it liable for the construction defects.

No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ART. 2209. If the <b>obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in delay</b>, the indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the contrary, shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon, and in the absence of stipulation, the <b>legal interest, which is [6%] <i>per annum</i></b>.<br><br>ART. 2210. Interest may, in the discretion of the court, be allowed upon <b>damages awarded for breach of contract</b>.<br><br>ART. 2211. In crimes and quasi-delicts, interest as a part of the damages may, in a proper case, be adjudicated in the discretion of the court.<br><br>ART. 2212. Interest due shall earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded, although the obligation may be silent upon this point.<br><br>ART. 2213. Interest cannot be recovered upon unliquidated claims or damages, except when the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Monetary interest under Article 1956 serves as compensation fixed by the parties for the use or forbearance of money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As can be gleaned from the foregoing provision, payment of monetary interest is allowed only if: (i) there was an express stipulation for the payment of interest; and (ii) the agreement for the payment of interest was reduced in writing. The concurrence of the two conditions is required for the payment of monetary interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, compensatory interest (<i>i.e.</i>, interest awarded as damages under Articles 2209 to 2213 of the Civil Code) is that which is "allowed in actions for <b>breach of contract or tort</b> for the unlawful detention of money already due."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As the governing provisions indicate, compensatory interest may be imposed by law or by the courts as penalty or indemnity for damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In <i>Eastern Shipping</i>, the Court set forth the guidelines on the computation of compensatory interest in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:<br><br>1. When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, <i>i.e.</i>, a <b>loan or forbearance of money</b>, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, <i>i.e.</i>, from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Civil Code.<br><br>2. When an obligation, <b>not constituting a loan or forbearance of money</b>, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the <i>discretion of the court</i> at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. <b>Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially</b> (Art. 1169, Civil Code) <b>but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date of the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).</b> The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount of finally adjudged.<br><br>3. When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, <b>this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Subsequently, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board (BSP-MB) issued Circular No. 799, series of 2013 reducing the rate of interest applicable on loan or forbearance of money from 12% to 6% per annum. The reduced rate became effective on July 1, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In <i>Nacar v. Gallery Frames</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court clarified that the reduced interest rate of 6% per annum can only be applied prospectively. Thus, the rate of 12% per annum shall be made to apply until June 30, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><i>WGCC is entitled to compensatory interest reckoned from the issuance of the CIAC Decision.</i><br><br>As earlier stated, the principal award represents the material cost adjustment incurred by WGCC which PCIB failed to pay. The award proceeds from PCIB's breach of its construction contract with WGCC — a contract which does <i>not</i> constitute a loan or forbearance of money. Accordingly, the interest disputed herein constitutes compensatory interest awarded pursuant to Article 2210 of the Civil Code, thereby falling under paragraph 2 of the guidelines set forth in <i>Eastern Shipping</i>.<br><br>PCIB insists that it cannot be held liable to pay compensatory interest, since the CIAC Decision directing payment of the principal award in WGCC's favor was silent in this respect. According to PCIB, the imposition of such interest at this stage in the proceedings would run counter to the rule on immutability of judgments.<br><br>PCIB's assertions lack merit.<br><br>To recall, the CIAC initially found: (i) WGCC liable to pay PCIB for construction deficiencies amounting to P9,741,829.00; and (ii) PCIB liable to pay material cost adjustment amounting to P5,777,157.84. These amounts resulted in a net award in favor of PCIB, in the amount of P3,964,671.16. The CIAC Decision explicitly imposed compensatory interest upon such net award, at the rate of 6% per annum.<br><br>The relevant portion of the CIAC Decision states:<br><blockquote><b>VII.

No. 142830 completely absolving WGCC from liability, the only award which now remains is the material cost adjustment adjudged in favor of WGCC. <b>Such principal award in the amount of P5,777,157.84 evidently remains subject to compensatory interest which CIAC imposed on the <i>net</i> award initially adjudged in favor of PCIB, but later deleted by the Court with finality.</b><br><br>As correctly observed by the CA:<br><blockquote>In the [CIAC Decision], finding that under the parties' contract, increase for labor and materials under certain conditions was allowed but that [PCIB] presented no strong, or at best, token opposition to the evidence presented by [WGCC] for the escalated cost of materials, the CIAC awarded [WGCC]'s counterclaim in the amount of [P]5,777,157.84. Under the contract, [PCIB] is liable for materials cost adjustment but it failed to pay the same and that therefore, [WGCC] is entitled to an award of interest because of the former's breach. <u><b>The CIAC, however, did not [explicitly] award interest to [WGCC], not because the latter is not entitled thereto but because [WGCC] had also liabilities with [PCIB] upon which the CIAC did not also impose interest.</b></u> <b>Yet, in the dispositive portion of the [CIAC Decision], the CIAC awarded "<i>legal interest of [6%] from the date of this decision until fully paid</i>" on the net liability ([P]3,964,671.16) of [WGCC] after its counterclaim ([P]5,777,157.84) was offset against its liability ([P]9,741,829.00) with [PCIB]. Since the [Decision of the Court in G.R. No. 142830] merely reversed that portion of the [CIAC Decision] that made [WGCC] liable for construction deficiencies, the award of 6% interest stands, which may [now] be applied to the amount awarded to [WGCC].</b> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The CA was likewise correct when it reckoned the imposition of compensatory interest from the issuance of the CIAC Decision on June 21, 1996.<br><br>To recall, compensatory interest shall begin to run either:<br><ol><li>From the date of judicial or extrajudicial demand (where the claim is liquidated or can otherwise be established with reasonable certainty);<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> or<br><br></li><li><b>From "the date the judgment of the court [or quasi-judicial body] is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></li></ol>The reckoning point for compensatory interest, when imposed on unliquidated claims, is set on the date of the judgment of the court or quasi-judicial body granting the award since it is only at such time when the amount claimed becomes "liquidated," that is, determined with reasonable certainty.<br><br>In this case, WGCC's claim became "liquidated" on June 21, 1996, the day the CIAC Decision awarding its counterclaim amounting to P5,777,157.84 was issued. Hence, WGCC is entitled to compensatory interest at the rate of 12% from June 21, 1996 to June 30, 2013, and 6% interest from July 1, 2013 until finality of this Decision.<br><br><i>WGCC is entitled to interest imposed on the entire award.</i><br><br>In addition to the compensatory interest awarded in its favor, WGCC claims that pursuant to the Court's ruling in <i>Eastern Shipping</i>, it is also entitled to "interest on interest" at the rate of 12% per annum, reckoned from April 27, 2006 until full payment.<br><br>This is error.<br><br>To recall, paragraph 3 of the guidelines set forth in Eastern Shipping stems from Article 2212 of the Civil Code which, in turn, provides that "[i]nterest due shall earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded, although the obligation may be silent upon this point."<br><br>In <i>Hun Hyung Park v. Eung Wong Choi</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court clarified that the "interest on interest" referred to by Article 2212 only covers <i>accrued</i> interest.<br><blockquote>x x x Article 2212 of the Civil Code x x x does not apply because "interest due" in Article 2212 refers only to <i>accrued</i> interest. A look at the counterpart provision of Article 2212 of the new Civil Code, Article 1109 of the old Civil Code, supports this. It provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 1109. <u><b>Accrued interest</b></u> shall draw interest at the legal rate from the time the suit is filed for its recovery, even if the obligation should have been silent on this point.<br><br>In commercial transactions the provisions of the Code of Commerce shall govern.<br><br>Pawnshops and savings banks shall be governed by their special regulations. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Nevertheless, the Court finds that while WGCC is not entitled to "interest on interest," it is, consistent with the Court's ruling in <i>Eastern Shipping</i>, entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum applied to the entire award computed from the finality of this Decision until full satisfaction, said entire award now being deemed to be a forbearance of credit during the interim period.<br><br>The records of the case show that as early as March 10, 2009, BDO (for and on behalf of PCIB) issued and delivered two checks to WGCC in the following amounts:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Check No.</strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Amount</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">00059321</div></td><td><div align="center">P1,965,816.45</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">00059322</div></td><td><div align="center">P5,777,157.84</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">Total</div></td><td><div align="center"><strong>P7,742,974.29</strong></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>These checks were issued and delivered to WGCC pursuant to the February 2009 CIAC Writ directing the immediate enforcement of the CIAC Decision, subject to the outcome of WGCC's CA Petition. To recall, the February 2009 CIAC Writ reads, in part:<br><blockquote>This Tribunal finds that there is no legal obstacle to the immediate enforcement of payment of the following undisputed amounts in favor of WGCC[:]<br><ol type="a"><li>the principal award of P5,777,157.84[;] and<br><br></li><li>the award of 12% interest [per annum] on the principal award of P5,777,157.84 computed from [April 27, 2006] until such time as the judgment award is fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Thus, PCIB's remaining liability is equal to the sum of the following amounts (i) principal award; and (ii) compensatory interest applied to the principal award reckoned from the <i>issuance</i> of the CIAC Decision until finality of the judgment award, minus <b>P7,742,974.29</b>:<br><br>In turn, the sum of (i) and (ii) above <b>less P7,742,974.29</b> shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of this Decision until full payment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the Petition docketed as G.R.
