The public officials added that a team had been created to monitor the cutting and earth balling of the trees.

Thus, the cases were dismissible on procedural grounds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the trial court noted that while their witness, Dr. Michael A. Bengwayan, quantified the effects of removing 182 trees on Luneta Hill, his testimony appeared to be "mere conclusions of fact devoid of any scientific basis"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and failed to prove that removing the trees would have a detrimental effect causing irreparable damage to the environment and Baguio City residents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In contrast, Dr. Armando Palijon, a common witness for both parties, testified that removing the trees would not cause irreparable damage to the environment, as the loss would be compensated by SM Investments Corporation's planned green building and the thousands of saplings it planted in Busol Watershed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The trial court also gave weight to the testimony of Engineer Cherry B.

She testified that the mitigation measures in the Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan had accounted for minimizing the project's environmental impact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the trial court held that Cordillera Global Network and Adajar, et al. failed to substantiate their claims of irregularities in the cutting and earth-balling permits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and building permits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> issued to Investments Corporation.<br><br>The trial court also set aside the challenges raised against the amended Environmental Compliance Certificate. It stated that the field of expertise Professor Cecilia M. Austria (Dr. Austria)—who questioned the reliability of the Environmental Performance Report and Management Plan—is zoology, not environmental science. This makes her incompetent to determine lapses in the Environmental Impact Assessment. On the other hand, the trial court found that SM Investments Corporation and its subsidiaries were able to prove that it had complied with the requirements to issue an environmental compliance certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The trial court ruled that there was no reason to prevent SM Investments Corporation and it's subsidiaries from pushing through with the Expansion Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The dispositive of the Regional Trial Court Decision read:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>judgment is hereby rendered <b>DISMISSING </b>the Complaints dated February 23, 2012 and April 13, 2012 and the Amended Urgent Petition to Cite Defendant for Contempt dated April 20, 2012.<br><br>The <b>Temporary Environmental Protection Order dated April 10, 2012 </b>is hereby <b>LIFTED.</b><br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </blockquote><br><br>After filing their notices of appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Cordillera Global Network and Adajar, et al. filed their respective appeals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In its December 12, 2014 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied the appeals and upheld the findings of the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>The Court of Appeals dismissed Cordillera Global Network and Adajar, et al.'s claim that the case fell under the exceptions to the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies since there was no patent illegality. It pointed out that despite not being parties to the applications for the environmental compliance certificates, tree-cutting and earth-balling permits, and building permits, they still should have come to the appropriate administrative tribunals to resolve questions of fact. Such questions are generally referred to an administrative agency for its "special knowledge, [and] experience ... to determine technical and intricate matters of fact."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that Cordillera Global Network and Adajar, et al. failed to rebut the presumption of regularity of official acts.

They claim that a separate environmental compliance certificate would only be superfluous since the tree-cutting and earth-balling activities were already part of the implementation of the Expansion Project covered by the amended Environmental Compliance Certificate dated September 22, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Public respondents maintain that social acceptability, as understood by petitioners, is not required to issue an environmental compliance certificate. Instead, what is required is the stakeholders' participation in the environmental impact assessment process. Nonetheless, public respondents note that even if this was not mandatory, private respondents still conducted public consultations and submitted a report on social acceptability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Private respondents SM Prime Holdings, Inc. and Shopping Center Management Corporation allege that petitioners erred in relying on <i>Lina, </i>which categorically stated that public projects needed public consultation but was silent on a similar requirement for private projects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> They likewise claim that <i>Boracay Foundation, Inc. </i>does not apply in petitioners' case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>On the issue of validity of the issued permits, private respondent SM Investments Corporation refutes petitioners' claim that Baguio City's central business district is a low-density commercial zone over which a large mall or parking lot could not be constructed.

The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.<br><br>3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.<br><br>4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of "substantial compliance" or presence of "special circumstances or compelling reasons".<br><br>5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.<br><br>6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel.
