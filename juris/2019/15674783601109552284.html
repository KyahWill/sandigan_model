Complainant executed an affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> narrating in detail how her own father sexually ravished her.</p> <p> On the witness stand, complainant signified her desire to seek justice for what her father did to her. She testified that the first rape incident happened in March 2007 or days before her graduation from elementary. Appellant raped her in their house at Tagkawayan, Quezon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In 2008, he again raped her in their house in Cruz na Ligas, Quezon City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The third rape incident happened on August 19, 2009, around 4:30 in the morning, also inside their house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This incident is now the subject of the present case.</p><p> Appellant's family lived in the squatters area where houses were separated only by light thin walls.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The house where appellant's family lived measured 5x6 square meters. It was a one room affair. It served as sala, kitchen and bedroom all at the same time. The family slept in the sala. Appellant usually slept near the door; complainant, about two meters from the door; and her mother and youngest sibling, in the middle. Her older brother was not staying with them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p>At the time of the incident, complainant, her brother CCC, and appellant were sleeping in the sala.

When CCC did not respond, she stood up and turned off the light herself. As she walked back to her sleeping area, appellant blocked her way with his foot. He held her hand and directed her to lie down on his "higaan." She obeyed. She did not shout, nor stomp her feet, or knock to catch CCC's attention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p>Appellant removed her t-shirt, shorts, and underwear. She pleaded with him to stop, but he ignored her. He took off his brief, put himself on top of her, and inserted his "ari" in her "ari." She felt intense pain. She did not see him actually insert his penis in her vagina. She tried to push herself up to evade his penetration, but it was in vain. When it was over, he instructed her to cook rice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p>The following day, she left the house to avoid appellant. She went to the workplace of her friend Carmina Morales. She confided to the latter what happened to her and told Carmina she could send appellant to jail for what he did.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Later that day, appellant went to Carmina's place looking for complainant. When Carmina told him complainant was not there, he did not believe her and tried to box her. As a result, both Carmina and appellant went to the barangay office to file their respective complaints against each other while the victim stayed hiding in Carmina's place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p>After Carmina had filed the complaint, she went back to her place and accompanied complainant to the barangay office. The barangay officials summoned complainant's mother. In front of complainant's mother, the barangay officials asked complainant why she left the house. Complainant replied her father was raping her. When complainant's mother heard this, she cried. The barangay officials immediately proceeded to appellant's workplace and arrested him. They took him to Police Station 9 where he got detained pending investigation. Meantime, complainant underwent physical and medical examination at Camp Crame.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Based on the medical examination, attending Doctor PC/Insp.

He only went home around 7 o'clock in the morning. Each time he would go home from work, he would usually be very sleepy and could no longer eat his meal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> The defense did not present any documentary evidence. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Trial Court's Ruling</u></b> </p><p>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated December 3, 2013, the trial court rendered a verdict of conviction, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt as charge(d) in the aforequoted Information, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. Accused is further directed to pay the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.

Appellant essentially argued: (1) Complainant's testimony was hardly straightforward, much less, categorical, thus, casting doubt on the presence of the element of penile penetration; and, complainant's attitude and actions after the alleged rape were inconsistent with the usual actions of a real rape victim, hence, cannot serve to validate complainant's otherwise unreliable testimony.</p><p> On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), through Assistant Solicitor General Marissa Macaraig-Guillen and State Solicitor Jillian Marie B. Co maintained that the prosecution was able to prove with moral certainty that appellant had carnal knowledge of complainant against her will. Her consistent and positive identification of appellant as the man who raped her prevails over appellant's self-serving denial and alibi. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</u></b> </p><p> In its assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated December 23, 2014, the Court of Appeals affirmed, with modification. It found appellant guilty of qualified rape in view of the presence of the qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship. It affirmed the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> but imposed the proviso "without eligibility for parole." </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Present Appeal</u></b> </p><p> Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for his acquittal. In compliance with Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated March 9, 2016, appellant and the People both manifested<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that, in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs filed before the Court of Appeals. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>Issue</u></b> </p><p>Did the Court of Appeals err in convicting appellant of qualified rape? </p><p align="center"><b><u>Ruling</u></b> </p><p>Rape is defined and penalized under article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 8353, <i>viz</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> Art. 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. - Rape is committed -</p> <p> 1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>a) Through force, threat or intimidation;</b> </p> <p>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, </p> <p>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and </p> <p>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.

Complainant positively identified appellant, her own flesh and blood, as the man who had carnal knowledge of her against her will.

The thirteen-year-old complainant could not have merely concocted these ugly details had she not actually experienced them in the hands of her own father. <i>People vs. Balcueva</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> is in point: </p> <blockquote> <p> x x x Verily, a young girl would not concoct a sordid tale of a crime as serious as rape at the hands of her very own father, allow the examination of her private part, and subject herself to the stigma and embarrassment of a public trial, if her motive was other than a fervent desire to seek justice. Hence, there is no plausible reason why AAA would testify against her own father, imputing to him the grave crime of rape, if this crime did not happen. </p> </blockquote> <p> Besides, no child would charge the father she naturally revered and respected with such heinous crime as rape had it not been true. In <em>People v. Mangitngit</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court ordained: </p><blockquote> <p> We reiterate that a rape victim's testimony against her parent is entitled to great weight since Filipino children have a natural reverence and respect for their elders. These values are so deeply ingrained in Filipino families and it is unthinkable for a daughter, or daughters in this case, to brazenly concoct a story of rape against their/her father, if such were not true. </p> </blockquote> <p> As it was, the trial court found complainant's testimony spontaneous and straightforward. The Court respects the trial court's factual findings on complainant's credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> More so because these factual findings carry the full concurrence of the Court of Appeals. </p><p> Appellant, nonetheless, harps on the prosecution's alleged failure to prove penile penetration as an element of carnal knowledge. He zeroes in on complainant's testimony that she did not actually see him insert his penis in her vagina. </p><p> On this score, We reckon with complainant's graphic account "<i>Inilalagay po niya iyong ari niya sa ari ko, ma'am</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> x x x "It was his penis, ma'am. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> x x x "<i>It was very painful</i>. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> If this is not penile penetration, what is? </p><p> While appellant's conviction was primarily based on complainant's testimony, the same solidly conforms with the physical evidence through the medical findings of Dr. Dean Cabrera that complainant sustained hymenal lacerations at 3 and 9 o'clock positions showing blunt penetrating trauma. The Court has consistently ruled that when a rape victim's straightforward and truthful testimony conforms with the medical findings of the examining doctor, the same is sufficient to support a conviction for rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> So must it be.</p><p> Appellant further asserts that complainant's failure to shout for help negates the claim that she got raped. But as held in many cases, the victim's failure to shout for help does not disprove rape. Even the victim's lack of resistance, especially when the sexual predator is her own father, does not signify consent<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>. For in rape cases committed by a close kin, especially by the victim's father himself, the use of actual force or intimidation is unnecessary; moral influence or ascendancy takes the place of violence or intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <i>People v. Dominguez, Jr</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> ordained: </p><blockquote> <p> We find completely understandable AAA's silence and apparent assent to the sexual abuses of her father for a period of time. No standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. <b>More importantly, in incestuous rape cases, the father's abuse of the moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter can subjugate the latter's will thereby forcing her to do whatever he wants. Otherwise stated, the moral and physical dominion of the father is sufficient to cow the victim into submission to his beastly desires. </b>x x x (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>) </p> </blockquote> <p> Notably, although complainant was not able to repel the sexual acts of her father, thereafter, she immediately left the house and reported it first to her friend Carmina, and later to the barangay officials. She also promptly submitted herself to physical examination. Her swift and courageous actions against her own father are eloquent proofs that she was truly wronged and she wanted the wrongdoer to be punished accordingly. </p><p> At any rate, appellant's defenses boil down to denial and alibi. These are the weakest of all defenses - - - easy to contrive but difficult to disprove. As between complainant's credible and positive identification of appellant as the person who had carnal knowledge of her against her will, on one hand, and appellant's bare denial and alibi, on the other, the former indubitably prevails.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 8353,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 266-B.
