				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For a "stop and frisk" search to be valid, the totality of suspicious circumstances, as personally observed by the arresting officer, must lead to a genuine reason to suspect that a person is committing an illicit act. Consequently, a warrantless arrest not based on this constitutes an infringement of a person's basic right to privacy.<p> This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Larry Sabuco Manibog (Manibog) assailing the Court of Appeals July 31, 2013 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and January 29, 2014 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in CA-G.R.

The team slowly approached him for fear that he might fight back. As he moved closer, Chief Inspector Beniat saw a bulge on Manibog's waist, which the police officer deduced to be a gun due to its distinct contour.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> Chief Inspector Beniat went up to Manibog, patted the bulging object on his waist, and confirmed that there was a gun tucked in Manibog's waistband. He disarmed Manibog of the .45 caliber handgun inside a holster, after which he arrested him for violating the election gun ban and brought him to the police station for an inquest proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p>Police Officer Rodel 2 Caraballa (PO2 Caraballa) testified that he was part of the team organized by Chief Inspector Beniat to verify a tip they received concerning Manibog.

Later at the police station, he marked the gun with his initials "RC."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p>For the defense, Manibog did not deny that he was carrying a gun when the police officers arrested him. However, he claimed that while Chief Inspector Beniat was frisking him, the police officer whispered an apology, explaining that he had to do it or he would get in trouble with the police provincial director.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p>Manibog further testified that at the police station, Chief Inspector Beniat asked him to relay his apologies to Dingras Mayor Marinette Gamboa<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Mayor Gamboa) since Manibog had worked closely with her. He also stated that he did not hold a grudge against Chief Inspector Beniat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p>In its August 25, 2011 Judgment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Regional Trial Court found Manibog guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the election offense with which he was charged.

Such reliable information must be combined with an accused's overt act indicating that he or she has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Here, the trial court found that the police officers arrested Manibog not only because of "a very specific"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> tip, but also because they personally observed a distinct bulge on his waistline, which they suspected to be a gun due to its contour and their experience as police officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> The Regional Trial Court likewise brushed off the defense's assertions that the police officers' failure to obtain a warrant invalidated Manibog's search and arrest. It declared that the police officers merely acted befitting the urgency of the situation; they would have been remiss in their duty if they did not immediately act on the information they had received.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Judgment read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the accused LARRY MANIBOG y SABUCO is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the election offense of violation of Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166 in relation to Comelec Resolution No. 8714 and is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from one (1) year and six (6) months as minimum to two (2) years as maximum.

It noted that Manibog had been caught <em>in flagrante delicto</em> and failed to show a permit allowing him to carry his firearm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals July 31, 2013 Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>FOR THE STATED REASONS</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED.</b> </p> <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> Manibog moved for reconsideration, but his Motion was denied in the Court of Appeals January 29, 2014 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p> In his Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Manibog urges this Court to reverse the Court of Appeals Decision validating the police officers' warrantless search and arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner claims that he was not arrested <i>in flagrante delicto</i> because he was only standing in front of the Municipal Tourism Office when the police officers descended upon and searched him. He maintains that the search came prior to his arrest, rendering any evidence obtained from him tainted and inadmissible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p>Petitioner asserts that at the time of his arrest, the police officers could not have seen the contour or bulge of his gun, as it was tucked in his waistband below his navel and could not be seen from a distance. He emphasizes that the police officer who frisked him first patted his back before finding the gun in his waist. This indicates that the police officer was unsure if he actually had a gun on him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner also imputes malice on the police officers, who had earlier received orders to dismantle Mayor Gamboa's private army. As part of her security, he claims that he was singled out and illegally searched and arrested despite merely standing outside a building at that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> respondent People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, insists that the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming petitioner's conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It posits that the warrantless search was done incidental to a lawful arrest as petitioner was arrested while he was committing a crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p>Respondent maintains that the police officers had probable cause to arrest petitioner. It explains that aside from the tip that petitioner was carrying a gun outside the Municipal Tourism Office, the police officers' simple visual inspection confirmed that he had a gun tucked in his waist, which suitably fell under the plain view doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> In his Comment and Opposition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> petitioner insists that there was no probable cause for his warrantless arrest, as he was not committing a crime at that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> He also refutes respondent's assertion that the gun seized from him fell under the plain view doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p>The lone issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not the warrantless search made upon petitioner Larry Sabuco Manibog was unlawful, and, consequently, whether the gun confiscated from him is inadmissible in evidence. </p><p> The Petition must fail. </p><p> Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution provides for the inviolability of a person's right against unreasonable searches and seizures: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. </p> </blockquote> <p> The general rule is that a search and seizure must be carried out through a judicial warrant; otherwise, such search and. seizure violates the Constitution. Any evidence resulting from it "shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p> However, the constitutional proscription only covers <em>unreasonable</em> searches and seizures. Jurisprudence has recognized instances of reasonable warrantless searches and seizures, which are: </p><ol><li><i>Warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest </i>recognized under Section 12, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court and by prevailing jurisprudence;</li><li>Seizure of evidence in "plain view," the elements of which are:</li></ol> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">a prior valid intrusion based on the valid warrantless arrest in which the police are legally present in the pursuit of their official duties; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">the evidence was inadvertently discovered by the police who had the right to be where they are;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">the evidence must be immediately apparent, and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">"plain view" justified mere seizure of evidence without further search;</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <ol start="3"><li> Search of a moving vehicle.

Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> explained that they "differ in terms of the requisite quantum of proof before they may be validly effected and in their allowable scope."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> For an arrest to be lawful, a warrant of arrest must have been judicially issued or there was a lawful warrantless arrest as provided for in Rule 113, Section 5 of the Rules of Court: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 5. Arrest without warrant; when lawful. — A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense; <br> (b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and <br> (c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> For valid warrantless arrests under Section 5(a) and (b), the arresting officer must have personal knowledge of the offense. The difference is that under Section 5(a), the arresting officer must have personally witnessed the crime; meanwhile, under Section 5(b), the arresting officer must have had probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested committed an offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Nonetheless, whether under Section 5(a) or (b), the lawful arrest generally precedes,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> or is substantially contemporaneous,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> with the search. </p><p> In direct contrast with warrantless searches incidental to a lawful arrest, stop and frisk searches are conducted to deter crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <em>People v. Cogaed</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> underscored that they are necessary for law enforcement, though never at the expense of violating a citizen's right to privacy: </p><blockquote> <p> "Stop and frisk" searches (sometimes referred to as Terry searches) are necessary for law enforcement. That is, law enforcers should be given the legal arsenal to prevent the commission of offenses. However, this should be balanced with the need to protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. </p> <p> The balance lies in the concept of "suspiciousness" present in the situation where the police officer finds himself or herself in. This may be undoubtedly based on the experience of the police officer. Experienced police officers have personal experience dealing with criminals and criminal behavior. Hence, they should have the ability to discern — based on facts that they themselves observe — whether an individual is acting in a suspicious manner. Clearly, a basic criterion would be that the police officer, with his or her personal knowledge, must observe the facts leading to the suspicion of an illicit act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Posadas v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> saw this Court uphold the warrantless search and seizure done as a valid stop and frisk search. There, the accused's suspicious actions, coupled with his attempt to flee when the police officers introduced themselves to him, amounted to a reasonable suspicion that he was concealing something illegal in his buri bag.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> However, <em>Posadas</em> failed to elaborate on or describe what the police officers observed as the suspicious act that led them to search the accused's buri bag. </p><p> In comparison, the police officers in <i>Manalili v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> responded to a report that drug addicts were roaming in front of the Kalookan City Cemetery. There, they saw a man with bloodshot eyes who had trouble walking straight.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This Court upheld the validity of the warrantless arrest as a stop and frisk search, since the police officers' observation and assessment led them to believe that the man was high on drugs and compelled them to investigate and search him. </p><p> Similarly, in <i>People v. Solayao</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> police officers were investigating reports that a group of armed men was roaming the barangay at night. As they patrolled the streets, they saw seemingly drunk men, among them Solayao in a camouflage uniform. The men fled upon seeing the police, but Solayao was caught and found with an unlicensed firearm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This Court upheld the validity of the warrantless search and seizure conducted as a stop and frisk search, since the unfolding events did not leave the police officers enough time to procure a search warrant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> <em>Manalili </em>and<em> Solayao</em> upheld the warrantless searches conducted because "the police officers[,] using their senses[,] observed facts that led to the suspicion."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Furthermore, the totality of the circumstances in each case provided sufficient and genuine reason for them to suspect that something illicit was afoot. </p><p> For a valid stop and frisk search, the arresting officer must have had personal knowledge of facts, which would engender a reasonable degree of suspicion of an illicit act. <i>Cogaed</i> emphasized that anything less than the arresting officer's personal observation of a suspicious circumstance as basis for the search is an infringement of the "basic right to security of one's person and effects."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> <i>Malacat</i> instructed that for a stop and frisk search to be valid, mere suspicion is not enough; there should be a genuine reason, as determined by the police officer, to warrant a belief that the person searched was carrying a weapon. In short, the totality of circumstances should result in a genuine reason to justify a stop and frisk search. </p><p> In <i>Esquillo v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the police officer approached and searched the accused after seeing her put a clear plastic sachet in her cigarette case and try to flee from him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This Court upheld the validity of the stop and frisk search conducted, since the police officer's experience led him to reasonably suspect that the plastic sachet with white crystalline substance in the cigarette case was a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> In his dissent in <em>Esquillo</em>, however, then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin (Chief Justice Bersamin) pointed out how the police officer admitted that only his curiosity upon seeing the accused put a plastic sachet in her cigarette case prompted him to approach her. This was despite not seeing what was in it, as he was standing three (3) meters away from her at that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The dissent read: </p><blockquote> <p> For purposes of a valid Terry stop-and-frisk search, the test for the existence of reasonable suspicion that a person is engaged in criminal activity is the totality of the circumstances, viewed through the eyes of a reasonable, prudent police officer. Yet, the totality of the circumstances described by PO1 Cruzin did not suffice to engender any reasonable suspicion in his mind. The petitioner's act, without more, was an innocuous movement, absolutely not one to give rise in the mind of an experienced officer to any belief that she had any weapon concealed about her, or that she was probably committing a crime in the presence of the officer. Neither should her act and the surrounding circumstances engender any reasonable suspicion on the part of the officer that a criminal activity was afoot. We should bear in mind that the Court has frequently struck down the arrest of individuals whose overt acts did not transgress the penal laws, or were wholly innocent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Chief Justice Bersamin cautioned against warrantless searches based on just one (1) suspicious circumstance. There should have been "more than one seemingly innocent activity, which, taken together, warranted a reasonable inference of criminal activity"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> to uphold the validity of a stop and frisk search. </p><p> Accordingly, to sustain the validity of a stop and frisk search, the arresting officer should have personally observed two (2) or more suspicious circumstances, the totality of which would then create a reasonable inference of criminal activity to compel the arresting officer to investigate further. </p><p> Here, while the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that a reasonable search was conducted on petitioner, the facts on record do not point to a warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest. Rather, what transpired was a stop and frisk search. </p><p> Chief Inspector Beniat received information that petitioner, whom he knew as a kagawad and security aide of Mayor Gamboa, was carrying a gun outside the Municipal Tourism Office during an election gun ban. With a few other police officers, he went there and spotted petitioner right in front of the building with a suspicious-looking bulge protruding under his shirt, around his waist. The police officer deduced this to be a firearm based on the object's size and contour.

Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the search conducted on petitioner fell under the established exception of a warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest. </p> <p> Nonetheless, the combination of the police asset's tip and the arresting officers' observation of a gun-shaped object under petitioner's shirt already suffices as a genuine reason for the arresting officers to conduct a stop and frisk search on petitioner. Hence, the trial court correctly upheld the reasonableness of the warrantless search on petitioner: </p><blockquote> <p> In the present case, the Dingras policemen searched the accused not only because of a tip - a very specific one - that he was at that moment standing in front of the nearby Municipal Tourism Office with a gun on his waist. More importantly, PCI Beniat testified that at a distance of about two to three meters from the accused, he saw the latter's bulging waistline indicating the "distinct peculiar contour" of a firearm tucked on his waist. Citing his experience as a police officer, PCI Beniat testified that he could distinguish a firearm from any other object tucked on the waist of a person. In the language of Justice Panganiban's separate opinion in<i> People v. Montilla</i>, the Court finds that the bulging waistline of herein accused constituted "an outward indication" that clearly suggested he was then carrying a firearm. </p> <p> It should be noted that the firearm recovered from the accused was an ARMSCOR <u>full-size</u> 1911 pistol (GI series) with an overall length of 8.5 inches and a barrel length of 5 inches. Not being a compact pistol, its size made it difficult to conceal. Conceivably, it could be concealed under appropriate clothes like a jacket or an additional piece of clothing. In this case, however, PO1 Caravalla (sic) testified that the accused was at the time of his apprehension merely wearing a white shirt depicted in his photograph at the police station. In other words, the accused was not wearing a jacket or any additional garment that could have masked the contour of a full-sized pistol. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that the size of the pistol and the absence of any other clothing worn by the accused during his apprehension support the testimony of PCI Beniat that his (the accused Larry Manibog's) waistline was then bulging in a manner suggestive of the presence of a firearm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Finally, the Regional Trial Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, correctly found petitioner guilty of committing an election offense. It imposed the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of one (1) year and six (6) months as minimum, and two (2) years as maximum, which finds basis in Section 264 of the Omnibus Election Code: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 264. Penalties. — Any person found guilty of any election offense under this Code <em>shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than one year but not more than six years and shall not be subject to probation. </em>In addition, the guilty party shall be sentenced to suffer disqualification to hold public office and deprivation of the right of suffrage. If he is a foreigner, he shall be sentenced to deportation which shall be enforced after the prison term has been served. Any political party found guilty shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than ten thousand pesos, which shall be imposed upon such party after criminal action has been instituted in which their corresponding officials have been found guilty. . . . </p> <p> In case of prisoner or prisoners illegally released from any penitentiary or jail during the prohibited period as provided in Section 261, paragraph (n) of this Code, the director of prisons, provincial warden, keeper of the jail or prison, or persons who are required by law to keep said prisoner in their custody shall, if convicted by a competent court, be sentenced to suffer the penalty of<em> prision mayor </em>in its maximum period if the prisoner or prisoners so illegally released commit any act of intimidation, terrorism of interference in the election. . . . </p> <p> Any person found guilty of the offense of failure to register or failure to vote shall, upon conviction, be fined one hundred pesos. In addition, he shall suffer disqualification to run for public office in the next succeeding election following his conviction or be appointed to a public office for a period of one year following his conviction. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Nonetheless, as petitioner is legally disqualified to apply for probation under Section 264 of the Omnibus Election Code, the penalty should be modified to reflect this. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit. Petitioner Larry Sabuco Manibog is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from one (1) year and six (6) months as minimum to two (2) years as maximum, and is <b>DISQUALIFIED</b> from applying for probation.
