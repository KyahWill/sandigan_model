PPC availed of the correct remedy. </p><p> Rule 41 provides the rules regarding appeal from the Regional Trial Courts. Section 1 of Rule 41 provides what judgments or orders are subject of appeal and those where no appeal may be taken from, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 1. Subject of appeal. - An appeal may be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by these Rules to be appealable. </p> <p> <b>No appeal may be taken from</b>: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) An order denying a petition for relief or any similar motion seeking relief from judgment;</p> <p> (b) An interlocutory order; </p> <p>(c) An order disallowing or dismissing an appeal; </p> <p>(d) An order denying a motion to set aside a judgment by consent, confession or compromise on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress, or any other ground vitiating consent;</p> <p> (e) An order of execution; </p> <p>(f) A judgment or final order for or against one or more of several parties or in separate claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party complaints, while the main case is pending, unless the court allows an appeal therefrom; and </p> <p>(g) <b>An order dismissing an action without prejudice.</b></p> </blockquote> <p> <b>In any of the foregoing circumstances, the aggrieved party may file an appropriate special civil action as provided in Rule 65</b>. (<i>As amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, December 1, 2007</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> An order dismissing an action without prejudice is, thus, not subject to appeal but is reviewable by a Rule 65 <em>certiorari</em> petition. </p><p> In <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Carpio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court made these pronouncements on the nature of an order of dismissal based on improper venue and the mode of its review: </p><blockquote> <p> In this case, there was no trial on the merits as <u>the case was dismissed due to improper venue and respondents could not have appealed the order of dismissal as the same was a dismissal, <b><i>without prejudice</i></b></u>. Section 1(h), Rule 41 of the Rules of Civil Procedure states that no appeal may be taken from an order dismissing an action without prejudice. Indeed, there is no residual jurisdiction to speak of where no appeal has even been filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p> <p> In <i>Strongworld Construction Corporation, et al. v. Hon. Perello, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court elucidated on the difference between a dismissal with prejudice and one without prejudice:</p> <blockquote> <p> We distinguish a dismissal <i>with</i> prejudice from a dismissal <i>without</i> prejudice. The former disallows and bars the refiling of the complaint; whereas, the same cannot be said of a dismissal without prejudice. Likewise, where the law permits, a dismissal with prejudice is subject to the right of appeal. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p>Section 1, Rule 16 of the [Rules] enumerates the grounds for which a motion to dismiss may be filed, <em>viz</em>.: </p> <p> Section 1. Grounds. Within the time for but before filling the answer to the complaint or pleading asserting a claim, a motion to dismiss may be made on any of the following grounds: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">That the court has no jurisdiction over the person of the defending party;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That venue is improperly laid; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(e)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(f)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(g)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That the pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(h)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That the claim or demand set forth; in the plaintiff[']s pleading has been paid, waived, abandoned, or otherwise extinguished;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(i)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of the statute of frauds; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(j)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That a condition precedent for filing the claim has not been complied with. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Section 5 of the same Rule, recites the effect of a dismissal under Sections 1(f), (h), and (i), thereof, thus: </p> <p> SEC. 5. <i>Effect of dismissal</i>. Subject to the right of appeal, an order granting a motion to dismiss based on paragraphs (f), (h), and (i) of Section 1 hereof shall bar the refiling of the same action or claim. </p> </blockquote> <p> Briefly stated, dismissals that are based on the following grounds, to wit: (1) that the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations; (2) that the claim or demand set forth in the plaintiff[']s pleading has been paid, waived, abandoned or otherwise extinguished; and (3) that the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of the statute of frauds, bar the refiling of the same action or claim. Logically, the nature of the dismissal founded on any of the preceding grounds is with prejudice because the dismissal prevents the refiling of the same action or claim. Ergo, dismissals based on the rest of the grounds enumerated are without prejudice because they do not preclude the refiling of the same action. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p>As has been earlier quoted, Section 1(h), Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that no appeal may be taken from an order dismissing an action without prejudice. The same section provides that in such an instan[ce] where the final order is not appealable, the aggrieved party may file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> <p> Here, the RTC dismissed the replevin case on the ground of improper venue. Such dismissal is one <em>without prejudice</em> and does not bar the refiling of the same action; hence, it is not appealable. Clearly, the RTC did not reach, and could not have reached, the residual jurisdiction stage as the case was dismissed due to improper venue, and such order of dismissal could not be the subject of an appeal. Without the perfection of an appeal, let alone the unavailability of the remedy of appeal, the RTC did not acquire residual jurisdiction. Hence, it is erroneous to conclude that the RTC may rule on DBP's application for damages pursuant to its residual powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>United Alloy Philippines Corp. v. United Coconut Planters Bank</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court emphasized that the dismissal of the complaint based on the grounds of improper venue, forum-shopping and for being a harassment suit, which do not fall under paragraphs (f), (h) or (i) of Section 1, Rule 16, is a dismissal without prejudice; and the remedy available to the plaintiff is a Rule 65 petition inasmuch as only dismissals based on the grounds under paragraphs (f), (h) or (i) of Section 1, Rule 16 are subject to appeal, the re-filing of the same action or claim being barred, pursuant to Section 5, Rule 16. </p><p> Indeed, appeal is not available as a remedy to question either the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss based on improper venue. If the motion is denied, the order of denial is interlocutory since it does not completely dispose of the case and is not appealable under Section 1(b), Rule 41 of the Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> If the motion is granted, the order of dismissal is one without prejudice since the complaint can be re-filed and is not appealable under Section 1(g) of Rule 41.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Consequently, PPC availed of the correct remedy of <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 65 of the Rules. </p><p> Nonetheless, PPC's Petition must fail because it has not convinced the Court that the RTC acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing its Complaint for improper venue. </p><p> To recall, the grounds relied upon by PPC in its Petition for <em>Certiorari</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated November 29, 2011 which it filed before the CA were: </p><ol start="" type="I"><li> PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION, AMOUNTING TO LACK OF AND/OR EXCESS IN JURISDICTION, IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THAT THE AGREED VENUE OF ACTION APPLIED ONLY TO [PPC] AND [CCC];<br><br></li><li>PUBLIC RESPONDENT GRAVELY ABUSED HIS DISCRETION, AMOUNTING TO LACK OF AND/OR EXCESS IN JURISDICTION, IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THAT [PGIC] IS AN INDISPENSABLE PARTY IN THE CASE AND THAT [PPC] HAD SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST IT; and <br><br></li><li>EVEN ASSUMING THAT VENUE WAS IMPROPERLY LAID AS FAR AS [CCC] IS CONCERNED, THE CASE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS AGAINST [PGIC].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </li></ol> <p> In essence, PPC was arguing that the stipulation on venue in case of an action in the Contract did not apply in this case because the inclusion of PGIC, a non-party thereto, made the general rule on venue applicable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Since the RTC applied the exclusive venue rule, PPC took the position that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack and/or excess of jurisdiction. </p><p> Section 2, Rule 4 of the Rules sets forth the general rule regarding the venue of personal actions: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 2. <i>Venue of personal actions</i>. — All other actions may be commenced and tried where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants resides, or in the case of a non-resident defendant where he may be found, at the election of the plaintiff. (2[b]a)</p> </blockquote> <p> The exceptions are provided in Section 4, Rule 4, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 4. <i>When Rule not applicable</i>. - This Rule shall not apply -</p> <p> (a) In those cases where a specific rule or law provides otherwise; or</p> <p> (b) Where the parties have validly agreed in writing before the filing of the action on the exclusive venue thereof. (3a, 5a) </p> </blockquote> <p> To recall, the RTC applied Section 4(b) of Rule 4 on exclusive venue since the Contract of PPC and CCC provides "<b>that in case of litigation, the parties hereby agree that the venue of said action as the Proper Court of Makati to the exclusion of others</b>," and not the general rule on venue which is the place of residence of plaintiff or defendant at the election of plaintiff under Section 2 of Rule 4.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> In order to determine whether the RTC's application of Section 4(b) instead of Section 2 of Rule 4 constitutes grave abuse of discretion to warrant the availing of a Rule 65 <em>certiorari</em> petition to nullify it, <i>Sps. Crisologo v. JEWM Agro-Industrial Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> is instructive, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> The trial court should have exercised prudence in denying Spouses Crisologo's pleas to be recognized as indispensable parties [in the case for cancellation of lien]. In the words of the Court, "Judge Omelio should be penalized for failing to recognize Sps. Crisologo as indispensable parties and for requiring them to file a motion to intervene, considering that a simple perusal of the certificates of title would show Sps. Crisologo's adverse rights because their liens are annotated at the back of the titles."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p> <p> This manifest disregard of the basic rules and procedures constitutes a grave abuse of discretion. </p> <p> In <i>State Prosecutors II Comilang and Lagman v. Judge Medel Belen</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court held as inexcusable abuse of authority the trial judge's "obstinate disregard of basic and established rule of law or procedure." Such level of ignorance is not a mere error of judgment. It amounts to "evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> or in essence, grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. </p> <p> Needless to say, judges are expected to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural laws. They must know the laws and apply them properly in good faith as judicial competence requires no less.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Even on the assumption that the RTC erred in its determination of the proper venue in this case, the Court is not persuaded that the RTC manifestly disregarded the basic rules and procedures or acted with obstinate disregard of basic and established rule of law or procedure. If at all, the error of the RTC, assuming there was any, was a mere error of judgment which did not constitute grave abuse of discretion. </p><p> Given the stipulation on venue in the Contract, where exclusivity is provided, the RTC had enough legal basis to apply Section 4(b), Rule 4 and not Section 2, Rule 4. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <strong>PARTLY GRANTED</strong>.
