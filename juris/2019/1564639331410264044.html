				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The degree of freedom by which journalists operate to uncover and write the news is an indication of the current state of our country's democracy. By freely obtaining vital information on matters of public concern, citizens become socially aware and well-equipped to participate in different political processes to exercise their rights enshrined in the fundamental law. Journalists are the sentinels who keep watch over the actions of the government. They are the eyes and ears of the citizenry. In today's digital age, the work of journalists is held to a higher standard more than ever. Beyond the multitude that participate on social media, they have value as part of a profession that should be trusted with the truth.<br><br>Nevertheless, the probing done by journalists must be made "with good motives and for justifiable ends[.]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The protection afforded by the Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to the press is not carte blanche that allows journalists to abandon their responsibility for truth and transparency.

Tadeo, Jr.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Generally, the basis of civil liability arising from crime is the fundamental postulate of our law that "Every man criminally liable is also civilly liable" (Art. 100, The Revised Penal Code). Underlying this legal principle is the traditional theory that when a person commits a crime he offends two entities namely (1) the society in which he lives in or the political entity called the State whose law he had violated; and (2) the individual member of that society whose person, right, honor, chastity or property was actually or directly injured or damaged by the same punishable act or omission. . . . While an act or omission is felonious because it is punishable by law, it gives rise to civil liability not so much because it is a crime but because it caused damage to another. Viewing things pragmatically, we can readily see that what gives rise to the civil liability is really the obligation and the moral duty of everyone to repair or make whole the damage caused to another by reason of his own act or omission, done intentionally or negligently, whether or not the same be punishable by law. In other words, criminal liability will give rise to civil liability only if the same felonious act or omission results in damage or injury to another and is the direct and proximate cause thereof. Damage or injury to another is evidently the foundation of the civil action. Such is not the case in criminal actions for, to be criminally liable, it is enough that the act or omission complained of is punishable, regardless of whether or not it also causes material damage to another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Nevertheless, the private offended party's interest in a criminal case is limited to the civil liability arising from it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It is a fundamental principle in remedial law that if the trial court dismisses the case or renders a judgment of acquittal, the private offended party cannot appeal the criminal aspect of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Only the Office of the Solicitor General can represent the State in actions brought before the Court of Appeals or this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In <i>People v. Santiago:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>It is well-settled that in criminal cases where the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited to the civil liability. </i>Thus, in the prosecution of the offense, the complainant's role is limited to that of a witness for the prosecution. <i>If a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal therefrom on the criminal aspect may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General. </i>Only the Solicitor General may represent the People of the Philippines on appeal. <i>The private offended party or complainant may not take such appeal. However, the said offended party or complainant may appeal the civil aspect despite the acquittal of the accused.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Similarly, in <i>Malayan Insurance Company, Inc. v. Piccio:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, jurisprudence holds that if there is a dismissal of a criminal case by the trial court or if there is an acquittal of the accused, it is only the OSG that may bring an appeal on the criminal aspect representing the People. The rationale therefor is rooted in the principle that the party affected by the dismissal of the criminal action is the People and not the petitioners who are mere complaining witnesses. For this reason, the People are therefore deemed as the real parties in interest in the criminal case and, therefore, only the OSG can represent them in criminal proceedings pending in the CA or in this Court. In view of the corollary principle that every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or by the party entitled to the avails of the suit, an appeal of the criminal case not filed by the People as represented by the OSG is perforce dismissible. <i>The private complainant or the offended party may, however, file an appeal without the intervention of the OSG but only insofar as the civil liability of the accused is concerned. </i>He may also file a special civil action for certiorari even without the intervention of the OSG, but only to the end of preserving his interest in the civil aspect of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Here, petitioner's sole purpose is to question the amount of damages awarded by the Court of Appeals.

Courts are given the discretion to fix the amount to be awarded in favor of the injured party, so long as there is sufficient basis for awarding such amount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner insists that he is entitled to moral damages in the amount of P5,000,000.00. He argues that he suffered social humiliation and anxiety from the libelous article. His 77-year-old mother castigated him for disgracing their family. His children questioned him after they had been interrogated in school for the article about their father.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Finally, petitioner claims that the article tainted his reputation, prompting his clients and business associates to refuse to transact with him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>While this Court recognizes the embarrassment and unease suffered by petitioner, it must be emphasized that moral damages may only be awarded when the claimant has sufficiently proved: (1) the factual foundation of the award; and (2) the causal connection of petitioner's suffering to respondents' act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> In <i>Kierulf v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br><blockquote>This Court cannot remind the bench and the bar often enough that in order that moral damages may be awarded, there must be pleading and proof of moral suffering, mental anguish, fright and the like. <i><b>While no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral damages may be awarded, the amount of indemnity being left to the discretion of the court, it is nevertheless essential that the claimant should satisfactorily show the existence of the factual basis of damages and its causal connection to defendant's acts. </b></i>This is so because moral damages, though incapable of pecuniary estimation, are in the category of an award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered and not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer. In <i>Francisco vs. GSIS, </i>the Court held that there must be clear testimony on the anguish and other forms of mental suffering. Thus, if the plaintiff fails to take the witness stand and testify as to his/her social humiliation, wounded feelings and anxiety, moral damages cannot be awarded. In <i>Cocoland Development Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, </i>the Court held that "additional facts must be pleaded and proven to warrant the grant of moral damages under the Civil Code, these being, . . . social humiliation, wounded feelings, grave anxiety, etc., that resulted therefrom."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>In <i>Mendoza v. Spouses Gomez,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> this Court disallowed the award of moral damages to the respondents. It ruled that they failed to allege and present "evidence of besmirched reputation or physical, mental[,] or psychological suffering incurred by them."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>Quezon City Government v. Dacara,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> this Court deleted the award of moral damages after finding that the respondent had failed to adduce proof of the emotional and mental sufferings he experienced due to the petitioners' negligent act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Here, other than his bare allegations of besmirched reputation and loss of clientele, petitioner failed to present evidence supporting his assertions. He submitted no evidence substantiating his claimed loss. He also failed to adduce proof to support his claim that his reputation was tainted due to the libelous article. Moreover, he did not present in court any testimony from the business associates who had allegedly lost faith in him. Indeed, as the Court of Appeals found, the client, whom he had supposedly lost due to the libelous article, has been transacting business with him again.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, moral damages should still be awarded. As he had testified during trial, members of his family were displeased with him for being accused of committing illegal and corrupt acts. He was berated by his mother Tor having humiliated their family. His children were questioned at school. As such, an award of P500,000.00 as moral damages is an adequate recompense to the mental anguish and wounded feelings that petitioner had endured.<br><br><center><b>IV</b></center><br><br>The Court of Appeals deleted the award of exemplary damages and ruled that under Article 2230 of the Civil Code, exemplary damages may be awarded only when the crime was committed with one (1) or more aggravating circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the Court of Appeals' pronouncement, exemplary damages may be awarded even in the absence of aggravating circumstances.

However, it cannot be recovered as a matter of right. It is based entirely on the discretion of the court. Jurisprudence sets certain requirements before exemplary damages may be awarded, to wit:<br><br>(1) (T)hey may be imposed by way of example or correction only in addition, among others, to compensatory damages, and cannot be recovered as a matter of right, their determination depending upon the amount of compensatory damages that may be awarded to the claimant;<br><br>(2) the claimant must first establish his right to moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages; and<br><br>(3) the wrongful act must be accompanied by bad faith, and the award would be allowed only if the guilty party acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> (Citations omitted) </blockquote><br><br>Here, respondents published the libelous article without verifying the truth of the allegations against petitioner. As the Court of Appeals found, the Revenue Integrity Protection Service only investigates officials of the Department of Finance and its attached agencies who are accused of corruption. Petitioner, on the other hand, is no government official and, therefore, beyond the Revenue Integrity Protection Service's jurisdiction. It only goes to show that respondents did not verify the information on which the article was based.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Thus, to ensure that such conduct will no longer be repeated, and considering their profession, respondents are directed to pay petitioner exemplary damages in the amount of P1,000,000.00.<br><br><center><b>V</b></center><br><br>Among the advantages brought by modern technology is the ease by which news can be shared and disseminated through different social media outlets. News matters are now simultaneously cascaded in real-time. Society is swamped with a myriad of information involving a wide array of topics.

Occurrences across the globe, or the lack thereof, are immediately subject of the news written by journalists.<br><br>More often than not, journalists are at the forefront of information publication and dissemination. Owing to the nature of their work, they have the prerogative to shape the news as they see fit. This Court does not turn a blind eye to some of them who twist the news to give an ambiguous interpretation that is in reckless disregard of the truth.<br><br>Crafting inaccurate and misleading news is a blatant violation of the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics.
