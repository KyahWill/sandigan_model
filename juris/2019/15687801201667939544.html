It stressed that minor deviations from the legally mandated procedure were not fatal to the prosecution's case, when the lapses could be explained by justifiable grounds. It, likewise, underscored that without contrary evidence, police officers enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused RICARDO VERIÑO y PINGOL @ RICKY guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged of possession of three (3) plastic sachets of shabu, with a total weight of 0.12 grams, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum to fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and to pay a <b>FINE</b> of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php300,000.00).

Moreover, it asserts that this Court should respect the consistent factual findings of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, respondent insists that the prosecution proved the identity and integrity of the three (3) sachets seized from petitioner through an unbroken chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It also asserts that the prosecution proved petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not the prosecution proved petitioner Ricardo Veriño y Pingol @ "Ricky"'s guilt beyond reasonable doubt despite its failure to show strict compliance with the required procedure under Section 21 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended.<br><br>To substantiate an accusation of illegal possession of a dangerous drug, the prosecution must show that:<br><blockquote>(1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug. Similarly, in this case, the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> must be established beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>As to the <i>corpus delicti</i>, Section 21 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 10640, imposes the following requirements for the manner of custody and disposition of confiscated, seized, and/or surrendered drugs, and/or drug paraphernalia prior to the filing of a criminal case:<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <i>Provided</i>, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items[;]</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued immediately upon the receipt of the subject item/s: <i>Provided</i>, That when the volume of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a final certification shall be issued immediately upon completion of the said examination and certification[.]<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>These established precautions in the handling of seized dangerous drugs are needed since narcotic substances are not easily identifiable and are prone to alteration or tampering. The chain of custody, as a method of authenticating a dangerous drug presented as evidence, ensures that the identity of the seized drugs will not be put in doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>When it comes to Section 21, this Court has repeatedly stated that the handling officers must observe strict compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> to guarantee the integrity and identity of seized drug. Thus, acts that "approximate compliance but do not strictly comply with Section 21 have been considered insufficient."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, while strict compliance is the expected standard, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act recognized that it may not always be possible in every situation. Hence, the law's Implementing Rules and Regulations introduced a saving clause, which was eventually incorporated in Section 21 when the law was amended by Republic Act No. 10640. The saving clause reads:<br><blockquote><i>Provided, finally</i>, that noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items.<br></blockquote>The saving clause may be appreciated in the prosecution's favor if noncompliance with Section 21 was justified and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized dangerous drug were preserved. Thus, the prosecution has the burden of explaining why Section 21 was not strictly complied with<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and proving its proffered justifiable ground during trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In <i>People v. Umipang</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote>Minor deviations from the procedures under R.A. 9165 would not automatically exonerate an accused from the crimes of which he or she was convicted. This is especially true when the lapses in procedure were "recognized and explained in terms of justifiable grounds." There must also be a showing "that the police officers intended to comply with the procedure but were thwarted by some justifiable consideration/reason." However, when there is gross disregard of the procedural safeguards prescribed in the substantive law (R.A. 9165), serious uncertainty is generated about the identity of the seized items that the prosecution presented in evidence. This uncertainty cannot be remedied by simply invoking the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, for a gross, systematic, or deliberate disregard of the procedural safeguards effectively produces an irregularity in the performance of official duties. As a result, the prosecution is deemed to have failed to fully establish the elements of the crimes charged, creating reasonable doubt on the criminal liability of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, an inventory<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the items seized from petitioner was prepared by SPO3 Sanchez, the investigating officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> However, despite the clear requirements under Section 21, the inventory was only witnessed by an elected public official. The prosecution failed to explain why the inventory was not signed by petitioner or his representative and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media, as mandated by law.<br><br>When the Regional Trial Court asked why only the elected public official signed the inventory, PO1 Verde explained that he did not prepare the inventory and was in no position to know the protocol behind the inventory of items seized from operations. He added that SPO3 Sanchez should know the protocol for inventory-taking since he prepared the inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, the prosecution never presented SPO3 Sanchez as its witness.<br><br>Another lapse was the prosecution's failure to present a photograph of the inventory, despite PO1 Verde's testimony that at least two (2) people took photos during the inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Again, the prosecution failed to explain this blatant noncompliance with Section 21.<br><br>Nonetheless, despite the glaring lapses committed by the police officers, the Court of Appeals,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> as well as the Regional Trial Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> did not deem them fatal to the prosecution's case, reasoning that the prosecution has established all the links in the chain of custody, and that the police officers enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.<br><br>The Court of Appeals is mistaken.<br><br><i>People v. Holgado</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> warns that the danger of tampering with and planting evidence is inversely proportional to the amount of dangerous drug seized. A minuscule amount of dangerous drug magnifies the probability of planting, tampering, or contaminating evidence, which explains the need for exacting compliance with Section 21:<br><blockquote>While the miniscule amount of narcotics seized is by itself not a ground for acquittal, this circumstance underscores the need for more exacting compliance with Section 21. In <i>Mallillin v. People</i>, this court said that "the likelihood of tampering, loss or mistake with respect to an exhibit is greatest when the exhibit is small and is one that has physical characteristics fungible in nature and similar in form to substances familiar to people in their daily lives."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>Here, the prosecution claimed that the police officers recovered three (3) sachets of shabu from petitioner, with one (1) sachet containing 0.02 gram and the other two (2) sachets containing 0.05 gram each. These minuscule amounts should have prompted the lower courts to demand from the police officers strict compliance with the legal safeguards under Section 21, instead of allowing the prosecution to misguidedly seek refuge under the saving clause and the presumption of regularity accorded to State agents.<br><br>It has not escaped this Court's attention that the prosecution did not even bother to proffer a justifiable cause for the lapses. Nonetheless, its indifference to the legal safeguards was rewarded by the lower courts, which ruled that despite noncompliance, the prosecution proved the integrity and identity of the seized sachets.<br><br>The lower courts are mistaken. The unjustified noncompliance with Section 21 creates a substantial gap in the chain of custody and casts doubt on the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. <i>Mariñas v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> explained:<br><blockquote>There is no question that the prosecution miserably failed to provide justifiable grounds for the arresting officers' non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as well as the IRR. <i>The unjustified absence of an elected public official and DOJ representative during the inventory of the seized item constitutes a substantial gap in the chain of custody.</i> There being a substantial gap or break in the chain, it casts serious doubts on the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. As such, the petitioner must be acquitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The gaps in the chain of custody created by the unexplained lapses cannot be remedied by a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, as the lapses themselves are clear proof of irregularity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty "stands only when no reason exists in the records by which to doubt the regularity of the performance of official duty. And even in that instance the presumption of regularity will not be stronger than the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Notably, there were noticeable discrepancies between the prosecution witnesses' testimonies and the prosecution's documentary evidence. PO1 Verde testified that at around 5:00 p.m. of April 4, 2014, he received a tip from a concerned citizen about petitioner's illegal activities in Marulas Public Market. Yet, the Coordination Form<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> filled out by PO3 Fabreag for the surveillance on petitioner was prepared at 3:20 p.m. that same day, a good two (2) hours before PO1 Verde supposedly received the information on petitioner.

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty.
