physician&nbsp; had already assessed his disability at Grade 10 pursuant to the POEA-SEC; Buico failed to follow the third doctor rule; the company-designated&nbsp; physician had knowledge of Buico's actual medical condition, hence, he was more qualified to assess his disability and his assessment should be upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>The Ruling of the LA</i><br><br>In a Decision <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp;

findings,&nbsp; ruling that the referral to a third doctor was not mandatory and that the findings of the company-designated physician and the seafarer's doctor&nbsp;&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; inconclusive&nbsp;&nbsp; because&nbsp;&nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp; still&nbsp;&nbsp; had&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; weighed&nbsp;&nbsp; and considered&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; labor&nbsp; tribunals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; NLRC&nbsp; ruled&nbsp; that&nbsp; the company-designated&nbsp; physician's assessment was not accurate and precise, pointing&nbsp; out&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; company-designated&nbsp; physician&nbsp; even&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; in the Final Medical Report that Buico was not restored to his previous condition, hence, his disability should therefore be considered as total and permanent<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Resolution reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the appeal of [Buico] is <b>GRANTED</b>.

Aggrieved, petitioners filed the instant Petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court before the Court.<br><br>On July 31, 2017, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> requiring Buico to file&nbsp; a Comment&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; instant&nbsp; Petition.&nbsp; Subsequently,&nbsp; in a July&nbsp; 9, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; the Court noted that Buico's&nbsp; counsel, Atty.

Taggueg to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily&nbsp; dealt with or held in contempt for such failure and to comply with the July 31, 2017 Resolution. On March 4, 2019, the Court again issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; which required the filing of a comment and imposed a fine of P1,000.00 'upon Atty. Taggueg for his failure to comply with the show cause resolution. Since the Court has not received Buico's Comment&nbsp; despite the issued Resolutions&nbsp; requiring the filing of the same, the Court shall dispense with the filing of the Comment&nbsp; and now resolve the controversy based on the Petition and the existing records.<br><br><div align="center"><i><b>Issue</b></i><br></div><br>The main issue in the case at bar is whether Buico is entitled to the award of total and permanent disability benefits.<br><br><div align="center"><b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b><br></div><br>The instant Petition is meritorious.<br><br>At the&nbsp; outset,&nbsp; it is important&nbsp; to note that a Rule&nbsp; 45 review&nbsp; by this Court in labor cases generally does not delve into factual questions or to an evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> However,&nbsp;&nbsp; one exception to this rule is when the judgment is based on a misapprehension&nbsp; of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Such exception applies in the instant case because, contrary to the findings of the NLRC and the CA, the company-designated physician&nbsp; had issued a final, accurate, and precise disability grading within the prescribed statutory&nbsp; periods.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; Buico&nbsp; is no&nbsp;&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; award&nbsp; of&nbsp; total&nbsp; and permanent disability benefits.<br><br>It is&nbsp; settled&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; seafarer's entitlement&nbsp; to&nbsp; disability&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; is governed by law, the parties' contracts, and by medical findings. Since Buico was employed in 2013, the procedure to be observed in claiming disability benefits is outlined in Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS </b><br><br><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS</b><br><br>The&nbsp; liabilities&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; employer&nbsp; when &nbsp; the&nbsp; seafarer&nbsp; suffers&nbsp; work-related injury or illness during the term of his&nbsp;&nbsp; contract are as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x However,&nbsp; if after repatriation,&nbsp; the seafarer&nbsp; still requires medical attention arising from said injury or illness, be shall&nbsp; he so&nbsp; provided at&nbsp; cost&nbsp; to&nbsp; the employer until&nbsp; such&nbsp; time&nbsp; <b>he&nbsp; is declared&nbsp; fit or the degree&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; disability&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp; been established by the company-designated physician.</b><br><br>3.&nbsp; In addition to the above obligation of the employer to provide medical&nbsp;&nbsp; attention,&nbsp; the seafarer&nbsp;&nbsp; shall&nbsp;&nbsp; also&nbsp;&nbsp; receive&nbsp;&nbsp; sickness allowance from his employer in an amount equivalent to his basic wage computed <b>from&nbsp; the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the degree of disability&nbsp; has been assessed by the company-designated physician.

The&nbsp; company-designated physician&nbsp; must&nbsp; issue&nbsp; a final medical assessment&nbsp; on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; the&nbsp; company-designated&nbsp; physician&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to&nbsp; give&nbsp; his&nbsp; assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent&nbsp; and total;<br><br>3.<b>&nbsp; If the company-designated physician&nbsp; fails to give his assessment within&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; period&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; 120&nbsp; days&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp;&nbsp; justification (e.g. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended&nbsp; to 240 days. </b>The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and total;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp;&nbsp; justification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>In the case at bar, while the company-designated&nbsp; physician had issued both the Final Medical Report and Disability Grading on December 1, 2014 - beyond&nbsp; the&nbsp; initial&nbsp; 120-day&nbsp; period&nbsp; from&nbsp; repatriation&nbsp; which&nbsp; ended&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 6, 2014 - there was sufficient&nbsp; justification&nbsp; for such failure to give a timely medical assessment and to extend the period of diagnosis and treatment&nbsp; because&nbsp; Buico had required further medical treatment. As found by the CA, Buico had religiously undergone therapy from August 19, 2014 until&nbsp; November&nbsp;&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Final&nbsp; Medical&nbsp;&nbsp; Report&nbsp; and&nbsp; Disability Grading was thus timely issued by the company-designated&nbsp; physician within the extended 240-day period which ended on March 6, 2015.<br><br>Despite&nbsp; this,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; both&nbsp; the&nbsp; NLRC&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; CA&nbsp; ruled&nbsp; that&nbsp; the disability assessment and medical report made by the company-designated physician&nbsp; were&nbsp; not&nbsp; accurate&nbsp; and&nbsp; precise&nbsp; as to Buico's&nbsp; medical&nbsp; condition based on their&nbsp; wording. A closer look at these documents, however, gives a contrary conclusion.<br><br>The&nbsp;&nbsp; Final&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical&nbsp;&nbsp; Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> issued&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; company-designated physician contained the following discussion as to Buico's&nbsp; condition:<br><blockquote>On&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 2014,&nbsp; [Buico]&nbsp; was&nbsp; reevaluated&nbsp; by&nbsp; Orthopedic Surgery service.&nbsp; At this time, he has completed&nbsp; a total&nbsp; of 36 sessions of physical therapy. Subjectively,&nbsp; the patent reported intermittent&nbsp; right foot pain&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; VAS&nbsp;&nbsp; 4/10&nbsp; felt&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; prolonged&nbsp; walking&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; stair&nbsp;&nbsp; climbing.

Residual&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; in range&nbsp; of&nbsp; motion&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; right&nbsp; ankle&nbsp; was&nbsp; noted.&nbsp;<b> No&nbsp; other&nbsp; treatment intervention was indicated for&nbsp; the patient&nbsp; aside&nbsp; [from]&nbsp; continued self­ guided&nbsp; home&nbsp; exercises&nbsp; and&nbsp; as needed intake of pain&nbsp; medication.

The above documents show that the findings of the company-designated physician as to Buico's&nbsp; disability were final, accurate, and precise, especially since there was a specific disability grading and since it stated that there was no other treatment&nbsp; intervention&nbsp; indicated for Buico. It is likewise noteworthy that the disability grading given by the company-designated&nbsp; physician&nbsp; was a result of several months of diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp; In fact, this Grade 10 disability&nbsp; rating&nbsp; was already given to Buico at least twice as an interim disability grading, thereby further lending credence to the assessment given by the company-designated physician.<br><br>In the&nbsp; face&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; final&nbsp; disability grading&nbsp; given&nbsp; by the company­ designated physician&nbsp; within the prescribed period, the seafarer who intends to contest such assessment has the duty to observe the third doctor provision under the 2010 POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; jurisprudence,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-observance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the seafarer of the third&nbsp;&nbsp; doctor&nbsp;&nbsp; referral&nbsp;&nbsp; provision&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract,&nbsp;&nbsp; the employer can insist on the company-designated&nbsp; physician's assessment even against the contrary opinion by another doctor, unless the seafarer expresses his disagree1nent by asking for a referral to a third doctor who shall make a determination&nbsp; and whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Securing&nbsp; a&nbsp; third&nbsp; doctor's&nbsp;&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; seafarer,&nbsp; who&nbsp; must actively or expressly request for it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the pronouncement&nbsp; made by the NLRC, the referral to a third doctor&nbsp; is mandatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Without&nbsp; referral to a third doctor, there is no valid challenge to the company-designated&nbsp; physician's findings. Ultimately, therefore,&nbsp; the company-designated&nbsp; physician's&nbsp; findings in such a situation must be upheld over the findings of the personal doctor of the seafarer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; instant&nbsp; case,&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; company-designated&nbsp; physician&nbsp; gave&nbsp; a final Grade 10 disability assessment, Buico consulted his own physician who opined that he was unfit to perform sea duty in whatever capacity with a permanent disability status. Thereafter, Buico filed a complaint against his employers without first expressly requesting the company for the referral of the matter to a third doctor.<br><br>This failure by Buico to comply with the requirement of referral to a third doctor is tantamount to a violation of terms under the POEA-SEC. Consequently, without a binding third-party opinion, the final, accurate and precise findings of the company-designated physician prevail over the conclusion of the seafarer's personal doctor.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the LA had correctly awarded&nbsp; Grade&nbsp; 10&nbsp; disability&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; to&nbsp; Buico&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; disability grading given by the company-designated&nbsp; physician. Further, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, the total monetary award in his favor shall be subject to an interest&nbsp; of 6% per annum from the finality&nbsp; of this Decision until full payment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises&nbsp; considered,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated October 13, 2016 and Resolution dated March 31, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
