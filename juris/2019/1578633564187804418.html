Here, it was amply established that Pagkatipunan just barged into the dwelling of AAA and her family, took advantage of the moment while his neighbors' minor daughter was sleeping alone in the <i>sala</i>, and sexually ravaged her right there and then. His blatant violation of the sanctity of AAA and her family's dwelling aggravated the crime of rape.

Records bear AAA's detailed narration of the incident when their neighbor Pagkatipunan entered the house of AAA and her family and ordered her to sit in the <i>sala</i>. There, he further ordered her to undress, and as soon as she did, he licked her vagina. According to AAA, she could not do anything because she was afraid of him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> She recounted what he did to her just two (2) days after he inserted his penis in her vagina, thus: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="97%"> <div align="justify">And when Joseph Pagkatipunan spread your legs, what did he do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That was the moment he licked my vagina, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was your reaction then? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I was afraid, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did he say anything to you? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">None, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">While he was doing that, what happened? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">My father saw it, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">By the way, other than you said licking your private part, did he do anything else?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What is that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">He inserted his penis in my vagina, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When was that? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That was October 16, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">You said [awhile ago] that while Joseph was licking your private part your father arrived, what happened when your father arrived? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">My father punched him, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>AAA's testimony was positive, straightforward and categorical. Her father BBB corroborated her testimony. BBB testified that on October 18, 2006, around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, he got home from work and saw with his own eyes Pagkatipunan down on his knees licking AAA's vagina. He rushed straight and punched Pagkatipunan who managed to run out and escape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p> <p> As in the first case, the trial court gave credence to AAA's testimony for being positive, straightforward and categorical. Indeed, the trial court's factual findings on the credibility of witnesses are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect. This is because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor, and is in the best position to discern whether they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This rule becomes more compelling when such factual findings carry the full concurrence of the Court of Appeals, as in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Against AAA's positive testimony, Pagkatipunan only offered denial and alibi. We have pronounced time and again that both denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witness that the accused committed the crime. Thus, as between a categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a mere denial on the other, the former is generally held to prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>Penalty in Crim.
