After assessing the information, a buy-bust operation was planned with PO2 Joel Diomampo (PO2 Diomampo) designated as poseur-buyer and given a PhP 500.00 bill marked with his initials "JD." PO2 Jorge Santiago (PO2 Santiago) together with other police officers acted as back-ups.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Before the team was dispatched, SPO1 Jeffrey Flores (SPO1 Flores) prepared a Pre-Operation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and sent a Coordination Form<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). Afterwards, the team, along with the informant, proceeded to <em>Barangay</em> Culiat. Upon arrival thereat at around 8 o'clock in the evening, they parked their car along Mujahedin Street inside Shalaam Compound. PO2 Diomampo and the informant alighted first from the vehicle and walked towards the target area while the other members of the team also walked on foot and discreetly positioned themselves about 15 to 20 meters away from PO2 Diomampo.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Upon seeing Addin standing in front of a house along Mujahedin Street, the informant approached the former and introduced him to PO2 Diomampo. The informant told Addin that PO2 Diomampo wanted to buy <i>shabu</i>. In response, Addin asked how much <em>shabu</em> PO2 Diomampo will buy, to which PO2 Diomampo replied PhP 500.00 worth. Addin then handed over the <em>shabu</em> after receipt of payment thereof. Thereafter, PO2 Diomampo lighted a cigarette, which was the pre-arranged signal that the sale was consummated. Immediately after, the other police operatives rushed to the target area while Addin tried to escape. He was, however, apprehended by PO2 Santiago who was coming from the opposite direction.</div><div align="justify"><br> </div><div align="justify">PO2 Santiago handcuffed Addin and informed him of his offense and his constitutional rights. He also recovered from Addin the buy-bust money. Shortly thereafter, the team vacated the area since they were aware that a number of police officers have already perished in the area due to previous shoot-outs. PO2 Diomampo held on to the seized sachet of <em>shabu</em> while PO2 Santiago kept the marked money.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">The team arrived at the police station at around 10 o'clock in the evening. PO2 Diomampo then turned over the seized item to the police investigator, SPO1 Flores, who prepared a Request for Laboratory Examination<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to the PNP Crime Laboratory that same night. Likewise, SPO1 Flores prepared a Joint Affidavit of Arrest,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> an Affidavit of Attestation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and the Inventory of Property Seized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The latter was witnessed by Addin's relatives and a member of the media, Vener Santos.

Relevantly, it noted that although the inventory of the seized items was not done in the crime scene, the same was justifiable since the police officers found the area dangerous. The RTC took judicial notice of the fact that Shalaam Muslim Compound was known to be a dangerous place for police officers due to prior shoot-out incidents. The trial court further pointed out that unlike the marking of the seized items, the inventory need not be performed at the crime scene since no search warrant was involved.

Additionally, it failed to overcome the presumption of regularity with regard to the police officers' discharge of their duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Lastly, it asserts that Addin's defense of denial was not corroborated with sufficient proof and therefore cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></div><p align="center"><strong><u>The Court's Ruling</u></strong></p><div align="justify">There is merit in the appeal.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 provides that to successfully prosecute the offense of sale of illegal drugs, the following elements must be satisfied: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In a buy-bust operation, the receipt by the poseur-buyer of the dangerous drug and the corresponding receipt by the seller of the marked money consummate the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In the instant case, the elements for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs are present. The testimonies of the police officers, coupled with the documentary and object evidence, demonstrated that Addin was caught selling <em>shabu</em> to PO2 Diomampo who acted as the poseur-buyer. Addin's receipt of the marked PhP 500.00 bill consummated the sale of the illegal drug. Hence, based on the evidence, the sale was consummated and the confiscated item, the <em>corpus delicti</em>, was presented in court to prove the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></div><div align="justify"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><br></sup></div><div align="justify">Moreover, this Court finds that Addin failed show proof that the police officers who composed the buy-bust team were impelled by ill motives to implicate Addin or were performing their official duties.

(Emphasis supplied)</div></blockquote><div align="justify">In relation to this, Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 provides:&nbsp; </div><blockquote><div align="justify">(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, <u>a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</u> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis Ours).</div></blockquote><div align="justify">Section 21 of RA 9165, prior to its amendment by RA 10640 on July 15, 2014, mandates that the marking, photographing and inventory of the seized items be done in the presence of representatives from the media and the DOJ, and any elected public official. Notably, in this case, the police only managed to secure the presence and signature of a representative from the media to serve as additional witness. No explanation was provided why the presence of a representative from the DOJ and any elected public official was not secured. <br></div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">To stress, the prosecution bears the burden to justify the police officers' non-compliance based on meritorious grounds, provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been properly preserved. Simply put, the chain of custody in handling the seized item should not have been broken.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">It is important to note that this Court, in the recent case of <em>People v. Lim</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> underscored the significance of the presence of the three key witnesses, specifically a representative from the DOJ, the media, and any elected public official, at the time of the physical inventory and the taking of photographs of the confiscated items. In case the said representatives are absent, this Court held that:&nbsp; </div><blockquote><div align="justify">[I]t must be <strong>alleged and proved</strong> that the presence of the three witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seized was not obtained due to reason/s such as: </div><blockquote><div align="justify"><strong>(1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action [from] the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official[s] themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove[d] futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face[d] the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div></blockquote></blockquote><div align="justify">Aside from this, jurisprudence states that there should be evidence to show that earnest efforts were employed by the prosecution in order to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses in accordance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165. Thus, the case of <em>Ramos v. People</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> is instructive:</div><blockquote><div align="justify"> [I]t is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not <em>per se</em> render the confiscated items inadmissible. However, a justifiable reason for such failure or <strong>a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses</strong> under Section 21 of RA [No.] 9165 must be adduced. In <em>People v. Umipang</em>, the Court held that the prosecution must show that <strong>earnest efforts</strong> were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the law for a 'sheer statement that representatives were unavailable without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse.' Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance. These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time­ beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest-to prepare for a buy­-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand knowing full well that they would have to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21 of RA 9165. <strong>As such, police officers are compelled not only to state reasons for their non­ compliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstances, their actions were reasonable.</strong></div></blockquote><div align="justify">In view of these, it should be reiterated that "in the event that the presence of the essential witnesses was not obtained, the prosecution must establish not only the reasons for their absence, but also the fact that serious and sincere efforts were exerted in securing their presence. Failure to disclose the justification for non-compliance with the requirements and the lack of evidence of serious attempts to secure the presence of the necessary witnesses result in a substantial gap in the chain of custody of evidence that shall adversely affect the authenticity of the prohibited substance presented in court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></div><div align="justify"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><br></sup></div><div align="justify">In the case at bench, the prosecution failed to at least allege and then prove any specific reason to explain the absence of the representative from the DOJ and any elected public official present during the taking of inventory and photographs. There was no attempt at all to justify the absence of these witnesses, especially given that they had sufficient time to plan the buy-bust operation even if it was conducted at nighttime. Surely, while planning, they could have exerted efforts to request for the attendance of the required witnesses during the inventory. If nobody was available, the police officers could have adequately explained it on paper or even during the trial of the case.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Withal, at most, the explanation given by the police officers pertained only to why they conducted the inventory and took the photographs at the police station instead of at the place of operation or arrest, and did not touch on the reason for the absence of the required witnesses. Additionally, the police officers did not show that they exerted earnest efforts to secure the presence of the other required representatives.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Indeed, there was no justifiable ground advanced by the prosecution to excuse the absence of the said representatives. Relevantly, this lapse casts doubt upon the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item. Alternatively, this gives rise to the probability that the integrity of the seized item might have been compromised while under police custody.</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Moreover, this Court finds the efforts to coordinate with PDEA lacking, as the police officers merely faxed the coordination form and supposedly made a mere phone call. There was no convincing proof to show that PDEA as an agency confirmed the supposed coordination with the police officers tasked to conduct the buy-bust operation or that any representative from PDEA would join the operation. <br></div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">Finally, it has not escaped Our notice that here was already a mention in the Affidavit of Arrest that the illegal drug seized from Addin tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride when in fact, the initial and confirmatory results have yet to be released. This only shows the haphazard handling by the police of the seized sachet which further erodes its integrity.
