				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The clause "or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less" as reinstated in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10022 is unconstitutional, and has no force and effect of law. It violates due process as it deprives overseas workers of their monetary claims without any discernable valid purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> assailing the September 29, 2011 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and January 26, 2012 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals ruled that Julita M. Aldovino (Aldovino), Joan B. Lagrimas, Winnie B. Lingat, Chita A. Sales, Sherly L. Guinto, Revilla S. De Jesus (De Jesus), and Laila V. Orpilla were all illegally dismissed from service.<br><br>Aldovino and her co-applicants applied for work at Gold and Green Manpower Management and Development Services, Inc. (Gold and Green Manpower), a local manning agency whose foreign principal is Sage International Development Company, Ltd. (Sage International).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Eventually, they were hired as sewers for Dipper Semi-Conductor Company, Ltd. (Dipper Semi-Conductor), a Taiwan-based company. Their respective employment contracts provided an eight (8)-hour working day, a fixed monthly salary, and entitlement to overtime pay, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Before they could be deployed for work, Gold and Green Manpower required each applicant to pay a P72,000.00 placement fee. But since the applicants were unable to produce the amount on their own, Gold and Green Manpower referred them to E-Cash Paylite and Financing, Inc. (E-Cash Paylite), where they loaned their placement fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Once Aldovino and her co-workers arrived in Taiwan, Gold and Green Manpower took all their travel documents, including their passports. They were then made to sign another contract that provides that they would be paid on a piece-rate basis instead of a fixed monthly salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>During their employment, Aldovino and her co-workers toiled from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. for six (6) days a week. At times, they were forced to work on Sundays without any overtime premium.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Because they were paid on a piece-rate basis, they received less than the fixed monthly salary stipulated in their original contract. When Aldovino and her co-workers inquired, Dipper Semi-Conductor refused to disclose the schedule of payment on a piece-rate basis. Eventually, they defaulted on their loan obligations with E-Cash Paylite.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On January 19, 2009, Aldovino and her co-workers, except De Jesus, filed before a local court in Taiwan a Complaint against their employers, Dipper Semi-Conductor and Sage International.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On March 26, 2009, the parties met before the Bureau of Labor Affairs for a dialogue. There, Dipper Semi-Conductor ordered Aldovino and her co-workers to return to the Philippines as it was no longer interested in their services. They were then made to immediately pack their belongings, after which they were dropped off at a train station in Taipei. After a few hours, a friend brought them to the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, where they stayed for a week. They were then transferred to Hope Shelter, where they remained for four (4) months while the case was pending.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"></sup><br>Eventually, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which read:<br><blockquote>1.

It found that Aldovino and her co-workers were not illegally dismissed and that they voluntarily returned to the Philippines. Moreover, the Compromise Agreement barred any further claims arising from their employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the National Labor Relations Commission deleted the award of financial assistance for lack of factual and legal bases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Aldovino and her co-workers moved for reconsideration, but their Motion was denied for lack of merit in the National Labor Relations Commission August 31, 2010 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Hence, they filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In its September 29,2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court of Appeals reversed the labor tribunals' rulings. It not only ruled that Aldovino and her co-workers had been illegally dismissed from service, but also declared that the Compromise Agreement did not bar them from filing an illegal dismissal case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Court of Appeals ordered Gold and Green Manpower and Sage International to pay the workers their salaries "for the unexpired portion of their contract in accordance with Section 7 of [Republic Act No.] 10022<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and pursuant to <i>Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services, Inc.</i>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> among others. The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED. The Decision dated July 29,2010 and Order dated August 31, 2010 of the NLRC in NLRC LAC (OFW-L) 05-000409-10, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondents Gold and Green Manpower Management and Development Services, Inc. and Sage International Development Co., Ltd. are hereby ordered to reimburse petitioners their placement fee with interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum, and to pay the salaries of petitioners for the unexpired portion of their respective employment contracts or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>Aldovino and her co-workers moved for partial reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> praying that the three (3)-month cap stated in the Decision's dispositive portion be annulled, pursuant to <i>Serrano</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, their Motion was denied in the Court of Appeals' January 26, 2012 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Thus, Aldovino and her co-workers filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On June 15, 2012, respondents filed their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to which petitioners filed a Reply on September 5, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioners again question the three (3)-month salary cap stated in the dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision. Citing <i>Serrano</i>, they assert that the three (3)-month cap in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042, or the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, as reenacted in Republic Act No. 10022, has already been declared unconstitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Petitioners thus assert that they are entitled to the payment of their salaries for the unexpired portion of their employment contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondents question the legality of the monetary damages awarded to petitioners. They assert that the Court of Appeals erred in nullifying the parities' Compromise Agreement, pointing out that the labor tribunals had already rendered it valid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The agreement, they further argue, released them from liability on petitioners' other claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The chief issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not petitioners Julita M. Aldovino, Joan B. Lagrimas, Winnie B. Lingat, Chita A. Sales, Sherly L. Guinto, Revilla S. De Jesus, and Laila V. Orpilla are entitled to the payment of their salaries for the unexpired portion of their employment contract. Subsumed under this is the issue of whether or not Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10022, which reinstated the three (3)-month cap, has the force and effect of law.<br><br>To pass upon this issue, this Court must resolve the following:<br><br>First, whether or not the Compromise Agreement barred all other claims against respondents Gold and Green Manpower Management and Development Services, Inc. and Sage International Development Company, Ltd., and Alberto C. Alvina; and<br><br>Second, whether or not petitioners were illegally dismissed and, consequently, entitled to the reimbursement of their placement fees and payment of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>The Petition is meritorious.<br><br>It must be noted that this case is governed by Philippine laws. Both the Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and the Labor Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> guarantee the security of tenure. It is not stripped off when Filipinos work in a different jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We follow the <i>lex loci contractus</i> principle, which means that the law of the place where the contract is executed governs the contract.<br><br>In <i>Triple Eight Integrated Services, Inc. v National Labor Relations Commission</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><blockquote>First, established is the rule that <i>lex loci contractus</i> (the law of the place where the contract is made) governs in this jurisdiction. There is no question that the contract of employment in this case was perfected here in the Philippines. Therefore, the Labor Code, its implementing rules and regulations, and other laws affecting labor apply in this case. Furthermore, settled is the rule that the courts of the forum will not enforce any foreign claim obnoxious to the forum's public policy. Here in the Philippines, employment agreements are more than contractual in nature. The Constitution itself, in Article XIII, Section 3, guarantees the special protection of workers. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br>This public policy should be borne in mind in this case because to allow foreign employers to determine for and by themselves whether an overseas contract worker may be dismissed on the ground of illness would encourage illegal or arbitrary pre-termination of employment contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Indeed, because petitioners' employment contracts were executed in the Philippines, Philippine laws govern them. Respondents, then, must answer and be held liable under our laws.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Respondents claim that the Compromise Agreement barred petitioners from holding them liable for claims. This is outright erroneous.<br><br>Waivers and quitclaims executed by employees are generally frowned upon for being contrary to public policy. This is based on the recognition that employers and employees do not stand on equal footing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In <i>Land and Housing Development Corporation v. Esquillo</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote>We have heretofore explained that the reason why quitclaims are commonly frowned upon as contrary to public policy, and why they are held to be ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of the workers' legal rights, is the fact that the employer and the employee obviously do not stand on the same footing. The employer drove the employee to the wall. The latter must have to get hold of money. Because, out of a job, he had to face the harsh necessities of life. He thus found himself in no position to resist money proffered. His, then, is a case of adherence, not of choice. One thing sure, however, is that petitioners did not relent on their claim. They pressed it. They are deemed not [to] have waived any of their rights. <i>Renuntiatio non praesumitur.</i><br><br>Along this line, we have more trenchantly declared that quitclaims and/or complete releases executed by the employees do not estop them from pursuing their claims arising from unfair labor practices of the employer. The basic reason for this is that such quitclaims and/or complete releases are against public policy and, therefore, null and void. The acceptance of termination does not divest a laborer of the right to prosecute his employer for unfair labor practice acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Quitclaims do not bar employees from filing labor complaints and demanding benefits to which they are legally entitled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> They are "ineffective in barring recovery of the full measure of a worker's rights, and the acceptance of benefits therefrom does not amount to estoppel."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The law does not recognize agreements that result in compensation less than what is mandated by law. These quitclaims do not prevent employees from subsequently claiming benefits to which they are legally entitled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In <i>Am-Phil Food Concepts, Inc. v. Padilla</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> this Court held that quitclaims do not negate charges for illegal dismissal:<br><blockquote>The law looks with disfavor upon quitclaims and releases by employees pressured into signing by unscrupulous employers minded to evade legal responsibilities. As a rule, deeds of release or quitclaim cannot bar employees from demanding benefits to which they are legally entitled or from contesting the legality of their dismissal. The acceptance of those benefits would not amount to estoppel. The amounts already received by the retrenched employees as consideration for signing the quitclaims should, however, be deducted from their respective monetary awards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Here, the parties entered into the Compromise Agreement to terminate the case for underpayment of wages, which petitioners had previously filed against respondents in Taiwan. The object and foundation of the Compromise Agreement was to settle the payment of salaries and overtime premiums to which petitioners were legally entitled. Hence, it should not be construed as a restriction on petitioners' right to prosecute other legitimate claims they may have against respondents.<br><br>Paragraph 7 of the Compromise Agreement, which stipulates that petitioners "shall give up other rights of compensation . . . [and] shall not ask for any compensation based on any other causes[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> cannot bar petitioners from filing this case and from being indemnified should respondents be adjudged liable. Blanket waivers exonerating employers from liability on the claims of their employees are ineffective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Besides, at the time the parties' Compromise Agreement was executed, respondents had just terminated petitioners from employment. Petitioners, therefore, had no other choice but to accede to the terms and conditions of the agreement to recover the difference in their salaries and overtime pay. With no means of livelihood, they signed the Compromise Agreement out of dire necessity.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Respondents further justify the dismissal by arguing that petitioners voluntarily severed their employment when they signed the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>This argument is also untenable.<br><br>Under the Labor Code, employers may only terminate employment for a just or authorized cause and after complying with procedural due process requirements. Articles 297 and 300 of the Labor Code enumerate the causes of employment termination either by employers or employees:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 297. [282] <i>Termination by employer</i>. — An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representatives; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(e) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Other causes analogous to the foregoing.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>. . . .<br><br>ARTICLE 300. [285] <i>Termination by employee</i>. — (a) An employee may terminate without just cause the employee-employer relationship by serving a written notice on the employer at least one (1) month in advance. The employer upon whom no such notice was served may hold the employee liable for damages. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> An employee may put an end to the relationship without serving any notice on the employer for any of the following just causes:</div></td></tr></tbody></table><ol><li>Serious insult by the employer or his representative on the honor and person of the employee;<br><br></li><li>Inhuman and unbearable treatment accorded the employee by the employer or his representative;<br><br></li><li>Commission of a crime or offense by the employer or his representative against the person of the employee or any of the immediate members of his family; and<br><br></li><li>Other causes analogous to any of the foregoing.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In illegal dismissal cases, the burden of proof that employees were validly dismissed rests on the employers. Failure to discharge this burden means that the dismissal is illegal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>A review of the records here shows that the termination of petitioners' employment was effected merely because respondents no longer wanted their services. This is not an authorized or just cause for dismissal under the Labor Code. Employment contracts cannot be terminated on a whim.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners did not voluntarily sever their employment when they signed the Compromise Agreement, which, again, cannot be used to justify a dismissal.<br><br>Furthermore, petitioners were not accorded due process. A valid dismissal must comply with substantive and procedural due process: there must be a valid cause and a valid procedure. The employer must comply with the two (2)-notice requirement, while the employee must be given an opportunity to be heard.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Here, petitioners were only verbally dismissed, without any notice given or having been informed of any just cause for their dismissal.<br><br>This Court cannot rest easy on respondents' insistence that petitioners voluntarily terminated their employment. Contrary to their assertion, petitioners were left with no choice but to accept the Compromise Agreement and to go back to the Philippines.<br><br>After accumulating a huge amount of debt to work abroad, petitioners were burdened to continue working for respondents that they were constrained to sign the piece-rate-based contract upon arriving in Taiwan. As a result, they were paid less than if they were paid on a monthly basis and, worse, they were deprived of their overtime premium. Petitioners inevitably defaulted on their loan obligations. To make matters worse, they were terminated from employment on a whim and were left homeless.<br><br>One can only imagine how all these compounded a heavy burden upon petitioners. Overseas Filipino workers venture out into unfamiliar lands in the hope of providing a better future for their families. They endure years of being away from their loved ones while bearing a life of toil abroad. Our laws afford protection to our workers, whether employed locally or abroad. It is this Court's bounden duty to uphold these laws and dispense justice for petitioners. With their right to substantive and procedural due process denied, it is clear that petitioners were illegally dismissed from service.<br><br>As a consequence of the illegal dismissal, petitioners are also entitled to moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. In <i>Torreda v. Investment and Capital Corporation of the Philippines</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><blockquote>Moral damages are recoverable when the dismissal of an employee is attended by bad faith or fraud or constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy. Exemplary damages, on the other hand, are recoverable when the dismissal was done in a wanton, oppressive, or malevolent manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners have sufficiently shown how bad faith attended respondents' actions. They were made to sign a new employment contract on a piece-rate basis, which violates the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act. Under that contract, petitioners were underpaid and deprived of their overtime premium.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners' employment contracts were unilaterally terminated. After their meeting before the Bureau of Labor, respondents told petitioners that they were no longer employed. As the Court of Appeals noted, respondents did not refute petitioners' narration that they were immediately escorted back to the factory, ordered to pack their possessions, and were left at a train station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Petitioners were forced to stay in shelters for months without any means of livelihood. Worse, they were deprived of due process when they were terminated without any notice or opportunity to be heard.<br><br>Being deprived of their hard-earned salaries and, eventually, of their employment, caused petitioners mental anguish, wounded feelings, and serious anxiety. The award of moral damages is but appropriate.<br><br>Consequently, the award of exemplary damages is necessary to deter future employers from committing the same acts.<br><br>Additionally, petitioners are also entitled to the award of attorney's fees under Article 2208 of the Civil Code:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:<br><br>(1) When exemplary damages are awarded;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiffs plainly valid, just and demandable claim;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(7) In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers[.]<br></blockquote>The award of attorney's fees is proper because: (1) exemplary damages is also awarded; (2) respondents acted in gross bad faith in refusing to pay petitioners their hard-earned salaries in form of overtime premiums; and (3) this case is also a complaint for recovery of wages.<br><br>In addition, we further sustain the Court of Appeals' ruling in having ordered the reimbursement of petitioners' placement fees. As they were terminated without just, valid, or authorized cause, petitioners are entitled to the full reimbursement of their placement fees with interest at 12% per annum in accordance with Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10022.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>In <i>Serrano</i>, this Court ruled that the clause "or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less" under Section 10<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act is unconstitutional for violating the equal protection and substantive due process clauses.<br><br>Later, however, this clause was kept when the law was amended by Republic Act No. 10022 in 2010. Section 7 of the new law mirrors the same clause:<br><blockquote>SECTION 7. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042, as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br>"SEC. 10. <i>Money Claims</i>. — Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the Labor Arbiters of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide, within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing of the complaint, the claims arising out of an employer-employee relationship or by virtue of any law or contract involving Filipino workers for overseas deployment including claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages. Consistent with this mandate, the NLRC shall endeavor to update and keep abreast with the developments in the global services industry.<br><br>The liability of the principal/employer and the recruitment/placement agency for any and all claims under this section shall be joint and several.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Sameer Overseas Placement Agency, Inc. v. Cabiles</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> this Court was confronted with the question of the constitutionality of the reinstated clause in Republic Act No. 10022. Reiterating our finding in <i>Serrano</i>, we ruled that "limiting wages that should be recovered by an illegally dismissed overseas worker to three months is both a violation of due process and the equal protection clauses of the Constitution."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In striking down the clause, we ruled:<br><blockquote>Putting a cap on the money claims of certain overseas workers does not increase the standard of protection afforded to them. On the other hand, foreign employers are more incentivized by the reinstated clause to enter into contracts of at least a year because it gives them more flexibility to violate our overseas workers' rights. Their liability for arbitrarily terminating overseas workers is decreased at the expense of the workers whose rights they violated. Meanwhile, these overseas workers who are impressed with an expectation of a stable job overseas for the longer contract period disregard other opportunities only to be terminated earlier. They are left with claims that are less than what others in the same situation would receive. The reinstated clause, therefore, creates a situation where the law meant to protect them makes violation of rights easier and simply benign to the violator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>This case should be no different from <i>Serrano</i> and <i>Sameer</i>.<br><br>A statute declared unconstitutional "confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is inoperative as if it has not been passed at all."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Incorporating a similarly worded provision in a subsequent legislation does not cure its unconstitutionality. Without any discemable change in the circumstances warranting a reversal, this Court will not hesitate to strike down the same provision.<br><br>As such, we reiterate our ruling in <i>Sameer</i> that the reinstated clause in Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10022 has no force and effect of law. It is unconstitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Hence, petitioners are entitled to the award of salaries based on the actual unexpired portion of their employment contracts.
