				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Office of the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause is accorded great respect in the absence of any grave abuse of discretion. <p> This Court resolves a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> seeking to reverse and set aside the Office of the Ombudsman's June 28, 2006 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and January 28, 2009 Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dismissing the Presidential Commission on Good Government's Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for lack of probable cause. The Office of the Ombudsman ruled that the various loans and guaranty accommodations granted by the Development Bank of the Philippines (Development Bank) to Continental Manufacturing Corporation (Continental Manufacturing) were not behest loans. It found no probable cause to charge respondents for violating Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p> Development Bank had initially granted Continental Manufacturing a loan amounting to P43,586,693.93, with a collateral worth P43,063,077.08.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> On March 10, 1981, Development Bank granted Continental Manufacturing another credit facility amounting to P28 million. The credit facility was approved under Development Bank Resolution No. 864. Later, the credit facility was increased to P30 million.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> Allegedly, when this credit facility was granted, Continental Manufacturing had been undergoing financial problems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> Later, Development Bank issued Board Resolution No. 1278, granting Continental Manufacturing an interim currency loan worth US$2 million to pay its overdue obligations to its suppliers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> In 1982, under Board Resolution No. 3144, Development Bank also guaranteed Continental Manufacturing's P25 million obligation to Citibank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> When the loans matured, Continental Manufacturing was unable to pay its obligations. Though Development Bank foreclosed the mortgages, the proceeds were still insufficient. As of the sheriff's sale on May 31, 1984, the collateral for Continental Manufacturing was appraised at P71,123,700.00, while its obligations with Development Bank totaled P260,722,218.00. As of September 30, 1985, Continental Manufacturing's obligations ballooned to P309,726,928.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> On December 8, 1986, Proclamation No. 50 was issued to facilitate the rehabilitation of certain financial institutions. Following this, Development Bank transferred its rights, interests, and assets in Continental Manufacturing to the government through a Deed of Transfer dated February 27, 1987.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On March 14, 1989, Development Bank bought back the Continental Manufacturing account from the government through a Deed of Reconveyance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The offer to retrieve was approved by the Asset Privatization Trust on March 25, 1988 and by the Committee on Privatization on June 23, 1988. Development Bank later remitted the total retrieval price of P198,399,177.00 to the Asset Privatization Trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> On October 8, 1992, Administrative Order No. 13 was issued, creating the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans (Committee on Behest Loans).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It was tasked with making an inventory of behest loans, determining parties involved, and recommending the appropriate action that the government should take to recover the loans:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> 1) the loan was undercollateralized; 2) the borrower corporation was undercapitalized; 3) a direct or indirect endorsement by a high government official, like the presence of marginal notes; 4) the stockholders, officers or agents of the borrower corporation were identified to be cronies; 5) a deviation of the loan from the purpose intended; 6) the use of corporate layering; 7) the non-feasibility of the project; and 8) an unusual speed in releasing the loan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> After its investigation, the Committee on Behest Loans finished its 17<sup>th</sup> Fortnightly Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated November 29, 1993, where it determined that the accommodations granted to Continental Manufacturing were behest loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> The 17<sup>th</sup> Fortnightly Report read: </p><blockquote> <p> A. Based on the criteria set by the Ad Hoc Committee, the following corporations were found to possess positive characteristics of behest loans:</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> 5. CONTINENTAL MANUFACTURING CORPORATION </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> A preliminary investigation should be conducted to determine the existence of a probable cause to prosecute administratively and criminally the government officials and private individuals who participated in the grant of the irregular loans. . . .</p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> An Executive Summary on each of the above accounts is hereto attached for immediate reference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The Executive Summary of the 17<sup>th</sup> Fortnightly Report read:</p> <blockquote> <p> A. CORPORATIONS WITH POSITIVE FINDINGS: </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> 5. CONTINENTAL MANUFACTURING CORPORATION</p> <p> The loan account was undercapitalized on the 12th loan in 1981 and undercollateralized on the 13th loan in 1985. Mr. Dewee (sic) Dee, President and General Manager of the company is a known crony of the Marcos administration. The account was retrieved by DBP in March 14, 1989 being a performing asset.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On November 28, 2003, the Presidential Commission on Good Government filed before the Office of the Ombudsman an Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for violation of Section 3(e)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and (g)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended.</p> <p> The Affidavit-Complaint was filed against Development Bank's high­ ranking officials, including: (1) Acting Chairman Rafael E. Sison (Sison); (2) Executive Officer Rodolfo D. Manalo (Manalo); and (3) Governor Jose R. Tengco (Tengco), as well as John/Jane Does. Also included as respondents were Continental Manufacturing's officers and directors, namely: (1) Rufino E. Deeunhong (Deeunhong); (2) Dewey Dee (Dewey); (3) Donald Dee (Donald); (4) Pedro Aguirre (Aguirre); (5) Inocencio Ferrer (Ferrer); (6) Yoshihino Nakamura (Nakamura); (7) Sadao Nakano (Nakano); (8) Ken Kikutani (Kikutani); (9) Ichiro Utake (Utake); (10) Emigdio Tanjuatco (Tanjuatco); and (11) Cesar Recto (Recto).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p> <p> Citing the 17<sup>th</sup> Fortnightly Report, the Presidential Commission on Good Government alleged that when the initial loan of P43,586,696.93 was granted, Continental Manufacturing's total loan obligation from its creditors became P635.8 million, while its total assets only amounted to P314 million. It also claimed that the collateral for the loan with Development Bank was only P43,063,077.00. Despite Continental Manufacturing's poor financial standing and already undercollateralized existing loan, Development Bank again issued in its favor an additional P28 million worth of credit facility, and again an interim currency loan of US$ 2 million.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Of the respondents, only Manalo, Tanjuatco, Tengco, and Donald filed Counter-Affidavits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> In its June 28, 2006 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Office of the Ombudsman dismissed the Complaint for lack of probable cause. </p><p> Convinced that the credit facility and guaranty granted to Continental Manufacturing were not behest loans,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Office of the Ombudsman found that the 17th Fortnightly Report only made sweeping generalizations that the loans were undercollateralized and that the government was unduly injured when Development Bank failed to recover the entire obligation after foreclosure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman lent credence to Development Bank's explanation that the loan accommodations were granted to Continental Manufacturing to allow it to recover from a financial crisis after its then president, Dewey, left on January 9, 1981.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It found that Development Bank granted the credit facilities for Continental Manufacturing to be able to sustain its operations and prevent the dislocation of its employees. It noted that the capital requirements were to be endorsed under the Emergency Rehabilitation Fund of the Central Bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It also noted that Development Bank's guaranty of Continental Manufacturing's obligation to Citibank was conditioned on Citibank's mortgage of properties in favor of Development Bank. Thus, it found that the loans could not have been undercollateralized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the Office of the Ombudsman held that there was no proof to substantiate the allegation that respondents were granted accommodations because they had close ties with then President Ferdinand Marcos (Marcos).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman also held that Continental Manufacturing's request for loan accommodations had been subjected to intensive studies and evaluation. It noted that the securities were identified and the terms and conditions of the loan accommodations were clearly stated in the Development Bank's Office Correspondences. It concluded that respondents exercised sound business judgment and their acts were in accordance with acceptable banking practices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman further determined that there was no indication of any criminal design or collusion to cause undue injury to the government. It held that there was no evidence of any unwarranted benefit granted in favor of Continental Manufacturing or of any transaction that is illegal, irregular, or grossly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p> Finally, the Office of the Ombudsman noted that Development Bank's charter under Republic Act No. 85 mandates it to grant credit facilities for the rehabilitation of agriculture and industry. Thus, it is presumed to have performed its duties regularly. In any case, the Office of the Ombudsman held that Continental Manufacturing's account was fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> The Presidential Commission on Good Government moved for reconsideration, but its Motion was denied by the Office of the Ombudsman's January 28, 2009 Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Hence, it filed this Petition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> including the Office of the Ombudsman as a respondent.</p><p> After requiring the parties to file their respective Comments and Reply, this Court directed them to file their Memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner questions public respondent's dismissal of its Complaint, insisting that the accommodations granted to Continental Manufacturing are behest loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It reiterates that the evidence and reports showed that the loans were approved, facilitated, and released despite being undercollateralized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> Petitioner further claims that public respondent only considered the Executive Summary of the 17<sup>th</sup> Fortnightly Report but disregarded the other documents that it submitted, including the Committee on Behest Loans' Terminal Report and the Development Bank's Board Resolutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> Petitioner contends that public respondent gravely abused its discretion in ignoring the Committee on Behest Loans' recommendations. It argues that the Committee's findings deserve credence and respect, as it was formed precisely to determine the existence of behest loans. As such, public respondent should not have substituted its own judgment over matters that the law has entrusted to the Committee's technical training and knowledge. Petitioner argues that the Committee's findings should have been conclusive and not subjected to judicial review absent any showing of fraud, imposition or mistake, or error of judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, petitioner argues that it has established a well-founded belief that the transactions were grossly disadvantageous to the government. Despite this, public respondent allegedly required it to present proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is tantamount to grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> Public respondent, petitioner claims, acted as a judge and a trier of facts in evaluating the evidence and probative value of the reports before trial on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> Petitioner further notes that public respondent manifested bias in respondents' favor when it affirmed their defenses despite not having appended or presented documents to support their claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> Respondents, on the other hand, insist on the Complaint's dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> Public respondent argues that petitioner failed to show that it committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Resolution and Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Moreover, it claims that in insisting on the findings of the Committee on Behest Loans, petitioner raises questions of fact improper in a petition for certiorari, where a party can only raise errors of jurisdiction or allege grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> Public respondent further asserts that there was no sufficient basis to characterize the loans and accommodations granted to Continental Manufacturing as behest loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p> Public respondent reiterates that the only evidence presented by petitioner was the 17<sup>th</sup> Fortnightly Report, which only made sweeping generalizations that: (1) the loans were undercollateralized; (2) there was undue injury to the government when Development Bank failed to recover the entire obligation after foreclosure; and (3) Continental Manufacturing was given unwarranted benefits and accommodations disadvantageous to the government. Public respondent maintains that there is no evidence to prove these allegations, or that the transactions were irregular or illegal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p> Public respondent also claims that according to records, Continental Manufacturing requested loans for rehabilitation after having suffered a financial crisis in January 1981, around the time that its then President Dewey left the company.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p> Public respondent denies that it usurped the functions of the Sandiganbayan in dismissing the Complaint. It posits that it is constitutionally mandated to exercise its investigatory and prosecutorial powers, which can only be done by examining the parties' allegations and their supporting evidence. It claims that the correctness of its determination is not a matter that the trial court may pass upon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> Insisting on its broad discretion to determine the existence of probable cause, public respondent cites this Court's policy not to interfere with its finding of probable cause without good and compelling reasons for finding of grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It maintains that without grave abuse of discretion, its dismissal of the Complaint for lack of probable cause should be respected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> Respondents Donald and Tengco raise similar arguments. They stress that in the absence of grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> public respondent's exercise of its independent discretion in determining probable cause should be respected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Similarly, they argue that there is no good and compelling reason for this Court to interfere with public respondent's findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> Respondent Donald further insists that public respondent "fairly, equitably, correctly[,] and objectively evaluated the evidence[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He claims that weighing the evidence is necessary in preliminary investigations and is part of public respondent's functions to determine a <i>prima facie</i> case before filing a case in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> He further points out that petitioner contradicts itself in arguing that public respondent should not have evaluated the evidence, but at the same time asserting that it failed to consider the evidence it adduced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Private respondent Tengco adds that petitioner failed to substantiate its claim that public respondent ignored the supporting documents attached to its Affidavit-Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p> Citing public respondent's finding, respondent Tengco insists that the allegations for the crime charged are too general and sweeping,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> with no supporting evidence other than the 17<sup>th </sup>Fortnightly Report, which only stated that the loans were undercollateralized and that the government was unduly injured.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Respondents Donald and Tengco insist that "sufficient properties were required as collateral to guarantee the ... loans and guaranty[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, Respondents Donald and Tengco assert that petitioner failed to substantiate all the elements of Section 3(e) and (g) of the Anti­ Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p><p> For Section 3(e), they claim that petitioner did not show evidence that the loan grant unduly favored Continental Manufacturing or its stockholders or officials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Respondent Tengco points out that evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence was not specifically averred or proven.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> They further assert that no injury exists since Development Bank's account with Continental Manufacturing has been fully paid and settled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> Respondents Dee and Tengco further claim that petitioner allegedly failed to prove that Continental Manufacturing performed acts that unduly influenced Development Bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Additionally, there was no proof that the accommodation had been granted because of Marcos,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> pointing out that the parties close or associated with the former president or his family were not specified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> Respondents Dee and Tengco claim that petitioner itself has admitted that Continental Manufacturing had settled its obligations to Development Bank. They state that in 1989, the corporation fully paid the bank P198,399,177.00, after which the Asset Privatization Trust then transferred back to Development Bank all its rights to and titles and interests in the account of Continental Manufacturing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> This was evidenced by the: (1) Deed of Conveyance dated March 14, 1989 between Asset Privatization Trust and Development Bank;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and (2) the Deed of Transfer dated March 15, 1989, where both parties expressly agreed that due to the transfer, Continental Manufacturing's obligation to Development Bank was deemed settled and paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p><p> Respondent Tengco further argues that the obligation Continental Manufacturing transferred to the national government in February 1987 was only P183,074,000.00, and the Deed of Reconveyance dated March 14, 1989 reveals that this account was fully paid and settled in the amount of P198,399,177.00. This shows that Development Bank even earned P2,210,000.00 as an investment banker. Thus, there could not have been any loss, damage, or injury caused to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p><p> For Section 3(g), respondents Dee and Tengco assert that petitioner did not substantiate its claim that the loans or any contract was grossly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> They maintain that there was no proof of criminal design, conspiracy, connivance, or collusion to cause injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p><p> Respondent Tengco claims that petitioner failed to specify Development Bank's exact participation in committing the alleged crimes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> He points out that it was not specifically alleged which among the bank's Board of Governors were present in the meetings that approved the loans and accommodations in Continental Manufacturing's favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, respondents Donald and Tengco posit that the loans were granted after due evaluation, with sound business judgment, and in accordance with its mandate, official functions, and acceptable banking practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Petitioner, they claim, failed to prove otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> </p><p> Respondent Donald explains that he sought loans and accommodations from Development Bank to continue Continental Manufacturing's operations, meet its client's requirements, and prevent its employees' dislocation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Respondent Tengco claims that the accommodations are forms of emergency rescue assistance granted after considering the following circumstances: (1) several business enterprises and industries' dependence on Continental Manufacturing's acrylic yarn; (2) the business enterprises and industries' capacity to generate foreign exchange earnings; and (3) the stoppage of Continental Manufacturing's operations, which will cause the dislocation of 27,000 workers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><p> Respondent Donald alleges that in exchange for the loan accommodations, he offered Development Bank the management of Continental Manufacturing and the assignment of export proceeds for the servicing of the loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Furthermore, he claims that before the loans were approved, the studies and evaluation had been exhaustive and intensive, with sound recommendations to ensure that Development Bank's interests were protected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> These may allegedly be seen in Development Bank's Office Correspondences,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> which laid out the terms and conditions of the loans and specifically identified the securities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></p><p> Respondent Donald further claims that per Development Bank's Office Correspondence dated October 6, 1982, Development Bank guaranteed Continental Manufacturing's loan with Citibank. This was because Citibank manifested that it was willing to hold foreclosing the mortgaged assets if Development Bank would issue a guaranty to restructure Continental Manufacturing's outstanding principal obligations.</p><p> Thus, Development Bank allegedly agreed to the guaranty because: (1) its collateral position on its financial exposures to Continental Manufacturing will improve by P19.1 million because of Citibank's surrender of the mortgaged properties amounting to P44.1 million and the loan of P25 million; (2) Development Bank's liability is only contingent on its books against hard assets, which had values sufficient to back up the guaranty liability making it a paper transaction with no immediate cash outlay from Development Bank; and (3) Development Bank also gained control over Continental Manufacturing's subsidiaries in issuing the guaranty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> </p><p> Respondent Tengco also argued that the loans and guaranty were also audited and found regular by the Central Bank of the Philippines (now BSP) and the Commission on Audit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> He explains that petitioner's figures on Continental Manufacturing's obligations to Development Bank were increased because of the peso devaluation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> which was not within the latter's control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Moreover, respondents Dee and Tengco claim that when Development Bank granted the loans and accommodations, it managed Continental Manufacturing, and thus, controlled the latter's Board of Directors, Management, and Executive Committee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> It also developed a rehabilitation plan with third parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> </p><p> Finally, respondent Tengco argues that without contrary evidence, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties should apply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Thus, their acts should be presumed regular and performed in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> He further argues that directors who act in good faith and within the scope of authority on behalf of the corporation do not become personally liable for the corporation's acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> In any case, since there was no injury caused, petitioner is left with no cause to file its Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></p><p> For this Court's resolution is the issue of whether or not public respondent Office of the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion when it found that the loans granted to Continental Manufacturing Corporation were not behest loans, thus finding no probable cause to charge respondents with violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p> This Court dismisses the Petition. Public respondent's finding of probable cause is entitled to great respect. </p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman is given a wide latitude of discretion when exercising its prosecutorial powers. Thus, this Court avoids intruding on its determination of probable cause. In <i>Ramiscal, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan</i>: <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> As the final word on the matter, the decision of the panel of prosecutors finding probable cause against petitioner prevails. This Court does not ordinarily interfere with the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause. The Ombudsman is endowed with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory prerogatives in the exercise of its power to pass upon criminal complaints. As this Court succinctly stated in <i>Alba v. Hon. Nitorreda</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> Moreover, this Court has consistently refrained from interfering with the exercise by the Ombudsman of his constitutionally mandated investigatory and prosecutory powers. Otherwise stated, it is beyond the ambit of this Court to review the exercise of discretion of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed before it. Such initiative and independence are inherent in the Ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and preserver of the integrity of the public service. </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Ocampo, IV v. Ombudsman</i>, the Court explained the rationale behind this policy, thus: </p> <p> The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they could be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the pmt of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Only when tainted with grave abuse of discretion will this Court reverse the Office of the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause.</p><p> Here, grave abuse of discretion means that public respondent's exercise of judgment or power was so capricious and whimsical, or arbitrary and despotic, as to amount to a lack or excess of jurisdiction. Its act must have been "so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> This Court has explained: </p><blockquote> <p> Ordinarily, the Court does not interfere with the Ombudsman's determination of the existence or non-existence of probable cause. The rule, however, does not apply if there is grave abuse of discretion, or if the action is done in a manner contrary to the dictates of the Constitution, law or jurisprudence. In these exceptional cases, the Ombudsman's action becomes subject to judicial review. </p> <p> The Ombudsman, in dismissing a complaint — whether for want of palpable merit or after the conduct of a preliminary investigation — carries the duty of explaining the basis for his action; he must determine that the complainant had failed to establish probable cause. </p> <p> The probable cause that a complainant has to establish need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt or evidence of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It simply implies probability of guilt and requires more than a bare suspicion but less than evidence that would justify a conviction. A finding of probable cause need only rest on evidence showing that more likely than not, a crime has been committed and was committed by the suspects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In the past, this Court has reversed the Office of the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause and found that it gravely abused its discretion when it required more than the required quantum of evidence to find probable cause. In the 2009 case of <i>Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> this Court noted that the conflicting accounts of the parties will be better ventilated in a full-blown trial: </p><blockquote> <p> The duty of the Ombudsman in the conduct of a preliminary investigation is to establish whether there exists probable cause to file an information in court against the accused. Considering the quantum of evidence needed to support a finding of probable cause, the Court holds that the Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion when he found such to be lacking here. </p> <p> Preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence. It is for the presentation of such evidence only as may engender a well-founded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof. The validity and merits of a party's accusation or defense, as well as admissibility of testimonies and evidence, are better ventilated during the trial proper: </p> <p> In the proceedings before the Ombudsman, the Committee and spouses Romualdez presented conflicting accounts. . . . Clearly, these conflicting claims of the parties should be resolved in a full-blown trial. </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> It bears stressing that a finding of probable cause needs only to rest on evidence showing that more likely than not, a crime was committed and was committed by the suspects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In the same case, this Court also ruled that the findings of the Committee on Behest Loans are entitled to great weight and respect: </p><blockquote> <p> It behooves the Ombudsman, while he asks the Court to respect his findings, to also accord a proper modicum of respect towards the expertise of the Committee, which was formed precisely to determine the existence of behest loans. Considering the membership of the Committee — representatives from the Department of Finance, the Philippine National Bank, the Asset Privatization Trust, the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation and even DBP itself — its recommendation should be given great weight. No doubt, the members of the Committee are experts in the field of banking. On account of their special knowledge and expertise, they are in a better position to determine whether standard banking practices are followed in the approval of a loan or what would generally constitute as adequate security for a given loan. Absent a substantial showing that their findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are conclusive and, in the interest of stability of the governmental structure, should not be disturbed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> However, in the 2010 case of <i>Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v.
