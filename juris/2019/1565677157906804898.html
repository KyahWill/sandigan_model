Specifically, the Ministry of National Defense, with prior approval of the President, leased the entire island of Corregidor to the Philippine Tourism Authority for one peso (P1.00). As for the Philippine Tourism Authority, it undertook to maintain and preserve the war relics on the island and to fully develop Corregidor's potential as an international and local tourist destination.

The Philippine Tourism Authority agreed to release to the Corregidor Foundation, Inc. its operating funds based on a budget for its approval. For its part, the Corregidor Foundation, Inc. agreed to submit a quarterly report on the receipts and disbursements of Philippine Tourism Authority funds.

Corregidor Foundation, Inc., according to the Adjudication and Settlement Board, is a non-stock corporation which receives funds from the government, through the Philippine Tourism Authority. The Adjudication and Settlement Board highlighted that Memorandum of Agreement dated September 3, 1996 provided that the funds received and disbursed by the Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is subject to the audit of the Internal Auditor of the Philippine Tourism Authority and the Commission on Audit. Finally, Corregidor Foundation, Inc. was deemed created for a public purpose, which is the maintenance and preservation of Corregidor.<br><br>Considering that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation, the Adjudication and Settlement Board held the foundation is subject to Budget Circular No. 2003-5 and 2003-02, limiting the grant of honoraria to specific government personnel, and Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution prohibiting double compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Adjudication and Settlement Board's Decision No. 2009-002 read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, this Board hereby <b>DENIES</b> the instant appeal for want of merit.

Given that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. was created by the State as its own instrumentality to carry out a governmental function, the Commission Proper concluded that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. should be considered a public corporation.<br><br>The Commission proper added that coverage under the Social Security System "is but a consequence of [Corregidor Foundation, Inc.'s] insistence that it is a private corporation, not <i>a priori</i> reason that it is."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing premises, the Commission Proper held that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation subject to Budget Circular No. 2003-5 and Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution.

The Commission on Audit, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> on June 25, 2014, to which Oriondo, Hernandez, Basco, Merino, and Salvador replied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> on October 7, 2014. Upon the directive of this Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the parties filed their respective Memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>According to petitioners, a cursory reading of Article IX-D, Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the Constitution reveals that the Commission on Audit has no power to determine whether an entity is a government-owned or controlled corporation. Petitioners maintain that the Commission on Audit had no jurisdiction to conduct a post-audit of Corregidor Foundation, Inc.'s disbursements on the basis of its own determination of Corregidor Foundation's status as a government-owned or controlled corporation. Consequently, the Commission's rulings on the grant of honoraria and cash gifts are allegedly null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On the threshold issue, petitioners insist that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is <i>not</i> a government-owned or controlled corporation due to the following reasons: (1) Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is neither organized as a stock corporation nor is it created by a special law or is governed by a charter created by a special law;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (2) Corregidor Foundation, Inc. was organized as a private corporation under the general corporation law, and its assets are allegedly its exclusive property, not government-owned;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (3) the personnel of Corregidor Foundation, Inc. are under the coverage of the Social Security System, further showing that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a private corporation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (4) its funds come primarily from grants and donations of international organizations and foreign entities, not from the National Government considering that its funding was never provided in the General Appropriations Act;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and (5) the quarterly reports submitted by Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is only based on its Memorandum of Agreement with the Philippine Tourism Authority, not because it is a government-owned or controlled corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Countering petitioners, respondent Commission on Audit first highlighted that the Petition was erroneously denominated as a "Petition for Review on Certiorari" under Rule 64 of the Rules of Court. "[T]here is no such thing as a Petition for Review under Rule 64,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> argued respondent Commission. The error notwithstanding, respondent Commission contends that the Petition should be treated as one for certiorari, specifically, to determine whether or not there was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission on Audit in disallowing the grant of honoraria and cash gifts to petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On whether or not it has the jurisdiction to determine whether an entity is a government-owned or controlled corporation, respondent Commission argues that it has the competence to make such determination. Pursuant to its constitutional duty to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and expenditures of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, respondent Commission maintains that the determination of the status of an entity as a government-owned or controlled corporation is but a "necessary incident to [the] performance of its duties and the discharge of its functions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Respondent Commission asserts its competency to determine the status of Corregidor Foundation, Inc. as a government-owned or controlled corporation, arguing that it only applied the law on the matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>On the principal issue of whether or not Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation, respondent Commission answers in the affirmative. It cites <i>Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) - Energy Development Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <i>and Philippine Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> where this Court enunciated the criteria for determining the status of a corporation as government-owned or controlled. Respondent Commission thereafter noted the circumstances demonstrating that all these criteria are present in this case. First, Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is under the Department of Tourism, created to develop the tourism in the island of Corregidor. Second, the incorporators of Corregidor Foundation, Inc. are all government officials and all of its trustees are public officials sitting in an <i>ex officio</i> capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Respondent Commission maintains that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. was created by the State to carry out a governmental function as shown by the following: (1) Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is substantially subsidized by the government, with 99.66% of its budget, as audited, coming from the Department of Tourism, Duty Free Philippines, and the Philippine Tourism Authority; (2) Corregidor Foundation, Inc.'s budget is subject to the prior approval of the Philippine Tourism Authority; (3) Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is required to submit a quarterly report on its receipts and disbursement of Philippine Tourism Authority funds; (4) all collections of revenues are deposited and taken up in the books of Corregidor Foundation, Inc. as accountability to the Philippine Tourism Authority; and (5) Corregidor Foundation, Inc. cannot encumber, mortgage, or alienate the premises subject of its Memorandum of Agreement with the Philippine Tourism Authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> These allegedly show that the disallowed amounts were public funds, which are definitely within the audit jurisdiction of respondent Commission; thus, there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission on Audit in issuing the Notice of Disallowance.<br><br>The issues for this Court's resolution are:<br><br>First, whether or not the Commission on Audit has jurisdiction to determine whether a corporation such as Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation; and<br><br>Second, whether or not Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation under the audit jurisdiction of the Commission on Audit.<br><br>The Petition is dismissed.<br><br>Respondent Commission on Audit did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing Notice of Disallowance No. CFI-2006-001. It has the competency to determine the status of corporations such as Corregidor Foundation, Inc. as government-owned or controlled, and correctly found that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is, indeed, a government-owned or controlled corporation under its audit jurisdiction.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>We first address respondent Commission's contention that petitioners erroneously referred to their Petition as a "Petition for Review on Certiorari" under Rule 64 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>A petition for review on certiorari is the remedy provided in Rule 45, Section 1 of the Rules of Court against an adverse judgment, final order, or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law:<br><blockquote><center><b>RULE 45</b><br><i>Appeal by Certiorari to the Supreme Court</i><br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Filing of Petition with Supreme Court</i>. - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.

Section 1 of Rule 64 defines the scope of the Rule, while section 2 refers to "Mode of Review" and provides that the judgments, final orders, and resolutions of the Commission on Audit are to be brought on certiorari to this Court under Rule 65. The pertinent provisions of Rules 64 and 65 are as follows:<br><blockquote><center><b>RULE 64</b><br><i>Review of Judgments and Final Orders or Resolutions of the Commission on Elections and the Commission on Audit</i><br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Scope</i>. — This Rule shall govern the review of judgments and final orders or resolutions of the Commission on Elections and the Commission on Audit.<br><br>SECTION 2. <i>Mode of Review</i>. — A judgment or final order or resolution of the Commission on Elections and the Commission on Audit may be brought by the aggrieved party to the Supreme Court on certiorari under Rule 65, except as hereinafter provided.<br><br>SECTION 3. <i>Time to File Petition</i>. — The petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed.

It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, and unless otherwise provided by law or these Rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The foregoing provisions readily reveal that a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 is an appeal and a true review that involves "digging into the merits and unearthing errors of judgment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> However, despite the repeated use of the word "review" in Rule 64, the remedy is principally one for certiorari that "deals exclusively with grave abuse of discretion, which may not exist even when the decision is otherwise erroneous."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>That the remedy against an adverse decision, order, or ruling of the Commission on Audit is a petition for certiorari, not review or appeal, is based on Article IX-A, Section 7 of the Constitution, thus:<br><br><center><b>ARTICLE IX</b><br><i>Constitutional Commissions</i><br></center><br><center>A. <i>Common Provisions</i><br></center></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">. . . .<br><br>SECTION 7.

Presidential Decree No. 2029, issued by then President Ferdinand E.

General Terms Defined. — Unless the specific words of the text, or the context as a whole, or a particular statute, shall require a different meaning:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">. . . .</td></tr><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(13) </div></td><td><div align="justify"><em>Government-owned or controlled corporation</em> refers to any agency organized as a stock or non-stock corporation, vested with functions relating to public needs whether governmental or proprietary in nature, and owned by the Government directly or through its instrumentalities either wholly, or, where applicable as in the case of stock corporations, to the extent of at least fifty-one (51) per cent of its capital stock: <em>Provided</em>, That government-owned or controlled corporations may be further categorized by the Department of the Budget, the Civil Service Commission, and the Commission on Audit for purposes of the exercise and discharge of their respective powers, functions and responsibilities with respect to such corporations.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In Republic Act No. 10149, otherwise known as the GOCC Governance Act of 2011, the term is defined in Section 3(o):<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. —<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">. . . .</td></tr><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(o)</div></td><td><div align="justify"><em>Government-Owned or -Controlled Corporation (GOCC)</em> refers to any agency organized as a stock or nonstock corporation, vested with functions relating to public needs whether governmental or proprietary in nature, and owned by the Government of the Republic of the Philippines directly or through its instrumentalities either wholly or, where applicable as in the case of stock corporations, to the extent of at least a majority of its outstanding capital stock: Provided, however, That for purposes of this Act, the term "GOCC" shall include GICP/GCE and GFI as defined herein.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Based on the above provisions, an entity is considered a government-owned or controlled corporation if all three (3) attributes are present: (1) the entity is organized as a stock or non-stock corporation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (2) its functions are public in character;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and (3) it is owned<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> or, at the very least, controlled<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> by the government.<br><br>Examples of government-owned or controlled corporations are the Leyte Metropolitan Water District and the Boy Scouts of the Philippines.

It performs a public service by providing water to its water district and, as a local water utility, it is controlled by the government considering that its directors are appointed by the head of the local government unit.

The second attribute—the public character of the corporation's functions—was therefore absent. It was in <i>Philippine Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</i> where the Court held that "[t]he true criterion. . . to determine whether a corporation is public or private is found in the totality of the relation of the corporation to the State,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> adding that "[if] the corporation is created by the State as the latter's own agency or instrumentality to help it in carrying out its governmental functions, then that corporation is public; otherwise, it is private."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The Manila Economic and Cultural Office is a non-stock corporation performing certain "'consular and other functions' relating to the promotion, protection and facilitation of Philippine interests in Taiwan."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> However, none of its members, officers or trustees were found to be government appointees or public officers designated by reason of their office.

Even a cursory reading of the statutory definitions of "government owned-or controlled corporation" readily reveals that a non-stock corporation may be government-owned or controlled.

So long as the government owns or controls the corporation, as in this case, the Commission on Audit may audit the corporation's accounts. In <i>Feliciano</i>:<br><blockquote>[T]he constitutional criterion on the exercise of [the Commission on Audit's] audit jurisdiction depends on the government's ownership or control of a corporation.

Addressing a similar argument, this Court in <i>Davao City Water District v.

Thus, in the case of <i>Lumanta v. NLRC</i> (G.R. No. 82819, February 8, 1989, 170 SCRA 79, 82), We held:<br><blockquote>"The Court, in National Service Corporation (NASECO) v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 69870, promulgated on 29 November 1988, quoting extensively from the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission in respect of the intent and meaning of the new phrase 'with original charter,' in effect held that <i>government-owned and controlled corporations with original charter refer to corporations chartered by special law as distinguished from corporations organized under our general incorporation statute - the Corporation Code</i>. In NASECO, the company involved had been organized under the general incorporation statute and was a subsidiary of the National Investment Development Corporation (NIDC) which in turn was a subsidiary of the Philippine National Bank, a bank chartered by a special statute. Thus, government-owned or controlled corporations like NASECO are effectively, excluded from the scope of the Civil Service."

Thus, these funds may be audited by the Commission on Audit. The Court elucidated in <i>Fernando v. Commission on Audit</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><blockquote>[D]espite the private source of funds, ownership over the same was already transmitted to the government by way of donation. As donee, the government had become the owner of the funds, with full ownership rights and control over the use and disposition of the same, subject only to applicable laws and COA rules and regulations. Thus, upon donation to the government, the funds became public in character.<br><br>This is in contrast to cases where there is no transfer of ownership over the funds from private parties to the government, such as in the case of cash deposits required in election protests filed before the trial courts, Commission on Elections, and electoral tribunals. In these cases, the government becomes a mere depositary of such fund, the use and disposition of which is subject to the conformity of the private party-depositor who remains to be the owner thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote>Lastly, while it is true that just like any other corporation organized under the Corporation Code, Corregidor Foundation, Inc. may determine voluntarily and solely the successors of its members in accordance with its own by-laws, this does not change the public character of its functions and the control the government has over it. As discussed, the promotion and development of tourism is a public function and, as provided in its Articles of Incorporation, the members of Corregidor Foundation, Inc. must be government officials who shall hold their membership by reason of their office.<br><br>In sum, Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation. Thus, it is under the audit jurisdiction of the Commission on Audit.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>There are cases where this Court, despite the disallowance by the Commission on Audit, nevertheless enjoined the refund of the disallowed amounts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> In these instances, this Court found that the parties received the disallowed amounts in good faith, defined as "that state of mind denoting honesty of intention, and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> It also means "an honest intention to abstain from taking any unconscientious disadvantage of another, even though technicalities of law, together with the absence of all information, notice, or benefit or belief of facts which render transactions unconscientious."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Here, we cannot ascribe good faith to petitioners in receiving the disallowed amounts. Department of Budget and Management Circular No. 2003-5 is clear that only the following are entitled to honoraria:<br><blockquote><b>4. General Guidelines<br></b><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">4.1.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> teaching personnel of the Department of Education, Commission on Higher Education, Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, State Universities and Colleges and other educational institutions engaged in actual classroom teaching whose teaching load is outside of the regular office hours and/or in excess of the regular load;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4.2 </div></td><td><div align="justify">those who act as lecturers, resource persons, coordinators and facilitators in seminars, training programs and other similar activities in training institutions, including those conducted by entities for their officials and employees; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4.3. </div></td><td><div align="justify">chairs and members of Commissions/Board Councils and other similar entities which are hereinafter referred to as a collegial body including the personnel thereof, who are neither paid salaries nor per diems but compensated in the form of honoraria as provided by law, rules and regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>It is obvious that Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is not an educational institution and petitioners are not its teaching personnel. Neither are petitioners lecturers by virtue of their positions in Corregidor Foundation, Inc. nor are there laws or rules allowing the payment of honoraria to personnel of the Corregidor Foundation, Inc.<br><br>Finally, petitioners knew fully well that they serve in Corregidor Foundation, Inc. by reason of their office in the Philippine Tourism Authority. It is also undisputed that petitioners, as officers and personnel of the Philippine Tourism Authority, already received honoraria and cash gifts. Considering that this Court pronounced as early as 1991 in <i>Civil Liberties Union v. The Executive Secretary</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> that an ex-officio position is "actually and in legal contemplation part of the principal office,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> receiving another set of honoraria and cash gift for rendering services to the Corregidor Foundation, Inc. would be tantamount to payment of additional compensation proscribed in Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution. These circumstances negate any claim of good faith.<br><br>The present case is different from <i>Blaquera v. Alcala</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> and <i>De Jesus v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> where this Court enjoined the refund of the disallowed amounts. Both cases had ostensible legal bases on which the recipients honestly believed that the disallowed amounts paid were due to them.<br><br>In <i>Blaquera</i>, productivity incentive benefits of not less than P2,000.00 were given to employees of the Philippine Tourism Authority in 1991. The grant was made on the basis of Administrative Order No. 268, series of 1992. The next year, productivity incentive benefits were again granted, but a subsequently issued Administrative Order No. 29, series of 1993 ordered a forced refund of productivity incentive benefits that were more than P1,000.00. This Court upheld the validity of Administrative Order No. 29, the latter's issuance being part of the power of control of the President. However, this Court enjoined the refund of the disallowed amounts because the employees received the benefits "in the honest belief that the amounts given were due. . . and the latter accepted the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> In <i>Blaquera</i>, Administrative Order No. 268 ostensibly authorized the payment of the productivity incentive benefits.<br><br>In <i>De Jesus</i>, allowances and bonuses were given to the members of the Interim Board of Directors of the Catbalogan Water District on the basis of the Local Water Utilities Administration's Resolution No. 313, series of 1995. The Commission on Audit disallowed the payment because, according to Section 13 of the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973, directors of local water utilities shall only receive per diems. This Court affirmed the disallowance but held that the recipients "need not refund the [disallowed] allowances and bonus they received[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> In <i>De Jesus</i>, Local Water Utilities Administration's Resolution No. 313, series of 1995 ostensibly authorized the payment of the allowances and bonuses.<br><br>Unlike in <i>Blaquera</i> and <i>De Jesus</i>, no such ostensible legal basis was presented in this case. There was no reason for petitioners to honestly believe that another set of honoraria and cash gifts, by reason of their ex-officio positions in Corregidor Foundation, Inc., were due them. It cannot be said that they received the disallowed amounts in good faith.<br><br>All told, Corregidor Foundation, Inc. is a government-owned or controlled corporation. It is subject to Department of Budget and Management Circular No. 2003-5 limiting the payment of honoraria to certain personnel of the government. Furthermore, petitioners, being employees of the Philippine Tourism Authority, are public officers prohibited from receiving additional, double or indirect compensation as per Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution. The Commission on Audit did not gravely abuse its discretion in disallowing the payment of honoraria and cash gift to petitioners.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Certiorari is <b>DISMISSED</b>. <br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Bersamin, C.
