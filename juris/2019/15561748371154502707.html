Parina, Giporlos, Eastern Samar, with an assessed value of P950.00 (subject land).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Respondents claimed that the subject land was a portion of a bigger parcel of land originally owned by their grandfather, Marcelino Paller (Marcelino). After the latter's death, or sometime in 1929 or 1932, his children, Ambrosio Paller (Ambrosio),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Isidra Paller (Isidra), and Ignacia Paller (Ignacia),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> along several others,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> orally partitioned his properties and took possession of their respective shares.<br><br>From Marcelino's estate, respondents' father, <b>Ambrosio, </b>was given about one (1) hectare of the subject land, in addition to a smaller property situated in Sitio Dungon, Brgy. 07; while <b>Isidra </b>was given two (2) hectares as her rightful share. After Isidra's death, her son, Juan Duevo (Juan), sold the two (2)-hectare land to Ambrosio's wife and respondents' mother, Sabina Macawile (Sabina). Through succession upon their parents' death, respondents alleged that the subject land was passed on to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On the other hand, the Custodios' predecessor-in-interest and petitioners' grandmother, <b>Ignacia, </b>was assigned two (2) parcels of land situated in Sitio Dungon, Brgy. 07 and Sitio Bangalog, Brgy. Parina as her share.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In 1995, respondent Demetria, daughter of Ambrosio, mortgaged the subject land to Felix R. Aide with right to repurchase. Upon her return from Manila in 2000, she redeemed the same but discovered that the Custodios took possession of the land and refused to vacate therefrom despite demands; hence, the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In their Answer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Custodios claimed to be legitimate and compulsory heirs of Marcelino who can validly and legally possess the subject land which has not been partitioned, and thus, commonly owned by his heirs. They further averred that Ambrosio is not a child of Marcelino and, as such, has no right to claim the subject land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>To support respondents' claim that Ambrosio is a child of Marcelino and Susana Paller, they presented before the MCTC a copy of Ambrosio's baptismal certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> indicating that his father was Marcelino;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> however, his mother was reflected therein as "Talampona Duevo"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Talampona). On the other hand, to establish their acquisition of the two (2)-hectare portion, they adduced a copy of the unnotarized deed of sale dated May 3, 1959 in <i>waray </i>dialect denominated as <i>"Documento Hin Pag Guibotongan Hin Cadayunan"</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (unnotarized deed of sale) purportedly covering the sale of the said portion by Juan to respondents' mother, Sabina, who, however, was described therein as married to "Marcos Paller" (Marcos),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> not to Ambrosio. To explain the discrepancies in the names reflected in the above documents, Miguel explained that "Ambrosio" and "Talampona" are the real names, and that "Marcos" and "Susana" were mere aliases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Custodios filed a Demurrer to Evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated July 20, 2008, averring that respondents failed to establish their claim that Ambrosio is a son of Marcelino, pointing out: <i>(a) </i>the discrepancies in the names indicated in their pleadings and the documentary evidence they presented; and <i>(b) </i>the lack of documents/evidence other than Ambrosio's baptismal certificate to prove his filiation to Marcelino. Thus, they contended that respondents cannot claim to have lawfully and validly acquired the subject land by right of representation from Ambrosio. They further pointed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> out that respondents' evidence failed to prove not only their ownership of the subject land, but likewise the identity of the land they seek to recover, considering the different boundaries reflected in the unnotarized deed of sale and the tax declarations (TD) they presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>However, the Demurrer to Evidence was denied in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated October 24, 2008, and the Custodios were allowed to present their evidence.<br><br><center><b>The MCTC Ruling</b></center><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated November 12, 2012, the MCTC declared respondents as the lawful owners of the subject land, and ordered the Custodios to surrender the ownership and physical possession of the subject land, and to pay actual damages, attorney's fees, and the costs of suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It gave weight to the baptismal certificate as sufficient and competent proof of Ambrosio's filiation with Marcelino which the Custodios failed to successfully overthrow.
