				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is an ordinary appeal filed by accused-appellant, William Sabalberino, assailing the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals <i>(CA),</i> dated May 31, 2017 and January 29, 2018, respectively, in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02230. The CA Decision affirmed, with modification, the February 24, 2016 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court <i>(RTC) </i> of Tacloban City, Branch 6, in Criminal Case No. 2005-08-446, finding herein accused-appellant guilty of the crime of parricide and imposing upon him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to pay damages. The CA Resolution denied accused-appellant's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>The antecedents are as follows:<br><br>On August 19, 2005, the City Prosecutor of Tacloban filed an Information with the RTC of Tacloban City, charging accused-appellant with the crime of Parricide. The accusatory portion of the Information reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 17<sup>th</sup> day of August, 2005, in the City of Tacloban, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously stab his wife DELIA FERNANDEZ-SABALBERINO with a knife, hitting her on the chest and heart thereby inflicting upon the person of Delia Fernandez-Sabalberino a mortal wound which was the direct and immediate cause of her death<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Upon arraignment on March 21, 2006, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Subsequently, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution established that herein accused-appellant, William Sabalberino <i>(William)</i> and the victim, Delia Fernandez-Sabalberino <i>(Delia)</i> were husband and wife who used to live together at Barangay 59, Picas, Sagkahan, Tacloban City. William was employed as a painter, while Delia worked as a laundrywoman. They have five (5) children, namely, Wendel, Wedylyn, William, Angela and Jessica. Around one o'clock in the morning of August 17, 2005, Angela and Jessica were roused from their sleep when they heard their parents shouting at each other. They were prompted to get out of bed and, thereafter, stood by the door of their room while witnessing their parents argue with each other. While in the middle of their quarrel, William punched Delia hitting her face. Angela and Jessica then rushed to their mother and embraced her. Thereafter, William went to the kitchen to get a knife and proceeded to stab Delia hitting her chest below the armpit while the latter was holding Angela and Jessica. Delia, on the other hand, managed to stand and walk towards the door of their house. However, before reaching the door, she decided to walk back towards the bed but before she could make it to the bed she collapsed. William then went to her aid, embraced her and cried. He asked his children to call for help, but Delia died soon thereafter.<br><br>William, on his part, did not deny having stabbed Delia. However, he claimed that the stabbing was accidental. William alleged that in the afternoon of August 16, 2005, he arrived home tired and took a nap while waiting for his daughters to prepare their meal. He woke up around 6:30 in the evening and took dinner with his children. When he inquired about his wife, their children told him that she was still washing clothes. After eating, he went to sleep inside the master's bedroom. Around midnight, he woke up to urinate. Upon turning on the lights and stepping out of their bedroom, he saw his wife half naked with a completely naked man on top of her. Angry at what he saw, he went to the kitchen to get a knife and approached the two. His wife and the man then stood up, and the latter tried to gain possession of the knife. They grappled. When William was able to take control of the knife, he tried to stab the man but, unfortunately, he accidentally hit his wife who at that time stood between him and the man. The man then picked up his clothes and hurriedly jumped out of their window. William tried to run after him, but he came to the aid of his wife when he saw her fall down. He then asked his children to call for help, but his wife died before help arrived.<br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered judgment convicting accused-appellant as charged. The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing considerations, this Court finds accused <b>WILLIAM</b> <b>SABALBERINO</b> <b>y</b> <b>ABULENCIA</b> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of <b>RECLUSION PERPETUA</b>; and, to pay the heirs of the victim, Delia Fernandez Sabalberino, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 for moral damages. To pay the Costs.<br><br><b>SO</b> <b>ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The RTC ruled that after accused-appellant admitted that it was he who stabbed his wife, the trial court, nonetheless, was not convinced that the stabbing was accidental because the evidence was contrary to accused-appellant's claim that his intention was to stab the man whom he caught as having sexual intercourse with his wife. The RTC gave credence to the separate testimonies of the daughters of accused-appellant and the victim that they did not see any man having sexual intercourse with their mother immediately prior to the stabbing incident and that their parents were, in fact, in the middle of an argument and quarrel when their father stabbed their mother.<br><br>Aggrieved by the ruling of the RTC, accused-appellant appealed to the CA praying for his acquittal and the reversal of the assailed RTC Decision. In his Appellant's Brief, accused-appellant reiterated his defense that the stabbing of his wife was accidental. Reiterating the provisions of Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code <i>(RPC),</i> accused-appellant stood by his claim that he caught his wife having carnal knowledge with another man; that his intention was to kill that man with a knife but since his wife stood between him and the man, it was his wife who was accidentally stabbed. Accused-appellant also contends that, even granting that he failed to prove his innocence under Article 247 of the RPC, the trial court, nonetheless, erred in imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i> as it failed to appreciate the mitigating circumstances of: (1) having acted upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion or obfuscation; (2) voluntary surrender; and (3) lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed.<br><br>In its assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the conviction of accused-appellant, but modified the judgment of the RTC by ordering accused-appellant to pay the heirs of Delia temperate and exemplary damages, an increased amount of moral damages and interest on the monetary awards. The CA disposed, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated February 24, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 6, Tacloban City, in Criminal Case No. 2005-08-446, finding appellant William Sabalberino y Abulencia, guilty beyond reasonable doubt [of] the crime of Parricide is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:<br><br><table Â ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The award of moral damages is increased to P75,000.00;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">2)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant is ordered to indemnify the victim's heirs temperate damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">3)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Interest at the rate of 6% per annum should be imposed on all damages awarded from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The rest of the decision not inconsistent with these pronouncements STANDS.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The CA held that the prosecution was able to prove the presence of all the elements of parricide and that accused-appellant failed to convince the appellate court of the merits of his defenses.<br><br>Accused-appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> reiterating his defenses, but the CA denied it in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated January 29, 2018.<br><br>Thus, on March 16, 2018, accused-appellant, through counsel, filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> manifesting his intention to appeal the CA Decision to this Court.<br><br>In its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated June 22, 2018, the CA noted and gave due course to accused-appellant's Notice of Appeal and directed its Judicial Records Division to transmit the entire records of the case to this Court.<br><br>Hence, this appeal was instituted.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated November 5, 2018, this Court, among others, notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desire.<br><br>In its Manifestation and Motion,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> filed on January 22, 2019, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) manifested that, in lieu of a Supplemental Brief, it adopts its Appellee's Brief filed before the CA as it "already sufficiently affirms accused-appellant's guilt of the crime of Parricide." The OSG prayed that: (1) it be excused from filing a Supplemental Brief;. (2) the assailed CA Decision be affirmed <i>in toto;</i> and (3) accused-appellant's appeal be dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>In the same manner, accused-appellant filed a Manifestation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> submitting that he is adopting the Brief for the Accused-Appellant, which he filed with the CA, as his Supplemental Brief since the Brief filed with the CA had "adequately presented and discussed all the issues" respecting his innocence.<br><br>The basic issue for the Court's resolution in the present appeal is whether or not the CA correctly upheld the conviction of herein accused-appellant, William Sabalberino, for parricide.<br><br>The Court rules in the affirmative.<br><br>Parricide is committed when: (1) a person is killed; (2) the deceased is killed by the accused; (3) the deceased is the father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or a legitimate other ascendants or other descendants, or the legitimate spouse of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the present case, there was no dispute that the victim, Delia Sabalberino, was killed as shown by her Certificate of Death stating that the cause of death was "shock and hemorrhage intrathoracic due to stab wound of the left side of the chest, hitting the heart."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The said Certificate was admitted by the RTC and the defense did not object to its admissibility.<br><br>Also, the prosecution was able to satisfactorily establish that it was herein appellant who stabbed and killed Delia based on the eyewitnesses' account.

Both courts held that accused-appellant's uncorroborated claim pales in comparison to the consistent testimonies of their daughters, Angela and Jessica, that at the time of the stabbing incident, and immediately prior thereto, no person, other than the family members, was inside their house and that the killing of the victim was immediately preceded by an argument between her and accused-appellant. This Court, likewise, agrees with both the RTC and the CA that the defense failed to prove that the accused-appellant's and the victim's daughters were motivated by malice or ill-will in testifying against their father. As such, the testimonies of Angela and Jessica, having been found credible by the RTC and the CA, are sufficient to establish the guilt of accused-appellant.<br><br>Time and again, the Court has held that when the issues involve matters of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies, and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This is so because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses and is in the best position to discern whether they are telling the truth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The factual findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive on this Court, except under specific instances<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which this Court finds to be absent in the instant case.<br><br>Accused-appellant also invokes the mitigating circumstances of passion and obfuscation, lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed and voluntary surrender, which the court finds to be unavailing.<br><br>It has been held that there is passional obfuscation when the crime was committed due to an uncontrollable burst of passion provoked by prior unjust or improper acts, or due to a legitimate stimulus so powerful as to overcome reason.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The obfuscation must originate from lawful feelings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The turmoil and unreason which naturally result from a quarrel or fight should not be confused with the sentiment or excitement in the mind of a person injured or offended to such a degree as to deprive him of his sanity and self-control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The excitement which is inherent in all persons who quarrel and come to blows does not constitute obfuscation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In the present case, the prosecution was able to establish that the crime was precipitated by a quarrel between accused-appellant and the victim. However, such kind of argument, no matter how heated or serious it was, is not the kind that would cause the passion or obfuscation contemplated under the law.<br><br>As to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the same can be appreciated if the accused satisfactorily complies with three requisites, to wit: (1) he has not been actually arrested; (2) he surrendered himself to a person in authority or the latter's agent; and (3) the surrender is voluntary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> There must be a showing of spontaneity and an intent to surrender unconditionally to the authorities, either because the accused acknowledges his guilt or he wishes to spare them the trouble and expense concomitant to his capture.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the instant case, there was no showing of spontaneity on the part of accused-appellant as it was not he who asked for the police to go to their house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Neither was there proof that he acknowledged his guilt when apprehended by the police authorities. While it appears that he did not resist when the police officers brought him to the police station for questioning, such lack of resistance does not necessarily equate to his voluntary surrender. The voluntariness of one's surrender should denote a positive act and not a mere compliant or submissive behavior in the presence of authorities.<br><br>Anent the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong as that committed, this circumstance addresses itself to the intention of the offender at the particular moment when such offender executes or commits the criminal act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In the instant case, the undeniable fact is that when accused-appellant attacked the victim, the former used a deadly weapon and inflicted a mortal wound on the latter. While intent to kill is purely a mental process, it may be inferred from the weapon used, the extent of the injuries sustained by the offended party and the circumstances of the aggression, as well as the fact that the accused performed all the acts that should have resulted in the death of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Indeed the location and nature of Delia's stab wound belie accused-appellant's claim of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong against the victim.<br><br>As to the penalty, this Court agrees with the CA and the RTC in imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in accordance with the provisions of Article 246 of the RPC, in relation to Article 63 of the same Code. As to the award of damages, this Court, likewise, agrees with the CA in awarding separate amounts of P75,000.00 each for civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 as temperate damages, all of which are subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) <i>per annum </i>from the finality of this Decision until fully paid, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>DISMISSED.</b> The Decision dated May 31, 2017, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
