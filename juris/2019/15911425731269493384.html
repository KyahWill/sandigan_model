LBP stresses that petitioners are liable not as guarantors but as sureties of DPICI's&nbsp; debts,&nbsp; and, consequently,&nbsp; are&nbsp; directly&nbsp; and&nbsp; absolutely bound&nbsp; with DPICI as principal&nbsp; debtor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> LBP also finds no error committed&nbsp; by the CA when it refused to treat the Asian economic crisis in 1997 as <i>force majeure</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> petitioners assert that there was an agreement to restructure the loan albeit&nbsp; LBP abruptly&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that their&nbsp; loan&nbsp; already&nbsp; became due without consulting&nbsp; the account officer handling petitioners' loan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Because of the agreement&nbsp; to restructure, petitioners&nbsp; contend&nbsp; that DPICI's loan was not yet due; thus, Jacinto et al.'s liability as sureties has yet to arise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Again, petitioners allege that they do not seek to evade liability, they only seek that the restructuring&nbsp; of the loan agreement&nbsp; be implemented&nbsp; as their failure to pay was brought about by the economic crisis over which petitioners had no control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><div align="center"><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></div><br>For lack of merit, we deny the petition.<br><br>Only questions&nbsp; of law should&nbsp; be raised in Rule&nbsp; 45 petitions&nbsp; as this Court is not a trier of facts and will not entertain questions of fact as factual findings of the CA and trial courts are final, binding, or conclusive on the parties, and on this Court when supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The issues raised by petitioners in this petition are a virtual rehash, if not a verbatim reproduction,&nbsp; of the issues raised before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Whether the parties&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; restructuring&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan,&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; amounts sought to&nbsp; be&nbsp; collected by&nbsp; LBP&nbsp; are&nbsp; much higher than DPICI's loan obligations, and whether petitioners bound themselves&nbsp; as sureties under the Comprehensive Surety Agreement, are questions of fact which have all been settled by the courts below.<br><br>As in all general rules, the rule that only questions of law may be entertained in a petition for review also permits&nbsp; exceptions. As enumerated in <i>Pascual v. Burgos:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>However, these rules do admit exceptions. Over time, the exceptions to&nbsp; these rules have expanded. At&nbsp; present, there are 10&nbsp; recognized exceptions that were first listed in <i>Medina v.

There was no evidence, documentary&nbsp; or testimonial,&nbsp; to prove the existence of the alleged agreement by the parties to restructure. Allegations are not evidence and without&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; bare&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; do not&nbsp; prove&nbsp; facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> At most, the letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; presented by LBP proves that there was a proposal on the part of the petitioners to restructure&nbsp; the loan, but that said proposal&nbsp; was nevertheless denied by LBP.&nbsp; Hence, what this settles is that LBP did not give its consent to the proposed restructuring; as such, there was no restructuring to speak of.<br><br>Petitioners'&nbsp; argument that LBP was at fault for not having consulted its&nbsp; account&nbsp; officer&nbsp; before&nbsp; collecting&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan&nbsp; is,&nbsp; at&nbsp; best,&nbsp; specious.&nbsp; The account officer merely keeps track of records pertinent to the account. By no measure is the account officer a party to the loan agreement which is strictly between LBP and petitioners.<br><br>Anent petitioners' argument that the amount sought to be collected by LBP was much higher than its total obligations, suffice to say that the lower courts uniformly determined that even after the application of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, there remained a balance on the loan obligation in the amount of P166,853,078.57.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Quite glaringly, petitioners did not bother to disprove this finding by offering contrary proof.<br><br>In the same manner, we sustain&nbsp; the finding that Jacinto,&nbsp; et al., are liable as sureties. In&nbsp; fact, petitioners&nbsp; do not deny&nbsp; their liability as sureties under&nbsp; the Comprehensive&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; Agreement,&nbsp; but&nbsp; nevertheless&nbsp; argue&nbsp; that their liability arises only when the collaterals used to secure the obligation proved to be insufficient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The&nbsp; terms of&nbsp; the Comprehensive Surety Agreement itself, which petitioners knowingly and intelligently entered into, belie<br>such contention:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the BANK has granted to DUTY-PAID&nbsp; IMPORT CO., INC.&nbsp; (Save-a-Lot)&nbsp; (hereinafter&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; BORROWER) certain loans, credits, advances, and other credit facilities or accommodations&nbsp; up to a principal amount of PESOS:&nbsp; TWO&nbsp; HUNDRED&nbsp; FIFTY MILLION PESOS, (P250,000,000.00), Philippine Currency, (the OBLIGATIONS) with a condition, among others, that a joint and several liability undertaking be executed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; SURETY&nbsp; for the&nbsp; due&nbsp; and punctual&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of all loans, credits, advances, and other credit facilities or<br>accommodations of the BORROWER due and payable to the BANK and for the faithful and prompt performance of any or all the terms and conditions thereof.<br><br>WHEREAS,&nbsp; the SURETY has, for a valuable consideration&nbsp; received from the BORROWER agreed to irrevocably, unconditionally&nbsp; and jointly and severally undertake/guarantee the OBLIGATIONS.<br><br>&nbsp;x x x x<br><br>14. Upon any default, the BANK may proceed directly against the SURETY without first proceeding against and without exhausting the<br>property of the BORROWER;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)</blockquote>Thus,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Comprehensive Surety&nbsp; Agreement, Jacinto, et al., become immediately liable upon DPICI's&nbsp; default without the need for LBP to first proceed against, and, exhaust the collaterals offered by DPICI.<br><br>Finally, petitioners'&nbsp; plea to be absolved of liability on account of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, deserves scant consideration. Upon the petitioners rest the burden of proving that its financial distress which it claim to have suffered was the proximate cause of its inability to comply with its obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The loan agreement was entered into on November 19, 1997, or well after the start of the Asian economic crisis. Petitioners&nbsp; ought to be aware of the economic environment at that time, yet it chose to contract said obligations from LBP. It was a business judgment that entailed certain risks. In any case, the 1997 financial crisis that ensued in Asia did not constitute a valid justification to renege on one's obligations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; and it is not among the fortuitous events contemplated under Article 1174 of the New Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In all, we find no error on the part of the appellate court necessitating the Court's exercise of its discretionary review power under Rule 45.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED.</b>&nbsp; The Decision dated June 29, 2017 and Resolution&nbsp; dated March 20, 2018 of the Court of Appeals are<b> AFFIRMED<i> in toto.</i></b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.J., (chairperson), Caguioa, (working chairperson), Reyes, J.
