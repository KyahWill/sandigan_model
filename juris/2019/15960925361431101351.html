Added to all this, it took nine&nbsp; years&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp; rape&nbsp; incident,&nbsp; and&nbsp; five&nbsp; years&nbsp; from the&nbsp; second incident, for AAA to report the rape.<sup><font color="#FF0000">[31]</font></sup><br><br>Similarly, XXX surmises that the lacerations in AAA's hymen could have been caused by other factors.<sup><font color="#FF0000">[32]</font></sup><br><br>Furthermore, XXX points out that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of force and intimidation.&nbsp; AAA admitted that he did not force or intimidate her into committing the sexual acts.&nbsp; Although she claimed that XXX threatened her, these threats were allegedly done after the commission of the rape, and thus, could not have been sufficient to subdue her.<sup><font color="#FF0000">[33]</font></sup><br><br>Anent BBB's accusation, XXX claims that he could not have sexually abused her on December 2, 2006, considering that at that time, BBB was already living with DDD, while he was living alone in a makeshift house in Iriga City.<sup><font color="#FF0000">[34]</font></sup><br><br>XXX likewise claims that the prosecution failed to prove all the elements for violation of Section 5(b), Article III of R.A.
