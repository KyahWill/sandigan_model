Respondents also averred that petitioners committed grave misrepresentation when they submitted the certificate of registration and license to sell issued by the NHA as purportedly covering the subject properties. In refutation, respondents submitted an HLURB Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated August 15, 2006, certifying that the certificate of registration and license to sell issued by the NHA in 1977, covered only a total area of 66,375 square meters which is a consolidation subdivision of 3 parcels of lot, namely: (a) Lot No. 1225 covered by TCT-29809 with an area of 5,036 square meters; (b) Lot No. 1226 covered by TCT No. NT-43300 with an area of 1,693 square meters; and (c) Lot No. 1227 covered by TCT No. NT-15456 with an area of 59,646 square meters.<br><br>In rebuttal, petitioners submitted new evidence in the form of an Affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> executed by a retired MPDC to the effect that the properties are within the residential area.<br><br><div align="center"><b>The Order of the DAR Secretary</b><br></div><br>Because of the HLURB Certification dated August 15, 2006, the CLUPPI Committee recommended the denial of the application for exemption. Approving the CLUPPI Committee's recommendation, the DAR Secretary denied petitioners' application for exemption in his Order dated March 21, 2007, and disposed as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered the application for Exemption Clearance pursuant to DAR Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 2003, involving six (6) parcels of land with an aggregate area of 114.7030 hectares, located in Barangay San Mariano, San Antonio Nueva Ecija is hereby <b>DENIED. </b>The Municipal and the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officers are hereby directed to continue with the documentation of the said landholdings pursuant to pertinent and applicable agrarian laws, and thereafter to cause the immediate distribution of the same to the qualified Beneficiaries.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioners moved for reconsideration on the grounds that the HLURB's Certification dated August 15, 2006, pertained to other landholdings likewise registered in the names of petitioners, and that the respondents had no personality to oppose. Thus, in rebuttal, petitioners submitted an HLURB Certification dated March 29, 2007, stating that the lands described in its Certification dated August 15, 2006, are different from the lands sought to be exempted from CARP coverage. It is also therein stated that the subject landholdings are within the urban residence and were reclassified as residential by the NHA prior to June 15, 1988, as ratified and approved by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>of San Antonio, Nueva Ecija in its Resolution No. 2006-004.<br><br>Respondents opposed the motion for reconsideration and submitted another HLURB Certification dated April 25, 2007, stating that the town plan and zoning ordinance of San Antonio, Nueva Ecija was not yet approved by the HLURB, and reiterating that the certificate of registration and license to sell covered only an area of 66,375 square meters. The HLURB Certification dated April 25, 2007, further nullified inconsistent HLURB issuances previously issued, specifically the HLURB Certification dated September 12, 2005, (to the effect that there exists a valid NHA-issued certificate of registration and license to sell covering the properties) and HLURB Certification dated March 29, 2007 (stating that the lands were reclassified as residential by the NHA prior to June 15, 1988, as ratified under <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Resolution No. 2006-004).<br><br>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was denied by the DAR Secretary in his Order dated February 4, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This prompted an appeal to the OP.<br><br><div align="center"><b>The OP's Decision</b><br></div><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated March 1, 2010, the OP reversed the Orders of the DAR Secretary, and, instead granted petitioners' application for exemption.<br><br>According to the OP, the HLURB Certification dated August 15, 2006, is not fatal to petitioners' application because while said certification confirms that only 66,375 square meters of the Celia Subdivision was issued a certificate of registration and license to sell, such does not necessarily mean that the subject properties are no longer urban and residential.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The OP also reasoned that the HLURB Certification dated August 15, 2006, by itself, is not conclusive evidence to warrant the denial of petitioners' application for exemption. It pointed out that DAR Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 4, series of 2003, prescribing the rules on exemption of lands from the coverage of CARL, enumerates other documents that must be submitted when applying for exemption.<br><br>Thus, the OP gave weight to the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Resolution No. 2006-004 dated March 15, 2006, as proof that the properties were classified as residential lands; the Field Inspection Report of the CLUPPI showing that the properties adjoin residential lands, near the hospital and connected to the municipal and provincial roads; Certifications from the MARO and PARO attesting that the landholdings are untenanted; Certifications from NIA stating that the properties are not irrigated nor included in the area with programmed irrigation; and Certification from the DA stating that the properties are not viable for agricultural development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The OP also relied on the observations contained in the DARAB Decision dated October 14, 2004, that the properties are residential in nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In all, the OP held that petitioners have satisfactorily proven by substantial evidence that the subject properties are residential and not agricultural lands, and ruled:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the assailed Orders dated 21 March 2007 and 4 February 2008 of the Department of Agrarian Reform are hereby <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE </b>and, in lieu thereof, a new judgment rendered <b>GRANTING </b>appellants' application for exemption of their titled landholdings from the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL).<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Respondents moved for reconsideration but this was denied by the OP in a Resolution dated May 27, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> With this denial, respondents elevated the case to the CA.<br><br><div align="center"><b>The CA's Decision</b><br></div><br>The CA narrowed the issue to be resolved as to whether the subject properties were classified as residential before June 15, 1988, or the effectivity of the CARL, and are therefore, exempt from its coverage.<br><br>The CA noted discrepancies in the documents submitted by petitioners to support their application for exemption. It observed that the HLURB Certification dated September 12, 2005, (stating that the NHA issued a certificate of registration and license to sell over the subject properties) was inconsistent with the HLURB Certification dated August 15, 2006 (stating that the certificate of registration and license to sell covered other lots).<br><br>Further, the CA doubted the veracity of <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Resolution No. 2006-004, purportedly ratifying the reclassification of the subject properties as residential because the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>itself issued a Certification dated August 2, 2010, denying the existence of such Resolution. Likewise, the Office of the Vice-Governor of the Province of Nueva Ecija issued a Certification dated July 21, 2010, stating that <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Resolution No. 2006-004 pertained to the riprapping of the Along-Along creek.<br><br>The CA also considered respondents' documentary evidence consisting of the HLURB Certification dated April 25, 2007, which nullified the previous HLURB Certifications presented by petitioners and the letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated September 6, 2006, issued by the MPDC stating that there was no record as to the classification of the subject properties prior to June 15, 1988, and that said properties were classified as agricultural based on the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance approved by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>and the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan </i>on July 22, 2002, and September 23, 2002, respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Given these, the CA concluded that petitioners failed to prove by substantial evidence that the subject properties were classified as residential prior to the effectivity of the CARL, and are therefore, not exempt from its coverage.<br><br>In disposal, the CA held:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

These matters, however, no longer bear any significance in the light of the certifications of the Deputized Zoning Administrator and the HUDCC testifying to the non-agricultural nature of the landholding in question.<br><br><b>The CARL, as amended, is unequivocal that only lands devoted to agricultural activity and not classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land are within its scope. Thus, the slope of the land or the fact of its being irrigated or non-irrigated becomes material only if the land is agricultural, for purposes of exempting the same from the coverage of the agrarian law. However, if the land is non-agricultural — as is the case of the property here under consideration — the character and topography of the land lose significance.</b><br><br>It must likewise be emphasized that, since zoning ordinances are based not only on the present, but also on the future projection of needs of a local government unit, when a zoning ordinance is passed, the local legislative council obviously takes into consideration the prevailing conditions in the area where the land subject of reclassification is situated.<br><br>Accordingly, when the then <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>of Calapan enacted Ordinance No. 21, there is reasonable ground to believe that the district subject of the reclassification, including its environs, was already developing.

Municipality of Tarlac, </i>thus:<br><br>The appellant argues that Ordinance No. 1 is a zoning ordinance which the Municipal Council is authorized to adopt. McQuillin in his treaties on Municipal Corporations (Volume 8, 3rd ed.) says:<br><blockquote>Zoning is governmental regulation of the uses of land and buildings according to districts or zones. It is comprehensive where it is governed by a single plan for the entire municipality and prevails throughout the municipality in accordance with that plan. It is partial or limited where it is applicable only to a certain part of the municipality or to certain uses. Fire limits, height districts and building regulations are forms of partial or limited zoning or use regulation that are antecedents of modern comprehensive zoning.<br><br>The term "zoning," ordinarily used with the connotation of comprehensive or general zoning, refers to governmental regulation of the uses of land and buildings according to districts or zones. This regulation must and does utilize classification of uses within districts as well as classification of districts, inasmuch as it manifestly is impossible to deal specifically with each of the innumerable uses made of land and buildings. Accordingly, (zoning has been defined as the confining of certain classes of buildings and uses to certain localities, areas, districts or zones.) It has been stated that zoning is the regulation by districts of building development and uses of property, and that the term "zoning" is not only capable of this definition but has acquired a technical and artificial meaning in accordance therewith. (Zoning is the separation of the municipality into districts and the regulation of buildings and structures within the districts so created, in accordance with their construction, and nature and extent of their use. It is a dedication of districts delimited to particular uses designed to subserve the general welfare.) Numerous other definitions of zoning more or less in accordance with these have been given in the cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Internal citations omitted and emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br>The Local Autonomy Act of 1959, the precursor of the Local Government Code of 1991, provides for the power of municipal councils to adopt zoning and planning ordinances as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Additional Powers of Provincial Boards, Municipal Boards or City Councils and Municipal and Regularly Organized Municipal District Councils. –</i><br><br>&nbsp;x x x x<br><br><i>Power to adopt zoning and planning ordinances. - </i>Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, Municipal Boards or City Councils in cities, and Municipal Councils in municipalities are hereby authorized to adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances or regulations for their respective cities and municipalities subject to the approval of the City Mayor or Municipal Mayor, as the case may be. Cities and municipalities may, however, consult the National Planning Commission on matters pertaining to planning and zoning.<br></blockquote><br>The Local Government Code of 1991 mirrors the power of the municipal council, as the legislative body of the municipality, to adopt a comprehensive land use plan for the general welfare of the municipality and its inhabitants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Thus, Section 447 of the Local Government Code of 1991, provides:<br><br><blockquote>(2) Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the municipality as provided for under Section 18 of this Code with particular attention to agro-industrial development and countryside growth and progress, and relative thereto, shall:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(vii) <b>Adopt a comprehensive land use plan for the municipality: </b><i>Provided, </i>That the formulation, adoption, or modification of said plan shall be in coordination with the approved provincial comprehensive land use plan;<br><br>(viii) <b>Reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the municipality subject to the pertinent provision of this Code;</b><br><br>(ix) <b>Enact integrated zoning ordinances in consonance with the approved comprehensive land use plan, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations; </b>establish fire limits or zones, particularly in populous centers; and regulate the construction, repair or modification of buildings within said fire limits or zones in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Code[.] (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Likewise, the municipal council has the authority to reclassify agricultural lands. Section 20 of the Local Government Code of 1991, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 20. <i>Reclassification of Lands. </i>- (a) <b>A city or municipality may, through an ordinance passed by the sanggunian after conducting public hearing for the purpose, authorize the reclassification of agricultural lands and provide for the manner of their utilization or disposition in the following cases: (1) when the land ceases to be economically feasible and sound for agricultural purposes as determined by the Department of Agriculture or (2) where the land shall have substantially greater economic value for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes, as determined by the sanggunian concerned: </b><i><b>Provided, </b></i><b>That such reclassification shall be limited to the following percentage of the total agricultural land area at the time of the passage of the ordinance:</b><br><br><blockquote>(1) For highly urbanized and independent component cities, fifteen percent (15%);<br><br>(2) For component cities and first to the third class municipalities, ten percent (10%); and<br><br>(3) For fourth to sixth class municipalities, five percent (5%): <i>Provided, farther, </i>That agricultural lands distributed to agrarian reform beneficiaries pursuant to Republic Act Numbered Sixty-six hundred fifty-seven (R.A.

These "ratification" and "recognition" are in turn, speciously predicated upon a MARO certification that there is no agricultural tenancy over the properties and upon the NHA-issued certificate of registration and license to sell which, as established, covered a different property.<br><br>Also, <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Resolution No. 2006-004 was passed only in 2006. Obviously, the land use plan or the zoning ordinance contemplated under DAR A.O. No. 04, series of 2003, must be in existence prior to June 15, 1988, and not one which was passed on or after the effectivity of the CARL. Notably, as well, the Resolution seems to refer to a purported land use plan and zoning ordinance already adopted by the Province and the Municipality. The existence of such land use plan and zoning ordinance is, however, directly contravened by the MPDC letter dated September 6, 2006, certifying that there is no record as to the classification of the properties prior to June 15, 1988, and that the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance was approved by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>and the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan </i>only in 2002.<br><br>While petitioners also seem to rely on the land use plan and zoning ordinance approved in 2002, they fail to present such ordinance for the Court's appreciation. In any case, the Court assumes that such zoning ordinance could not help petitioners' cause in view of the uncontroverted MPDC's certification that the properties were classified as agricultural under the adopted land use plan and zoning ordinance.<br><br><i>The HLURB Certifications</i><br><br>In similar vein, the HLURB Certifications dated September 12, 2005, and March 22, 2006, are not proof that the properties were classified as residential prior to June 15, 1988.<br><br>The HLURB Certification dated September 12, 2005, provides:<br><br><blockquote>This is to certify that CELIA SUBDIVISION, subdivision project covered by LRC Plan Pcs-3160 located at San Mariano, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija has been issued a CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION (CR No.) RS-0272 and LICENSE TO SELL (LS No.) 0239 by the [NHA] on 28 April 1977 which is covered [sic] Transfer Certificate of Title No. 47474 (now NT-216355)[,] NT-47473 and NT-47472 with an area of 92.1943 hectares more or less, 13.3457 hectares more or less and 9.1630 hectares more or less respectively.<br><br>Furthermore, said CR and LS issued by the NHA is still valid and recognized by this Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In similar tenor, the HLURB Certification dated March 22, 2006, provides:<br><br><blockquote>This is to certify that CELIA SUBDIVISION, a subdivision project with Certificate of Registration (CR No.) RS-0272 and License to Sell (LS No.) 0239 by the [NHA] on 28 April 1977 under Title Nos. 47472, 47473 and NT-216355 which is covered by LRC Plan Pcs-3160 (Lot 3340, 3346, 1222, 3343, 3344 and lot 1-I of the subdivision plan Psd-03-042455, being a portion of Lot 1 II 3960 LRC Rec. No. (situated at Brgy. San Mariano, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija, containing an area of 1,547,030 square meters registered in the name of Elfleda Marcelo et.al.) is found to be within the URBAN RESIDENCE and partakes the nature of EXEMPTION pursuant to Sec. 3, par. c of [R.A. No. 6657] and [DOJ Opinion No. 044], that the subject properties had been classified and converted into subdivision for residential purpose by the NHA prior to June 15, 1988, the effectivity of [R.A. No. 6657] and further ratified and approved by the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Resolution No. 2006-004.<br><br>Furthermore, said Certificate of Rgistration [sic] and License to Sell issued by the NHA is valid and recognized by the Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To emphasize, what is required under DAR A.O. No. 4, series of 2003, is an HLURB approval of the town plan and zoning ordinance embodying the land classification, which approval must have been made prior to June 15, 1988. Here, both HLURB certifications merely confirm the existence of a certificate of registration and license to sell issued by the NHA which, as aforesaid, cover an entirely different set of properties.<br><br><i>Other Documentary Evidence</i><br><br>It bears mentioning that the OP also relied on the DARAB decision which ordered the cancellation of the CLOAs issued to the farmer-beneficiaries on the finding that the properties are residential. Notably, this finding was based on the 2004 tax declaration receipts and the registration certificate and license to sell issued by the NHA. Reliance upon this finding is misplaced. For one, the NHA issuances, as explained, have no bearing to the subject properties. For another, it is settled that a tax declaration is not conclusive of the nature of the property for zoning purposes as it is the classification made by the local government that prevails.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Also, the cancellation of the CLOAs was ordered not only because the subject properties were found to be residential but also because the CLOAs were improvidently issued. As to whether these findings are correct for justifying the cancellation of the CLOAs is another matter which the Court does not presently delve upon.<br><br>Petitioners also rely upon the Certification dated April 10, 2006, issued by the MPDC stating that the properties are residential. This certification, is however, predicated upon <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Resolution No. 2006-004 which, as established, is not a zoning ordinance or a comprehensive land use plan.<br><br>Finally, the Affidavit dated August 5, 2006 of a retired MPDC could not have worked to petitioners' advantage as it merely states that the properties were included in the proposed issuance of a certificate of eligibility for conversion. In any case, it is not within the power of a local government unit to convert agricultural lands to non-agricultural uses; its power is to reclassify lands into uses within their jurisdiction subject to certain limitations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Indubitably, petitioners fail to discharge the burden of proving that the properties were classified in the zoning ordinance and land use plan as residential, and that such zoning ordinance and land use plan were approved by the HLURB prior to June 15, 1988. At the very least, petitioners ought to have established that the subject properties were classified or reclassified as residential by any authorized government agency prior to June 15, 1988. But even this, petitioners fail to discharge. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that the subject properties remain to be agricultural and are therefore, not exempt from the coverage of the CARL.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is <b>DENIED. </b>The Decision dated June 28, 2012 and the Resolution dated February 4, 2013 of the Court of Appeals are <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>*</sup></font> (Chairperson), Caguioa, Lazaro-Javier,</i> and <i>Zalameda, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>* </sup></font>Acting Chief Justice per Special Order No. 2703 dated September 10, 2019.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup><span style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">**</span></sup> Also referred to as "Severiano" in the pleadings.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Dated March 6, 2013,<i> rollo, </i>pp. 9-30.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 31-48.
