IO2 [Ricky] Ramos relayed the information to the team leader, IO3 Sharon Bautista, who promptly coordinated with the Quick Reaction Force Team and with the Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Group (PAIDSOTG) of the Philippine National Police and thereafter, formed a team to conduct an anti-illegal drug operation. It was composed of IO2 Ricky Ramos who was designated as poseur-buyer, PO2 Armand Bautista as the immediate back-up, the confidential informant, and about six (6) members of the PNP Quick Reaction Force. They prepared the buy-bust money and the pre-arranged signal to indicate the done deal is for IO2 Ricky Ramos to remove his bull-cap.</p> <p> After the briefing, the confidential informant contacted accused-appellant to arrange the sale of<em> shabu</em> worth P1,000.00. IO2 Ramos and the confidential informant then proceeded to meet [the] accused-appellant at Purok 4, Sevilla, San Fernando City, La Union near a Shell gasoline station. Upon reaching the place, they found accused-appellant standing in front of his house and the informant introduced IO2 Ramos to accused-appellant as the buyer. After a brief conversation, the confidential informant told accused-appellant in Ilocano dialect. "<i>daytoy diay mangala ti sangaribo</i>" (he is the one who will get one thousand). Accused-appellant asked for the money and simultaneously took out two (2) pieces of small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets from his pocket and handed them to IO2 Ramos. At this point[,] IO2 Ramos executed the pre-arranged signal and the rest of the team rushed to the scene. As IO2 Ramos informed accused-appellant that he was a police officer, accused-appellant suddenly ran towards his house. The policemen chased accused-appellant who jumped into a canal, and he was eventually arrested. Accused-appellant was allowed to wash up and change clothing, and thereafter, IO2 Ramos marked the items and took pictures thereof. Accused-appellant and the drugs were brought to the police office where IO2 Ramos made an inventory and prepared a request for laboratory examination. He personally submitted the request and the subject plastic sachets with white crystalline substance to the crime laboratory and they were received by Forensic Chemist Lei Yen Valdez. After examination, she issued Chemistry Resport No. PDEAROI-DDO10-0007 affirming that the subject substances were positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known as "<i>shabu</i>[.] "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Version of the Defense</i></p><p> On the other hand, the version of the defense, as summarized by the CA, is as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> On the other hand, accused-appellant [, who was the sole witness for the defense,] vehemently denied the charge against him. He contended that on 22 November 2010, at around 3:00 in the afternoon, he was cooking inside his house when members of the PDEA suddenly barged in looking for a certain Mike, a former boarder in his house. He told the police that Mike no longer lived there, but the police insisted that he was Mike. The police then grabbed, kicked[,] and punched him until he fell into a canal near the kitchen. Two of the team members poked a gun at him, handcuffed[,] and then brought to the water pump for bathing. After cleaning, he was brought back to the house where he saw a woman [take] out two (2) pentel-marked sachets and two (2) five hundred peso bills placed on the table. He was directed to point at the sachets as the police took photographs of him. Thereafter, he was brought to the PDEA office and detained in a cell. After two (2) hours, he was brought back to the office where he saw barangay officials signing some papers and soon thereafter, he was brought back to the cell.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the RTC</b> </p><p> In the assailed Decision dated November 27, 2012, the RTC held that the prosecution clearly established the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and that the police officers complied with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It further held that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, thus the integrity of the drugs seized from Nelson was preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Lastly, it ruled that the defense of denial interposed by Nelson is a weak defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing premises, the court finds accused NELSON FLORES y FONBUENA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of Sec. 5 of R.A. 9165 and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00). </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Aggrieved, Nelson appealed to the CA. </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the CA</b> </p><p> In the assailed Decision dated February 12, 2015, the CA affirmed Nelson's conviction.

The accused is accordingly acquitted. </p><p> In cases involving dangerous drugs, the confiscated drug constitutes the very <em>corpus delicti</em> of the offense<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is essential, therefore, that the identity and integrity of the seized drug be established with moral certainty<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubt on its identity, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drug is seized up to its presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> In this regard, Section 21, Article II of RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the applicable law at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, outlines the procedure which the police officers must strictly follow to preserve the integrity of the confiscated drugs and/or paraphernalia used as evidence. The provision requires that: (I) the seized items be inventoried and photographed <b><u>immediately after seizure or confiscation</u></b>; and (2) the physical inventory and photographing must be done <b><u>in the presence of (a) the accused or his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ)</u></b>, all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension. It is only when the same is not practicable that the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 allows the inventory and photographing to be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <b>In this connection, this also means that the three required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of the conduct of the inventory of the seized items which, again, must be immediately done at the place of seizure and confiscation — <u>a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity</u></b>. Verily, a buy-bust team normally has sufficient time to gather and bring with them the said witnesses.</p><p> The Court, however, has clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 does not <em>ipso facto</em> render the seizure and custody over the items void. However, this is with the caveat that the prosecution still needs to satisfactorily prove that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It has been repeatedly emphasized by the Court that the prosecution has the positive duty to explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Without any justifiable explanation, which must be proven as a fact,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> is unreliable, and the acquittal of the accused should follow on the ground that his guilt has not been shown beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The buy-bust team failed to comply with the mandatory requirements under Section 21.</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In the instant case, the buy-bust team failed to comply with the mandatory requirements under Section 21, which thus creates reasonable doubt as to the identity and integrity of the seized drugs from Nelson. </p><p> <i>First</i>, none of the three required witnesses was present during the arrest of the accused and the marking, photography, and inventory of the seized drugs. The barangay official and media representative only arrived at the police station to sign the Certificate of Inventory, which was already prepared beforehand by the police officers. Neither did the police officers offer any sufficient explanation as to the absence of the DOJ representative. The testimony of IO2 Ricky Ramos (IO2 Ramos) equivocally established that the three mandatory witnesses were "called­-in" only when the police and the accused were already at the police station.

They admittedly "called-in" the mandatory witnesses only after the buy­-bust operation had already been supposedly accomplished although it is obvious that they had no excuse to do so. It is worthy to note that IO2 Ramos has been an intelligence officer of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) since 2008; thus, he has already previously conducted several buy-bust operations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The buy-bust operation in this case happened in 2010. Verily, he and his team already knew the standard procedure in a buy-bust operation and the mandatory requirements under Section 21. Hence, they should have had the foresight to do all the necessary preparations for it.</p><p> All told, the prosecution failed to prove the<i> corpus delicti</i> of the offense of sale of illegal drugs due to the multiple unexplained breaches of procedure committed by the buy-bust team in the seizure, custody, and handling of the seized drug. In other words, the prosecution was not able to overcome the presumption of innocence of Nelson. </p><p> As a reminder, the Court exhorts the prosecutors to diligently discharge their onus to prove compliance with the provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended, and its IRR, which is fundamental in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the <em>corpus delicti</em>. <b>To the mind of the Court, the procedure outlined in Section 21 is straightforward and easy to comply with.</b> In the presentation of evidence to prove compliance therewith, the prosecutors are enjoined to recognize any deviation from the prescribed procedure and provide the explanation therefor as dictated by available evidence. Compliance with Section 21 being integral to every conviction, the appellate court, this Court included, is at liberty to review the records of the case to satisfy itself that the required proof has been adduced by the prosecution whether the accused has raised, before the trial or appellate court, any issue of non-compliance. If deviations are observed and no justifiable reasons are provided, the conviction must be overturned, and the innocence of the accused affirmed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
