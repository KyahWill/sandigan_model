				<BR><BR><div align="center"></div><div align="justify">Cultural hegemony often invites people to conform to its impositions on their identities. Yet, there are some who, despite pressures, courageously choose to be authentic to themselves. This case is about the assurance of genuine individual autonomy within our constitutional legal order. It is about the virtue of tolerance and the humane goal of non-discrimination. It is about diversity that encourages meaningful—often passionate—deliberation. Thus, it is about nothing less than the quality of our freedom. <p> This Court does not have a monopoly in assuring this freedom. With the most difficult political, moral, and cultural questions, the Constitution requires that we share with the political departments of government, especially with Congress, the quest for solutions which balance interests while maintaining fealty to fundamental freedoms.</p><p> Adjudication enables arguments between parties with respect to the existence and interpretation of fundamental freedoms. On the other hand, legislation ideally allows public democratic deliberation on the various ways to assure these fundamental rights. The process of legislation exposes the experiences of those who have been oppressed, ensuring that they are understood by those who stand with the majority. Often, public reason needs to be first shaped through the crucible of campaigns and advocacies within our political forums before it is sharpened for judicial fiat. </p><p> Judicial wisdom is, in large part, the art of discerning when courts choose not to exercise their perceived competencies. </p><p> In this case, this Court unanimously chooses the path of caution. </p><p> Those with sexual orientations other than the heteronormative, gender identities that are transgender or fluid, or gender expressions that are not the usual manifestations of the dominant and expected cultural binaries—the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other gender and sexual minorities (LGBTQI+) community—have suffered enough marginalization and discrimination within our society. We choose to be careful not to add to these burdens through the swift hand of judicial review. </p><p> Marriage, as conceived in our current laws, may hew to the dominant heteronormative model, but asserting by judicial fiat that it should—with all its privileges and burdens—apply to same-sex couples as well will require a precision in adjudication, which the circumstances in this case do not present. To do so assumes a blind unproven judicial faith that the shape of marriage in our current laws will be benign for same-sex couples. Progressive passion asserted recklessly may unintentionally impose more burdens rather than less. </p><p> The pleadings assert a broad right of same-sex couples to official legal recognition of their intimate choices. They certainly deserve legal recognition in some way. However, whether such recognition should come by way of the exact same bundle of rights granted to heterosexual couples in our present laws is a proposition that should invite more public discussion in the halls of Congress. </p><p> Given the factual context of this case, this Court declines, for now, to grant the broad relief prayed for in the Petition. </p><p> Furthermore, the exercise of this Court's power of judicial review is among the most elementary matters imparted to aspiring lawyers. One who brandishes himself a lawyer is rightly presumed to be well-acquainted with the bare rudiments of court procedure and decorum. To forget these rules and practices—or worse, to purport to know them, but really, only to exploit them by way of propaganda—and then, to jump headlong into the taxing endeavor of constitutional litigation is a contemptuous betrayal of the high standards of the legal profession. </p><p> Lawyers, especially those engaged in public interest litigation, should always be mindful that their acts and omissions before the courts do not only affect themselves. By thrusting themselves into the limelight to take up the cudgels on behalf of a minority class, public interest lawyers represent the hopes and aspirations of a greater mass of people, not always with the consent of all the members of that class. Their errors and mistakes, their negligence and lethargy have a ripple effect even on persons who have no opportunity to consent to the stratagems and tactics employed by ill-prepared and sophomoric counsels. </p><p> On May 18, 2015, Jesus Nicardo M. Falcis III (Falcis) filed <i>pro se</i> before this Court a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> His Petition sought to "declare Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code as unconstitutional and, as a consequence, nullify Articles 46(4)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 55(6)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Family Code."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> Falcis claims that a resort to Rule 65 was appropriate, citing<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Magallona v. Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Araullo v. Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and the separate opinion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of now-retired Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion (Associate Justice Brion) in <i>Araullo</i>. Again citing Associate Justice Brion's separate opinion, he claims that this Court should follow a "'fresh' approach to this Court's judicial power"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and find that his Petition pertains to a constitutional case attended by grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He also asserts that the mere passage of the Family Code, with its Articles 1 and 2, was a <i>prima facie</i> case of grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and that the issues he raised were of such transcendental importance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> as to warrant the setting aside of procedural niceties.</p><p> Falcis further argues that his Petition complied with the requisites of judicial review: (1) actual case or controversy; (2) standing; (3) was raised at the earliest opportunity; and (4) that the constitutional question is the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As to standing, he claims that his standing consisted in his personal stake in the outcome of the case, as he "is an open and self-identified homosexual"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> who alleges that the Family Code has a "normative impact"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> on the status of same-sex relationships in the country. He was also allegedly injured by the supposed "prohibition against the right to marry the same-sex[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which prevents his plans to settle down in the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> Falcis justifies the direct recourse to this Court by citing, in addition to the alleged transcendental importance of the issues he raised, the supposed lack of need for trial concerning any factual issues. He also insists that the constitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code were the very <i>lis mota</i> of his case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> According to Falcis, a facial challenge on Articles 1 and 2 is permitted as these two (2) provisions regulate fundamental rights such as "the right to due process and equal protection, right to decisional and marital privacy, and the right to found a family in accordance with religious convictions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> Falcis further claims that strict scrutiny should be the test used in appraising the constitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code, and that the compelling state interest involved is the protection of marriage pursuant to Article XV, Section 2 of the Constitution, not the protection of heterosexual relationships.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He argues that like opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples are equally capable of founding their own families and fulfilling essential marital obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He claims that contrary to <i>Chi Ming Tsoi v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> procreation is not an essential marital obligation. Because there is allegedly no necessity to limit marriage as only between a man and a woman, Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code are supposedly unconstitutional for depriving Falcis of his right to liberty without substantive due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> To support his allegation that strict scrutiny is the appropriate test, Falcis extensively referenced and quoted—devoting more than five (5) pages of his 29-page Petition—the separate concurring opinion of retired Chief Justice Reynato Puno (retired Chief Justice Puno) in <i>Ang Ladlad Party-list v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> However, he claims that retired Chief Justice Puno incorrectly concluded that the appropriate test is intermediate or heightened review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Nonetheless, he argues that even under the rational basis test, there is a violation of the equal protection clause since there is no substantial distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex couples.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Finally, Falcis claims that Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code deny the existence of "individuals belonging to religious denominations that believe in same-sex marriage"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and that they have a "right to found a family in accordance with their religious convictions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He claims that the religious weddings conducted by these denominations have been denied civil recognition "unlike the religious convictions of Catholics and Muslims."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> On June 30, 2015, this Court ordered the Civil Registrar General to comment on the Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> On June 22, 2015, Fernando P. Perito (Perito) filed <i>pro se</i> an Answer-in-Intervention<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> to the Petition. He claims that the Petition failed to comply with several requirements of Rule 65, including: (1) the annexing of a certified true copy of the judgment, order, or resolution subject of the case; (2) there being no act of any tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; and (3) that the Petition had to be filed within 60 days from notice of the assailed judgment, order, or resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Perito also claims that Falcis did not present any statistics or evidence showing discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and that Falcis did not show any specific injury, such as the denial of a marriage license or refusal of a solemnizing officer to officiate a same-sex marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> Perito further points out that Falcis is estopped from questioning the validity of the Family Code, it having been effective since 1987.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> He also extensively cites the Christian Bible as authority for defending Articles 1 and 2's limitation of marriage as between a man and a woman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p> This Answer-in-Intervention was treated by this Court as a motion to intervene with answer-in-intervention, which was granted in this Court's July 28, 2015 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This Court, in the same Resolution, further required Falcis to reply to the Answer-in-Intervention. </p><p> Falcis filed his Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> to the Answer-in-Intervention on September 21, 2015. He reiterates his claims concerning his compliance with procedural requirements. His Reply was noted in this Court's October 6, 2015 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> The Civil Registrar General, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed its Comment (Ad Cautelam)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> on March 29, 2016. It prays that this Court deny due course to or dismiss the Petition. It notes that the Petition was not in the nature of a class suit, but was instead personal only to Falcis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Because of this, it claims that Falcis failed to show injury-in-fact and an actual case or controversy, but was rather seeking an advisory opinion that this Court cannot issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> The Civil Registrar General also faults Falcis for not impleading Congress, as his Petition actually challenged the current legislative policy on same-sex marriage, and not any act committed by the Civil Registrar-General.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Finally, it claims that Falcis has not proven that the issues in this case are of such transcendental importance, there being no law or facts contained in his Petition to determine any principles concerning the constitutionality of same-sex marriage in the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> On April 7, 2016, LGBTS Christian Church, Inc. (LGBTS Church), Reverend Crescencio "Ceejay" Agbayani, Jr. (Reverend Agbayani), Marlon Felipe (Felipe), and Maria Arlyn "Sugar" Ibañez (Ibañez)—collectively, petitioners-intervenors—whose counsel was Falcis himself, filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene and Admit Attached Petition-in-Intervention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> They ask this Court to allow them to intervene in the proceedings, claiming that: (1) they offer further procedural and substantive arguments; (2) their rights will not be protected in a separate proceeding; and (3) they have an interest in the outcome of this case. They adopt by reference the arguments raised by Falcis in his Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, they filed their Petition-in-Intervention,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> which is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking the same reliefs as those in Falcis' Petition, namely: (1) the declaration of unconstitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code; and (2) the invalidation of Articles 46(4) and 55(6) of the Family Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> Similar to Falcis, petitioners-intervenors claim that a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is an appropriate remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> They aver that the requisites of judicial review are present. First, they have an actual case or controversy since petitioners-intervenors Reverend Agbayani, Felipe, and Ibanez were supposedly denied a marriage license on August 3, 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Second, they have legal standing. LGBTS Church claims third-party standing, even as it also claims that its own right to religious freedom was directly, not just indirectly violated. Petitioners-intervenors Reverend Agbayani, Felipe, and Ibañez claim standing on the basis of their supposed attempts to secure marriage licenses. This was despite LGBTS Church claiming that it has third-party standing because its own members, which included petitioners-intervernors Reverend Agbayani, Felipe, and Ibañez, were "unlikely"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> to file suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners-intervenors restate Falcis' claims that the issues were raised at the earliest opportunity, that the constitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code is the <i>lis mota</i> of the case, and that a direct recourse to this Court was proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners-intervenors use arguments from Christian theology to prove that there should be no civil restriction against same-sex marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> They also claim that the lack of civil recognition for their religious ceremonies, as contrasted with the recognition granted to "Filipino Catholics and Filipino Muslims[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> violate the equal protection clause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> This Court noted the Motion to Intervene and Petition-in-Intervention in its June 7, 2016 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> On August 10, 2016, Falcis filed a Motion to Set the Case for Oral Arguments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> He also filed a Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> to the Comment (Ad Cautelam), again reiterating his procedural arguments.</p><p> In compliance with this Court's December 6, 2016 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General manifested<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> that it was maintaining the arguments stated in its Comment (Ad Cautelam), but reserved its right to comment on the Petition-in-Intervention. Its Manifestation was noted in this Court's February 7, 2017 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> On March 28, 2017, this Court granted the Motion for Leave to Intervene and Admit Petition-in-Intervention and required the Civil Registrar General and Perito to comment on the Petition-in-Intervention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p> The Civil Registrar General filed its Comment (Ad Cautelam) on the Petition-in-Intervention,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> which this Court noted in its August 8, 2017 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The Civil Registrar General claims that the issues raised in the Petition are political questions, saying that marriage's legal definition is a policy issue for Congress to determine,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and that any amendment to the definition in Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code should be addressed to Congress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p><p> In a March 6, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> this Court set the case for oral arguments, with a scheduled preliminary conference on June 5, 2018.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Perito manifested that he would not be able to attend the preliminary conference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> During the preliminary conference, Falcis, who appeared on his own behalf and on behalf of petitioners-intervenors, was ordered to show cause why he should not be cited in direct contempt: </p><blockquote> <p> Considering that petitioner Jesus Nicardo M. Falcis III was attired with a casual jacket, cropped jeans and loafers without socks, Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen directed him to show cause by June 6, 2018, why he should not be cited in direct contempt for his failure to observe the required decorum during the preliminary conference which is a formal session of the Court. Petitioner was likewise advised to request a briefing from his former professors, or the law firm he is going to retain, on the proper protocols to be observed inside the Court, to facilitate an orderly and smooth proceeding during the oral argument.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On June 6, 2018, Falcis filed his Compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> with the show-cause order. In a July 3, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> this Court found Falcis guilty of direct contempt of court: </p><blockquote> <p> Atty. Falcis acted in a contumacious manner during the June 5, 2018 preliminary conference. </p> <p> Atty. Falcis is not an uninformed layperson. He has been a member of the Philippine Bar for a number of years. As an officer of the court, he is duty bound to maintain towards this Court a respectful attitude essential to the proper administration of justice. He is charged with knowledge of the proper manner by which lawyers are to conduct themselves during judicial proceedings. His Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility exhort him to maintain the requisite decency and to afford dignity to this Court. </p> <p> Lawyers must serve their clients with competence and diligence. Under Rule 18.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, "[a] lawyer shall not handle any legal matter without adequate preparation." Atty. Falcis' appearance and behavior during the preliminary conference reveal the inadequacy of his preparation. Considering that the Advisory for Oral Arguments was served on the parties three (3) months prior to the preliminary conference, it was inexcusably careless for any of them to appear before this Court so barely prepared. </p> <p> The preliminary conference was not mere make-work. Rather, it was essential to the orderly conduct of proceedings and, ultimately, to the judicious disposition of this case. Appearance in it by counsels and parties should not be taken lightly. </p> <p> Atty. Falcis jeopardized the cause of his clients. Without even uttering a word, he recklessly courted disfavor with this Court. His bearing and demeanor were a disservice to his clients and to the human rights advocacy he purports to represent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Falcis was admonished to properly conduct himself in court and to be more circumspect of the duties attendant to his being a lawyer. He was sternly warned that any further contemptuous acts shall be dealt with more severely.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> On June 8, 2018, Ronaldo T. Reyes, Jeremy I. Gatdula, Cristina A. Montes, and Rufino Policarpio III (intervenors-oppositors) filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene and to Admit the Opposition-in-Intervention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> They claim that they have a legal interest in this case since the grant of the Petition would run counter to their religious beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p><p> In their Opposition-in-Intervention,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> they claim that this Court has no jurisdiction to act upon the Petition, none of the requisites of justiciability having been met. They further assert that they have standing to intervene in these proceedings as the proposed definition of marriage in the Petition is contrary to their religious beliefs and religious freedom as guaranteed in Article III, Sections 4 and 5 of the Constitution. They claim to be concerned taxpayers who seek to uphold the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> </p><p> Intervenors-oppositors argue that granting the Petition would be tantamount to judicial legislation, thus violating the doctrine of separation of powers. They claim that the definition of marriage in the Family Code was a valid exercise of legislative prerogative which this Court must uphold.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Further, there is no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Civil Registrar General, as there was no violation of the equal protection clause or of Falcis' right to liberty. They claim that there are substantial differences between opposite-sex and same-sex unions that account for state recognition only of the former, and that such limitation is for the common good.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> For them, children's welfare is a compelling state interest justifying intrusion into certain liberties, including the non-recognition of same-sex marriage. They assert that there was no violation of the right to privacy since Falcis and petitioners-intervenors "are not prohibited from publicly identifying as homosexuals or from entering into same-sex relationships[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></p><p> On June 13, 2018, Atty. Aldrich Fitz U. Dy (Atty. Dy), Atty. Keisha Trina M. Guangko (Atty. Guangko), Atty. Darwin P. Angeles (Atty. Angeles), and Atty. Alfredo B. Molo III (Atty. Molo) entered their appearance as co-counsels for Falcis and petitioners-intervenors .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> </p><p> The Civil Registrar General filed its Supplemental Comment with Leave of Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> on June 14, 2018. Addressing the substantive issues of the Petition, it claims that since the Constitution only contemplates opposite-sex marriage in Article XV, Section 2 and other related provisions, Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code are constitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><p> Oral arguments were conducted on June 19, 2018<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> and June 26, 2018.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> On June 26, 2018, this Court ordered the parties to submit their respective memoranda within 30 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><p> On July 25, 2018, both the Civil Registrar General<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and intervenors-oppositors<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> filed their respective Memoranda, which were noted in this Court's July 31, 2018 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> </p><p> On July 26, 2018, rather than file their memoranda, Falcis and petitioners-intervenors, through counsels Atty. Angeles, Atty. Guangko, and Atty. Christoper Ryan R. Maranan (Atty. Maranan) of Molo Sia Dy Tuazon Ty and Coloma Law Offices, filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Memorandum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Without this Court's prior favorable action on their Motion for Extension, they filed their Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> on August 3, 2018. </p><p> In its August 7, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> this Court denied the Motion for Extension and dispensed with Falcis' and petitioners-intervenors' Memorandum. The Resolution read, in part: </p><blockquote> <p> [W]ith the exception of Intervenor-Oppositor Atty. Fernando P.

It states: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2. Marriage, as an inviolable social institution, is the foundation of the family and shall be protected by the State. </p> </blockquote> <p> Lacking a manifestly restrictive textual definition of marriage, the Constitution is capable of accommodating a contemporaneous understanding of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC). The plain text and meaning of our constitutional provisions do not prohibit SOGIESC. These constitutional provisions in particular, and the Constitution in general, should be read through the lens of "a holistic approach in legal interpretation"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>: </p><blockquote> <p> The more appropriate and more effective approach is, thus, holistic rather than parochial: to consider context and the interplay of the historical, the contemporary, and even the envisioned.

Rather than kinship, marriage became the center of family life and was increasingly based on a formal contractual relationship between men, women, and their kinship groups. </i>The property and gender implications of marriage are evident in the exchange of gifts between spouses and families and clearly defined rules about the rights and responsibilities of each marital partner. During the Middle Ages, economic factors influenced marital choices more than affection, even among the poor, and women's sexuality was treated as a form of property (Coltrane and Adams 2008:54). Wealth and power inequalities meant that marriages among the elite and/or governing classes were based largely on creating political alliances and producing male children (Coontz 2005). <i>Ensuring paternity became important in the transfer of property to legitimate heirs, and the rights and sexuality of women were circumscribed</i>. Ideologies of male domination prevailed, and women, especially those who were married to powerful men, were typically treated like chattel and given very few rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Consequently, this has placed great significance on procreation as a purpose or end of the family. </p><p> Then, in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, women and children were seen as capable of operating factory machinery and, thus, entered the factory labor system to meet the surge in the demand for workers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> This "potential for economic independence altered families by making children less reliant on families for their survival and women freer from male domination."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></p><p> Eventually, the economic transition that came with the spread of industrialization resulted in massive social, geographical, and familial changes: </p><blockquote> <p> Industrialization shifted populations from rural to urban areas in search of work; for example, in 1830 most Americans still lived in rural areas and were employed in farming, but by 1930, most lived in towns and cities and were engaged in non-farming occupations. Urbanization, immigration, and adjustment to the industrial labor market took a toll on the stability of families. Industrial production undermined the family-based economy, food production technologies reduced the need for farmers, and essentials once produced by families were now produced in massive quantities in factories. New professional institutions emerged (e.g., public schools, hospitals) and assumed responsibility for many of the functions once fulfilled by families, ultimately making people less dependent on the family and leading some social scientists to predict its demise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This reorganization of work in the industrial economy "disrupted the gender order of many families by pulling women into the paid labor force and spawning new visions of gender equality."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> As a consequence, marriage based on free choice, romantic love, and companionship developed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> </p><p> Eventually, the modern family was seen primarily as: </p><blockquote> <p> . . . a nuclear, marriage-based entity in which men provided economically for their families and women performed housework and took care of children. . . . Socially defined notions of masculinity and femininity reflected these gendered family roles; for example, men were characterized as being naturally aggressive and rational—traits valuable in the competitive area of work—and women as being essentially submissive, domestic, and nurturing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The evolution of the social concept of family reveals that heteronormativity in marriage is not a static anthropological fact. The perceived complementarity of the sexes is problematized by the changing roles undertaken by men and women, especially under the present economic conditions. </p><p> To continue to ground the family as a social institution on the concept of the complementarity of the sexes is to perpetuate the discrimination faced by couples, whether opposite-sex or same-sex, who do not fit into that mold. It renders invisible the lived realities of families headed by single parents, families formed by sterile couples, families formed by couples who preferred not to have children, among many other family organizations. Furthermore, it reinforces certain gender stereotypes within the family. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> In a proper case, a good opportunity may arise for this Court to review the scope of Congress' power to statutorily define the scope in which constitutional provisions are effected. This is not that case. The Petition before this Court does not present an actual case over which we may properly exercise our power of judicial review. </p><p> There must be narrowly-framed constitutional issues based on a justiciable controversy: </p><blockquote> <p> Contemporaneous construction and aids that are external to the text may be resorted to when the text is capable of multiple, viable meanings. It is only then that one can go beyond the strict boundaries of the document. Nevertheless, even when meaning has already been ascertained from a reading of the plain text, contemporaneous construction may serve to verify or validate the meaning yielded by such reading. </p> <p> Limited resort to contemporaneous construction is justified by the realization that the business of understanding the Constitution is not exclusive to this Court. The basic democratic foundation of our constitutional order necessarily means that all organs of government, and even the People, read the fundamental law and are guided by it. When competing viable interpretations arise, a justiciable controversy may ensue requiring judicial intervention in order to arrive with finality at which interpretation shall be sustained. To remain true to its democratic moorings, however, judicial involvement must remain guided by a framework or deference and constitutional avoidance. This same principle underlies the basic doctrine that courts are to refrain from issuing advisory opinions. Specifically as regards this Court, only constitutional issues that are narrowly framed, sufficient to resolve an actual case, may be entertained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Founded on the principle of supremacy of law, judicial review is the courts' power to decide on the constitutionality of exercises of power by the other branches of government and to enforce constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> </p><p> Judicial review is inherent in this Court's judicial power. Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution states: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law. </p> <p> Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. </p> </blockquote> <p> Article VIII, Section 1 expands the territory of justiciable questions and narrows the off-limits area of political questions. In <i>Estrada v. Desierto</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> To be sure, courts here and abroad, have tried to lift the shroud on political question but its exact latitude still splits the best of legal minds. Developed by the courts in the 20th century, the political question doctrine which rests on the principle of separation of powers and on prudential considerations, continue to be refined in the mills of constitutional law. In the United States, the most authoritative guidelines to determine whether a question is political were spelled out by Mr. Justice Brennan in the 1962 case of <i>Baker v. Carr</i>, <i>viz</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> ". . . Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it, or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on question. Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for non justiciability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of political questions', not of political cases'." </p> </blockquote> <p> In the Philippine setting, this Court has been continuously confronted with cases calling for a firmer delineation of the inner and outer perimeters of a political question. Our leading case is <i>Tañada v. Cuenco</i>, where this Court, through former Chief Justice Roberto Concepcion, held that political questions refer "to those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be<i> decided by the people</i> in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which <i>full discretionary authority</i> has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of the government. It is concerned with issues dependent upon the <i>wisdom</i>, not <i>legality</i> of a particular measure." To a great degree, the 1987 Constitution has narrowed the reach of the political question doctrine when it expanded the power of judicial review of this court not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable <i>but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government.</i> Heretofore, the judiciary has focused on the "thou shalt not's" of the Constitution directed against the exercise of its jurisdiction. With the new provision, however, courts are given a greater prerogative to determine what it can do to prevent grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government.<i> Clearly, the new provision did not just grant the Court power of doing nothing</i>. In sync and symmetry with this intent are other provisions of the 1987 Constitution trimming the so called political thicket. Prominent of these provisions is section 18 of Article VII which empowers this Court in limpid language to ". . . review, in an appropriate proceeding filed by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ (of <i>habeas corpus</i>) or the extension thereof. . . ."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Nonetheless, the expansion of this Court's judicial power is by no means an abandonment of the need to satisfy the basic requisites of justiciability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> In <i>Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v.

While this Court has withheld the application of facial challenges to strictly penal statutes, it has <b>expanded</b> its scope to cover statutes not only regulating <b>free speech</b>, but also those involving <b>religious freedom</b>, and <b>other fundamental rights</b>. The underlying reason for this modification is simple. For unlike its counterpart in the U.S., this Court, under its expanded jurisdiction, is mandated by the Fundamental Law not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also <b><u>to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion</u> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government</b>.

Embedded in the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a law may be applied will not be heard to challenge a law on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, <i>i.e.,</i> in other situations not before the Court. A writer and scholar in Constitutional Law explains further: </p> <blockquote> <p> The most distinctive feature of the overbreadth technique is that it marks an exception to some of the usual rules of constitutional litigation. Ordinarily, a particular litigant claims that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to him or her; if the litigant prevails, the courts carve away the unconstitutional aspects of the law by invalidating its improper applications on a case to case basis. Moreover, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests. In overbreadth analysis, those rules give way; challenges are permitted to raise the rights of third parties; and the court invalidates the entire statute "on its face," not merely "as applied for" so that the overbroad law becomes unenforceable until a properly authorized court construes it more narrowly. The factor that motivates courts to depart from the normal adjudicatory rules is the concern with the "chilling;" deterrent effect of the overbroad statute on third parties not courageous enough to bring suit. The Court assumes that an overbroad law's "very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression." An overbreadth ruling is designed to remove that deterrent effect on the speech of those third parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> However, in <i>Disini, Jr. v. Secretary of Justice</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> this Court distinguished those facial challenges that could be properly considered as presenting an actual case or controversy: </p><blockquote> <p> When a penal statute encroaches upon the freedom of speech, a facial challenge grounded on the void-for-vagueness doctrine is acceptable. The inapplicability of the doctrine must be carefully delineated. As Justice Antonio T. Carpio explained in his dissent in <i>Romualdez v. Commission on Elections</i>, "we must view these statements of the Court on the inapplicability of the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines to penal statutes as appropriate only insofar as these doctrines are used to mount 'facial' challenges to penal statutes not involving free speech." </p> <p> In an "as applied" challenge, the petitioner who claims a violation of his constitutional right can raise any constitutional ground - absence of due process, lack of fair notice, lack of ascertainable standards, overbreadth, or vagueness. Here, one can challenge the constitutionality of a statute only if he asserts a violation of his own rights. It prohibits one from assailing the constitutionality of the statute based solely on the violation of the rights of third persons not before the court. This rule is also known as the prohibition against third-party standing. </p> <p> But this rule admits of exceptions. A petitioner may for instance mount a "facial" challenge to the constitutionality of a statute even if he claims no violation of his own rights under the assailed statute where it involves free speech on grounds of overbreadth or vagueness of the statute. The rationale for this exception is to counter the "chilling effect" on protected speech that comes from statutes violating free speech. A person who does not know whether his speech constitutes a crime under an overbroad or vague law may simply restrain himself from speaking in order to avoid being charged of a crime. The overbroad or vague law thus chills him into silence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> To be entertained by this Court, a facial challenge requires a showing of curtailment of the right to freedom of expression, because its basis is that an overly broad statute may chill otherwise constitutional speech.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup></p><p> The imperative of justiciability was reiterated in <i>Philippine Constitution Association v. Philippine Government</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> In <i>Province of North Cotabato v. GRP</i> (MOA-AD case), . . . the Court explained the limits of the power of judicial review and the prerequisites for the judicial determination of a case.</p> <p> In [that] case, the Court rejected the argument of the Solicitor General that there was no justiciable controversy that was ripe for adjudication. . . . The Court ruled that "[w]hen an act of a branch of government is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to settle the dispute." Moreover, in the MOA-AD case, the Executive was about to sign the initialed MOA-AD with the MILF in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in the presence of representatives of foreign states. Only the prompt issuance by this Court of a temporary restraining order stopped the signing, averting the implications that such signing would have caused. </p> <p> In the present case, however, the Court agrees with the Solicitor General that there is no actual case or controversy requiring a full-blown resolution of the principal issue presented by petitioners. </p> <p> Unlike the unconstitutional MOA-AD, the CAB, including the FAB, mandates the enactment of the Bangsamoro Basic Law in order for such peace agreements to be implemented. In the MOA-AD case, there was nothing in the MOA-AD which required the passage of any statute to implement the provisions of the MOA-AD, which in essence would have resulted in dramatically dismembering the Philippines by placing the provinces and areas covered by the MOA-AD under the control and jurisdiction of a Bangsamoro Juridical Entity. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Further, under the MOA-AD, the Executive branch assumed the mandatory obligation to amend the Constitution to conform to the MOA-AD. The Executive branch guaranteed to the MILF that the Constitution would be drastically overhauled to conform to the MOA-AD. ... the Executive branch usurped the sole discretionary power of Congress to propose amendments to the Constitution as well as the exclusive power of the sovereign people to approve or disapprove such proposed amendments. . . . such <i>ultra vires</i> commitment by the Executive branch constituted grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. </p> <p>. . . .</p> <p> Even if there were today an existing bill on the Bangsamoro Basic Law, it would still not be subject to judicial review. The Court held in <i>Montesclaros v. COMELEC</i> that it has no power to declare a proposed bill constitutional or unconstitutional because that would be in the nature of rendering an advisory opinion on a proposed act of Congress. The power of judicial review cannot be exercised in <i>vacuo</i>. As the Court in <i>Montesclaros</i> noted, invoking Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution, there can be no justiciable controversy involving the constitutionality of a proposed bill. The power of judicial review comes into play only after the passage of a bill, and not before.

In order to preserve this balance, branches of government must afford due respect and deference for the duties and functions constitutionally delegated to the other.

This is in truth all that is involved in what is termed "judicial supremacy" which properly is the power of judicial review under the Constitution. <i>Even then, this power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very lis mota presented.

Three of these replicated in other independent samples whose measures related to identity and attraction rather than behavior. These SNPs may serve to generate new lines of enquiry. In particular, the finding that one of the replicated SNPs (rs28371400-15q21.3) is linked to male pattern balding and is nearby a gene (TCF12) relevant to sexual differentiation strengthens the idea that sex-hormone regulation may be involved in the development of same-sex sexual behavior. Also, that another replicated SNP (rs34730029-11q12.1) is strongly linked to several genes involved in olfaction raises intriguing questions. Although the underlying mechanism at this locus is unclear, a link between olfaction and reproductive function has previously been established.

We observed changes in prevalence of reported same-sex sexual behavior across time, raising questions about how genetic and sociocultural influences on sexual behavior might interact. We also observed partly different genetic influences on same-sex sexual behavior in females and males; this could reflect sex differences in hormonal influences on sexual behavior (for example, importance of testosterone versus estrogen) but could also relate to different sociocultural contexts of female and male same-sex behavior and different demographics of gay, lesbian, and bisexual groups.

Ford and Beach's study of diverse cultures and of animal behaviors, confirmed Kinsey's view that homosexuality was more common than psychiatry maintained and that it was found regularly in nature. In the late 1950s, Evelyn Hooker, a psychologist, published a study in which she compared psychological test results of 30 gay men with 30 heterosexual controls, none of whom were psychiatric patients.

For in 'homosexuality's' place, the DSM-II contained a new diagnosis: Sexual Orientation Disturbance (SOD). SOD regarded homosexuality as an illness if an individual with same-sex attractions found them distressing and wanted to change. The new diagnosis legitimized the practice of sexual conversion therapies (and presumably justified insurance reimbursement for those interventions as well), even if homosexuality <i>per se</i> was no longer considered an illness. The new diagnosis also allowed for the unlikely possibility that a person unhappy about a heterosexual orientation could seek treatment to become gay. </p> <p> SOD was later replaced in DSM-III by a new category called 'Ego Dystonic Homosexuality' (EDH). However, it was obvious to psychiatrists more than a decade later that the inclusion first of SOD, and later EDH, was the result of earlier political compromises and that neither diagnosis met the definition of a disorder in the new nosology. Otherwise, all kinds of identity disturbances could be considered psychiatric disorders. 'Should people of color unhappy about their race be considered mentally ill?' critics asked. What about short people unhappy about their height? Why not ego-dystonic masturbation? As a result, ego-dystonic homosexuality was removed from the next revision, DSM-III-R, in 1987.

An illustration of this would be the laws against same-sex relations in colonies of the British Empire during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The inclusion of Section 377, which refers to carnal intercourse between same-sex individuals, as an offense "against the order of nature" and "unnatural" is a clear indication that homosexuality is viewed as both a sin and a sickness (Carey, 2011; Kannabiran &amp; Singh, 2009). Although the said legislation did not explicitly mention male-to-male or female-to-female sexual relations as a crime, they are considered to be "against the order of nature" and punishable by law (Indian Penal Code, 1860). Among the countries that adopted this law were Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Fiji, Hong Kong, India, Kiribati, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Myanmar (Burma), Nauru, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Western Samoa in the Asia Pacific region; and Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe in the African region (Human Rights Watch, 2008).

Local men dressed up as—and acting like—women were called, among others, <em>bayoguin, bayok, agi-ngin, asog, bido</em>, and <em>binabae</em>. The Spanish thought them remarkable not only because they effectively transitioned from male to female, but also because as spiritual intermediaries or <em>babaylan</em>, they were revered figures of authority in their respective communities. It's important to remember that their taking on the customary clothes of women—as well as their engagement in feminine work—was of a piece with a bigger and more basic transformation, one that redefined their gender almost completely as female. <b><i>More than mere cross-dressers, these "men" were gender-crossers, for they didn't merely assume the form and behavior of women.

More than these, men were banned from having sexual relations with fellow men for this ran contrary to the dominant religion anointed by the Spanish. The church had a corresponding punishment for the natives who violated this rule.

This Court, however, cannot recognize Ang Ladlad Party-List's allegations, since they were made by a different party, in a different case, on a different set of facts, for a different subject matter, concerning a different law, to a different governmental body. These are not "actual facts" sufficient to engender a justiciable controversy here.

You are saying or claiming that the proper reading of <em>Republic vs. Manalo</em> under the<em> ponen[c]ia</em> of Justice Peralta is that there is an alternative consequence to a finding that a provision is unconstitutional. Normally, if a provision is unconstitutional, it is void <em>ab initio</em>. And you are now saying that the Court has created new jurisprudence in <em>Republic vs. Manalo</em> that when we find a provision to be unconstitutional that it can be valid? </p> <p> ATTY.

FALCIS: <br> No, Your Honors, we are only asking for a statutory interpretation that was applied in <em>Republic vs. Manalo</em> that two interpretations that would lead to finding (<em>sic</em>) of unconstitutionality the Court adopted a liberal interpretation, did not declare Article 26 paragraph 2 as unconstitutional.

Law stands at its very core. <i>Due to this inherent "legalness" of marriage, the constitutional right to marry cannot be secured simply by removing legal barriers to something that exists outside of the law.

Not all intimate relationships are the same and, therefore, fit into the rights and duties afforded by our laws to marital relationships.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[401]</sup> </p><p> For this Court to instantly sanction same-sex marriage inevitably confines a class of persons to the rather restrictive nature of our current marriage laws. The most injurious thing we can do at this point is to constrain the relationships of those persons who did not even take part or join in this Petition to what our laws may forbiddingly define as the norm. Ironically, to do so would engender the opposite of loving freely, which petitioner himself consistently raised: </p><blockquote> <p> The worst thing we do in a human relationship is to regard the commitment of the other formulaic. That is, that it is shaped alone by legal duty or what those who are dominant in government regard as romantic. <i>In truth, each commitment is unique, borne of its own personal history, ennobled by the sacrifices it has gone through, and defined by the intimacy which only the autonomy of the parties creates.</i> </p> <p> In other words, words that describe when we love or are loved will always be different for each couple. It is that which we should understand:<i> intimacies that form the core of our beings should be as free as possible, bound not by social expectations but by the care and love each person can bring</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[402]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Allowing same-sex marriage based on this Petition alone can delay other more inclusive and egalitarian arrangements that the State can acknowledge. Many identities comprise the LGBTQI+ community. Prematurely adjudicating issues in a judicial forum despite a bare absence of facts is presumptuous. It may unwittingly diminish the LGBTQI+ community's capacity to create a strong movement that ensures lasting recognition, as well as public understanding, of SOGIESC. </p><p align="center"> <b>IX</b> </p><p> Petitioner has no legal standing to file his Petition.</p><p> Legal standing is a party's "personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[403]</sup> Interest in the case "means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[404]</sup> </p><p> Much like the requirement of an actual case or controversy, legal standing ensures that a party is seeking a concrete outcome or relief that may be granted by courts: </p><blockquote> <p> Legal standing or <i>locus standi </i>is the "right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question." To possess legal standing, parties must show "a personal and substantial interest in the case such that [they have] sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged." The requirement of direct injury guarantees that the party who brings suit has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and, in effect, assures "that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions." </p> <p> The requirements of legal standing and the recently discussed actual case and controversy are both "built on the principle of separation of powers, sparing as it does unnecessary interference or invalidation by the judicial branch of the actions rendered by its co-equal branches of government." In addition, economic reasons justify the rule. Thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> A lesser but not insignificant reason for screening the standing of persons who desire to litigate constitutional issues is economic in character. Given the sparseness of our resources, the capacity of courts to render efficient judicial service to our people is severely limited. For courts to indiscriminately open their doors to all types of suits and suitors is for them to unduly overburden their dockets, and ultimately render themselves ineffective dispensers of justice. To be sure, this is an evil that clearly confronts our judiciary today. </p> </blockquote> <p> Standing in private suits requires that actions be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest, interest being "material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree or judgment of the case[,] [not just] mere curiosity about the question involved." Whether a suit is public or private, the parties must have "a present substantial interest," not a "mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest." Those who bring the suit must possess their own right to the relief sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[405]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Even for exceptional suits filed by taxpayers, legislators, or concerned citizens, this Court has noted that the party must claim some kind of injury-in-fact.

His assertions of injury cannot, without sufficient proof, be directly linked to the imputed cause, the existence of the Family Code. His fixation on how the Family Code is the definitive cause of his inability to find a partner is plainly <i>non sequitur</i>. </p><p> Similarly, anticipation of harm is not equivalent to direct injury. Petitioner fails to show how the Family Code is the proximate cause of his alleged deprivations.

This Petition was filed only in 2015. Petitioner, as a member of the Philippine Bar, has been aware of the Family Code and its allegedly repugnant provisions, since at least his freshman year in law school. It is then extraordinary for him to claim, first, that he has been continually injured by the existence of the Family Code; and second, that he raised the unconstitutionality of Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code at the earliest possible opportunity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[420]</sup></p><p> Petitioner has neither suffered any direct personal injury nor shown that he is in danger of suffering any injury from the present implementation of the Family Code.

He only filed it after the Office of the Solicitor General had filed a Comment (Ad Cautelam) pointing out the procedural flaws in his original Petition. Still, the Petition-in-Intervention suffers from the same procedural infirmities as the original Petition. Likewise, it cannot cure the plethora of the original Petition's defects. Thus, it must also be dismissed. </p><p> Interventions are allowed under Rule 19, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 1. <i>Who may intervene.</i> — A person who has a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof may, with leave of court, be allowed to intervene in the action. The court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and whether or not the intervenor's rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding. </p> </blockquote> <p> Intervention is not an independent action but is ancillary and supplemental to existing litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[421]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>X(A) </b> </p><p> Intervention requires: (1) a movant's legal interest in the matter being litigated; (2) a showing that the intervention will not delay the proceedings; and (3) a claim by the intervenor that is incapable of being properly decided in a separate proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[422]</sup> Here, while petitioners-intervenors have legal interest in the issues, their claims are more adequately decided in a separate proceeding, seeking relief independently from the Petition. </p><p> The Petition-in-Intervention suffers from confusion as to its real purpose. A discerning reading of it reveals that the ultimate remedy to what petitioners-intervenors have averred is a directive that marriage licenses be issued to them. Yet, it does not actually ask for this: its prayer does not seek this, and it does not identify itself as a petition for mandamus (or an action for mandatory injunction). Rather, it couches itself as a petition of the same nature and seeking the same relief as the original Petition. It takes pains to make itself appear inextricable from the original Petition, at the expense of specifying what would make it viable. </p><p> It does not escape this Court's notice that the Petition and Petition-in-Intervention were prepared by the same counsel, Falcis, the petitioner himself. The Petition-in-Intervention impleaded the same single respondent, the Civil Registrar General, as the original Petition. It also merely "adopt[ed] by reference as their own all the arguments raised by Petitioner in his original Petition[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[423]</sup> Notably, a parenthetical argument made by petitioner that barely occupied two (2) pages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[424]</sup> of his Petition became the Petition-in-Intervention's entire subject: the right to found a family according to one's religious convictions. </p><p> Even though petitioners-intervenors Reverend Agbayani and Felipe, and Ibañez and her partner, all claim that they have "wish[ed] to be married legally and have applied for a marriage license but were denied[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[425]</sup> they only echoed the original Petition's prayer, merely seeking that Articles 1, 2, 46(4), and 55(6) of the Family Code be declared unconstitutional. Despite impleading respondent Civil Registrar General and asserting that they have a fundamental right to marry their partners, petitioners-intervenors never saw it proper—whether as the principal or a supplemental relief—to seek a writ of mandamus compelling respondent Civil Registrar General to issue marriage licenses to them. </p><p align="center"> <b>X(B)</b> </p><p> Given these, this Court can only arrive at the conclusion that the Petition-in-Intervention was a veiled vehicle by which petitioner sought to cure the glaring procedural defects of his original Petition. It was not a bona fide plea for relief, but a sly, tardy stratagem. It was not a genuine effort by an independent party to have its cause litigated in the same proceeding, but more of an ill-conceived attempt to prop up a thin and underdeveloped Petition. </p><p> Petitioner, as both party and counsel to petitioners-intervenors, miserably failed in his pretenses. A petition-in-intervention cannot create an actual case or controversy when the main petition has none. In <em>De Borja v. Pinalakas na Ugnayan ng Maliliit na Mangingisda ng Luzon, Mindanao at Visayas</em>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[426]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> We stress that neither the OSG's filing of its Comment nor the petition-in-intervention of PUMALU-MV, PKSK, and TDCI endowed De Borja's petition with an actual case or controversy. The Comment, for one, did not contest the allegations in De Borja's petition. Its main role was to supply De Borja's petition with the factual antecedents detailing how the alleged controversy reached the court. It also enlightened the RTC as to the two views, the mainland principle versus the archipelagic principle, on the definition of municipal waters. <em>Even if the Comment did oppose the petition, there would still be no justiciable controversy for lack of allegation that any person has ever contested or threatened to contest De Borja's claim of fishing rights. </em></p> <p> The petition-in-intervention, on the other hand, also did not dispute or oppose any of the allegations in De Borja's petition. While it did espouse the application of the archipelagic principle in contrast to the mainland principle advocated by the OSG, it must be recalled that De Borja did not advocate for any of these principles at that time. He only adopted the OSG's position in his Memorandum before the RTC. <em>Thus, the petition-in-intervention did not create an actual controversy in this case as the cause of action for declaratory relief must be made out by the allegations of the petition without the aid of any other pleading.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[427]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court cannot, and should not, sanction underhanded attempts by parties and counsels to unscrupulously abuse the rules on intervention so that they may cure the glaring defects and missteps in their legal strategies. </p><p align="center"> <b>X(C)</b> </p><p> Even if the Petition-in-Intervention is not a sham foisted by petitioner upon this Court, it still does not satisfy the requirements of justiciability. </p><p> Petitioners-intervenors invoke "third-party standing" as their basis for filing suit.

In <i>Powers v.

But there is no legally demandable right for a sect or denomination's religious ceremonies to be given State imprimatur. Likewise, and in a manner similar to petitioner, the Family Code has not been shown to be the proximate cause of petitioners-intervenors' alleged injury. </p><p> As to the requirement of some hindrance to a third party's ability to protect its own interests, petitioners-intervenors claim that "the relative silence in constitutional litigation of such special interest groups in our nation such as the American Civil Liberties Union in the United States may also be construed as a hindrance[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[430]</sup> This is a direct quotation from <i>White Light Corporation v.

It enables courts at each level to act in keeping with their peculiar competencies. This is so, even as this Court has original and concurrent jurisdiction with the regional trial courts and the Court of Appeals over petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus,<i> quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i>. In <i>Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[439]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The doctrine that requires respect for the hierarchy of courts was created by this court to ensure that every level of the judiciary performs its designated roles in an effective and efficient manner. Trial courts do not only determine the facts from the evaluation of the evidence presented before them. They are likewise competent to determine issues of law which may include the validity of an ordinance, statute, or even an executive issuance in relation to the Constitution. To effectively perform these functions, they are territorially organized into regions and then into branches. Their writs generally reach within those territorial boundaries. Necessarily, they mostly perform the all-important task of inferring the facts from the evidence as these are physically presented before them. In many instances, the facts occur within their territorial jurisdiction, which properly present the 'actual case' that makes ripe a determination of the constitutionality of such action. The consequences, of course, would be national in scope. There are, however, some cases where resort to courts at their level would not be practical considering their decisions could still be appealed before the higher courts, such as the Court of Appeals. </p> <p> The Court of Appeals is primarily designed as an appellate court that reviews the determination of facts and law made by the trial courts. It is collegiate in nature. This nature ensures more standpoints in the review of the actions of the trial court. But the Court of Appeals also has original jurisdiction over most special civil actions. Unlike the trial courts, its writs can have a nationwide scope. It is competent to determine facts and, ideally, should act on constitutional issues that may not necessarily be novel unless there are factual questions to determine. </p> <p> This court, on the other hand, leads the judiciary by breaking new ground or further reiterating — in the light of new circumstances or in the light of some confusions of bench or bar — existing precedents. Rather than a court of first instance or as a repetition of the actions of the Court of Appeals, this court promulgates these doctrinal devices in order that it truly performs that role.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[440]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Very recently, in <i>Gios-Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[441]</sup> this Court traced the jurisdictional history of the extraordinary writs of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, <i>quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i>. We noted that while the 1973 Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[442]</sup> conferred on this Court original jurisdiction to issue these extraordinary writs, the same power was later extended to the Court of Appeals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[443]</sup> and the regional trial courts<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[444]</sup> through Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, otherwise known as the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980. </p><p> This concurrence of jurisdiction persists under the 1987 Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[445]</sup> and the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[446]</sup> </p><p> Time and again, this Court has held that the concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and the regional trial courts with this Court does not give parties absolute discretion in immediately seeking recourse from the highest court of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[447]</sup> In <i>Gios-Samar</i>, we emphasized that the power to issue extraordinary writs was extended to lower courts not only as a means of procedural expediency, but also to fulfill a constitutional imperative as regards: (1) the structure of our judicial system; and (2) the requirements of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[448]</sup></p><p> Considering the structure of our judicial system, this Court explained in <i>Gios-Samar</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> In <i>Alonso v. Cebu Country Club, Inc.</i> (Alonso), this Court had occasion to articulate the role of the CA in the judicial hierarchy, viz.: </p> <blockquote> <p> The hierarchy of courts is not to be lightly regarded by litigants. The CA stands between the RTC and the Court, and its establishment has been precisely to take over much of the work that used to be done by the Court. Historically, the CA has been of the greatest help to the Court in synthesizing the facts, issues, and rulings in an orderly and intelligible manner and in identifying errors that ordinarily might escape detection. The Court has thus been freed to better discharge its constitutional duties and perform its most important work, which, in the words of Dean Vicente G. Sinco, "is less concerned with the decision of cases that begin and end with the transient rights and obligations of particular individuals but is more intertwined with the direction of national policies, momentous economic and social problems, the delimitation of governmental authority and its impact upon fundamental rights." . . . </p> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, when litigants seek relief directly from the Court, they bypass the judicial structure and open themselves to the risk of presenting incomplete or disputed facts. This consequently hampers the resolution of controversies before the Court. Without the necessary facts, the Court cannot authoritatively determine the rights and obligations of the parties. The case would then become another addition to the Court's already congested dockets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[449]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Enabling lower courts to grant extraordinary writs has contributed greatly to the practical concern of decongesting dockets. More important, it facilitates the need to enable factual issues to be fully ventilated in proceedings before courts that are better equipped at appreciating evidence, and ultimately bringing to this Court only issues of paramount and pervasive importance. As the final interpreter of the laws of the land, the cases brought before this Court should more appropriately be raising pure questions of law, with evidentiary matters having been authoritatively settled by lower courts. </p><p> If this Court were to burden itself with settling every factual nuance of every petition filed before it, the entire judicial machinery would bog down. Cases more deserving of this Court's sublime consideration would be waylaid. In <i>Gios-Samar</i>, this Court further explained: </p><blockquote> <p> The doctrine of hierarchy of courts operates to: (1) prevent inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction; (2) prevent further over-crowding of the Court's docket; and (3) prevent the inevitable and resultant delay, intended or otherwise, in the adjudication of cases which often have to be remanded or referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of procedure, or as the court better equipped to resolve factual questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[450]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Likewise, this Court discussed how the doctrine of hierarchy of courts serves the constitutional right of litigants to due process: </p><blockquote> <p> While the term "due process of law" evades exact and concrete definition, this Court, in one of its earliest decisions, referred to it as a law which hears before it condemns which proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial. It means that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property, and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society. Under the present Rules of Court, which governs our judicial proceedings, warring factual allegations of parties are settled through presentation of evidence. Evidence is the means of ascertaining, in a judicial proceeding, the truth respecting a matter of fact. As earlier demonstrated, the Court cannot accept evidence in the first instance. By directly filing a case before the Court, litigants necessarily deprive themselves of the op[p]ortunity to completely pursue or defend their causes of actions. Their right to due process is effectively undermined by their own doing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[451]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Immediately elevating evidentiary matters to this Court deprives the parties of the chance to properly substantiate their respective claims and defenses. It is essential for courts to justly resolve controversies. Parties who proceed headlong to this Court deny themselves their own chance at effective and exhaustive litigation. </p><p> Thus, this Court's dismissal of petitions that inextricably entail factual questions and violate the doctrine of hierarchy of courts does not merely arise out of a strict application of procedural technicalities. Rather, such dismissal is a necessary consequence of the greater interest of enabling effective litigation, in keeping with the right to due process. The parties' beseeching for relief inordinately inflates this Court's competence, but we find no consolation in flattery. In the end, it is never for this Court to arrogate unto itself a task that we are ill-equipped to perform: </p><blockquote> <p> In fine, while this Court has original and concurrent jurisdiction with the RTC and the CA in the issuance of writs of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, <em>quo warranto</em>, and <em>habeas corpus</em> (extraordinary writs), direct recourse to this Court is proper only to seek resolution of questions of law. Save for the single specific instance provided by the Constitution under Section 18, Article VII, cases the resolution of which depends on the determination of questions of fact cannot be brought directly before the Court because we are not a trier of facts. We are not equipped, either by structure or rule, to receive and evaluate evidence in the first instance; these are the primary functions of the lower courts or regulatory agencies. This is the <em>raison d'être</em> behind the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. It operates as a constitutional filtering mechanism designed to enable this Court to focus on the more fundamental tasks assigned to it by the Constitution. It is a bright-line rule which cannot be brushed aside by an invocation of the transcendental importance or constitutional dimension of the issue or cause raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[452]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>XII (B) </b></p><p> The distinction between questions of fact and questions of law is settled. A question of fact exists when doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the facts presented; a question of law exists when the issue arises as to what the law is, given a state of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[453]</sup> </p><p> That the issues involved are of transcendental importance is an oft-cited justification for failing to comply with the doctrine of hierarchy of courts and for bringing admittedly factual issues to this Court. </p><p> <em>Diocese of Bacolod</em> recognized transcendental importance as an exception to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. In cases of transcendental importance, imminent and clear threats to constitutional rights warrant a direct resort to this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[454]</sup> This was clarified in <i>Gios-Samar</i>. There, this Court emphasized that transcendental importance—originally cited to relax rules on legal standing and not as an exception to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts—applies only to cases with purely legal issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[455]</sup> We explained that the decisive factor in whether this Court should permit the invocation of transcendental importance is not merely the presence of "special and important reasons[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[456]</sup> but the nature of the question presented by the parties. This Court declared that there must be no disputed facts, and the issues raised should only be questions of law:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[457]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [W]hen a question before the Court involves determination of a factual issue indispensable to the resolution of the legal issue, the Court will refuse to resolve the question regardless of the allegation or invocation of compelling reasons, such as the transcendental or paramount importance of the case. Such question must first be brought before the proper trial courts or the CA, both of which are specially equipped to try and resolve factual questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[458]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Still, it does not follow that this Court should proceed to exercise its power of judicial review just because a case is attended with purely legal issues. Jurisdiction ought to be distinguished from justiciability. Jurisdiction pertains to competence "to hear, try[,] and decide a case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[459]</sup> On the other hand, </p><blockquote> <p> [d]etermining whether the case, or any of the issues raised, is justiciable is an exercise of the power granted to a court with jurisdiction over a case that involves constitutional adjudication. Thus, even if this Court has jurisdiction, the canons of constitutional adjudication in our jurisdiction allow us to disregard the questions raised at our discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[460]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Appraising justiciability is typified by constitutional avoidance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[461]</sup> This remains a matter of enabling this Court to act in keeping with its capabilities. Matters of policy are properly left to government organs that are better equipped at framing them. Justiciability demands that issues and judicial pronouncements be properly framed in relation to established facts: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i> imbues these rules with its libertarian character. Principally, Angara emphasized the liberal deference to another constitutional department or organ given the majoritarian and representative character of the political deliberations in their forums. It is not merely a judicial stance dictated by courtesy, but is rooted on the very nature of this Court. Unless congealed in constitutional or statutory text and imperatively called for by the actual and non-controversial facts of the case, this Court does not express policy. This Court should channel democratic deliberation where it should take place. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Judicial restraint is also founded on a policy of conscious and deliberate caution. This Court should refrain from speculating on the facts of a case and should allow parties to shape their case instead. Likewise, this Court should avoid projecting hypothetical situations where none of the parties can fully argue simply because they have not established the facts or are not interested in the issues raised by the hypothetical situations. In a way, courts are mandated to adopt an attitude of judicial skepticism. What we think may be happening may not at all be the case. Therefore, this Court should always await the proper case to be properly pleaded and proved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[462]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, concerning the extent to which transcendental importance carves exceptions to the requirements of justiciability, "[t]he elements supported by the facts of an actual case, and the imperatives of our role as the Supreme Court within a specific cultural or historic context, must be made clear":<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[463]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> They should be properly pleaded by the petitioner so that whether there is any transcendental importance to a case is made an issue.

Our rules on jurisdiction and our interpretation of what is justiciable, refined with relevant cases, may be enough.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[464]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Otherwise, this Court would cede unfettered prerogative on parties. It would enable the parties to impose their own determination of what issues are of paramount, national significance, warranting immediate attention by the highest court of the land. </p><p align="center"> <b>XII (C)</b> </p><p> In an attempt to divert this Court's attention from the glaring fundamental missteps of his Petition, petitioner—almost predictably—invokes transcendental importance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[465]</sup> This invocation fails to satisfy this Court of the need to resolve the Petition on the merits.

Jardeleza (Associate Justice Jardeleza)'s interpellation during oral arguments highlighted this. Citing as an example the experience of then attorney and later Justice Thurgood Marshall when he attacked the "separate but equal" approach to schools in the segregation era of the United States, Associate Justice Jardeleza emphasized the need for a contextualization of petitioners' arguments using factual and evidentiary bases: </p><blockquote> <p> JUSTICE JARDELEZA:<br> . . . Now, did Thurgood Marshall go direct to the US Supreme Court? </p> <p> ATTY. FALCIS: <br> No, Your Honor. </p> <p> JUSTICE JARDELEZA: <br> That is the point of Justice Bersamin.

You have your view, right? The government has a different view about the history and if I just listen to you, you will give me your views and if I just listen to the SOLGEN, he will give me his views.

Mr. Falcis, for example, adverted to <i>Brown v. Board of Education.</i> And it should interest you and it is a fascinating history on how a group of people spearheaded by the NAACP effected social change "separate but equal is not constitutional". . . . And remember, the question there was separate but equal schools for black children and white children, "Was it causing psychological harm to the black children?" Of course, the whites were saying "no" because it's equal, they have equal facilities. The famous psychologist that they presented there is named Kenneth Clark, who had his famous doll test, manika. He was able to prove that to the satisfaction of the trial court that indeed black children sometimes even think that, you know, when you present them with dolls, that they are white. That is the type of evidence I think that we need in this case. Now, very quickly and I will segue to Obergefell, again, five cases four different states. They presented the Chairman of the Department of History of Yale. We heard a lot, the government is talking of tradition and history. But again, for example, SolGen is citing Blair and Robertson, that, of course, qualifies as a Learned Treaties, right? But again, for the proposition that the history of this country is in favor of same sex, I would love first to hear, as an expert, probably the Chairman of History of Ateneo and UP. As in Obergefell, they also had the Department of Psychology, Head of Washington and Lee University. <i>So, my plea to both of you, especially to the petitioner, at this point in time, I am not willing to ask you in your memo to discuss the merits because unless the petitioner convinces me that we have a proper exception to the hierarchy of court rules then I think, for the first time, this Court should consider that, when we say there is a violation of the hierarchy of rules, we stop, we don't go to merits. And that's why I'm, I cannot go, for the life of me, to the merits if you have this question of fact in my mind. "Who, which couples can belter raise a child?"

After all, it was petitioner who set all of these events in motion; the other parties merely responded to what he sought. </p><p> Petitioner and his co-counsel's reference to the "impulsivity of youth"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[482]</sup> utterly fails to impress. If at all, this Court sees this as a deodorized admission of unreadiness and impotence. </p><p> In any case, as this Court has already stated in its July 3, 2018 Resolution: </p><blockquote> <p> Atty. Falcis is not an uninformed layperson. He has been a member of the Philippine Bar for a number of years. As an officer of the court, he is duty bound to maintain towards this Court a respectful attitude essential to the proper administration of justice. He is charged with knowledge of the proper manner by which lawyers are to conduct themselves during judicial proceedings. His Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility exhort him to maintain the requisite decency and to afford dignity to this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[483]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Youth and professional inexperience do not excuse the manifest inability of sworn court officers to follow lawful orders. Like petitioner, Atty. Angeles, Atty. Guangko and Atty. Maranan are members of the Philippine Bar, charged with basic knowledge of the rules of pleading and practice before the courts, especially this Court. They are not uninformed laypersons whose ignorance can be excused by inexperience. It bears noting that Atty. Angeles, Atty. Guangko, and Atty. Maranan are part of the law firm Molo Sia Dy Tuazon Ty and Coloma Law Offices and are, thus, presumably guided by more experienced litigators who should have been able to competently advise them on what is expected of those who appear before this Court. </p><p align="center"> <b>XIV</b></p><p> Diligence is even more important when the cause lawyers take upon themselves to defend involves assertions of fundamental rights. By voluntarily taking up this case, petitioner and his co-counsels gave their "unqualified commitment to advance and defend [it.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[484]</sup> The bare minimum of this commitment is to observe and comply with the deadlines set by a court. </p><p> Lawyers who wish to practice public interest litigation should be ever mindful that their acts and omissions before the courts do not only affect themselves. In truth, by thrusting themselves into the limelight to take up the cudgels on behalf of a minority class, they represent the hopes and aspirations of a greater mass of people, not always with the consent of all its members. Their errors and mistakes have a ripple effect even on persons who did not agree with or had no opportunity to consent to the stratagems and tactics they employed. </p><p> One who touts himself an advocate for the marginalized must know better than to hijack the cause of those whom he himself proclaims to be oppressed. Public interest lawyering demands more than the cursory invocation of legal doctrines, as though they were magical incantations swiftly disengaging obstacles at their mere utterance. Public interest advocacy is not about fabricating prestige. It is about the discomfort of taking the cudgels for the weak and the dangers of standing against the powerful. The test of how lawyers truly become worthy of esteem and approval is in how they are capable of buckling down in silence, anonymity, and utter modesty—doing the spartan work of research and study, of writing and self-correction. It is by their grit in these unassuming tasks, not by hollow, swift appeals to fame, that they are seasoned and, in due time, become luminaries, the standard by which all others are measured. </p><p> Petitioner courted disaster for the cause he chose to represent. He must have known what was at stake. Yet, he came to this Court scandalously unprepared, equipped with nothing more than empty braggadocio. For a shot at fame, he toyed with the hopes and tribulations of a marginalized class. </p><p> By failing to represent his cause with even the barest competence and diligence, petitioner betrayed the standards of legal practice. His failure to file the required memorandum on time is just the most recent manifestation of this betrayal. He disrespected not only his cause, but also this Court—an unequivocal act of indirect contempt. </p><p> A person adjudged guilty of indirect contempt may be punished by a fine not exceeding P30,000.00 or imprisonment not exceeding six (6) months, or both.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[485]</sup> To serve as a reminder to the bench and bar, and in light of petitioner's being earlier adjudged guilty of contempt of court for a similar offense—for which he was specifically warned that any further contemptuous acts shall be dealt with more severely—this Court, while declining to mete out the penalty of imprisonment by way of clemency, imposes on petitioner the penalty of a fine. </p><p> Similarly, parties who come before this Court to intervene in a proceeding should be prepared to fully participate in all its stages, whenever this Court requires them to. Records show that after oral arguments, intervenor-oppositor Perito also never filed a memorandum pursuant to the June 26, 2018 Order. He has not made any manifestation or explanation for his noncompliance. His failure to comply with this Court's order likewise constitutes indirect contempt. </p><p> What we do in the name of public interest should be the result of a collective decision that comes from well-thought-out strategies of the movement in whose name we bring a case before this Court. Otherwise, premature petitions filed by those who seek to see their names in our jurisprudential records may only do more harm than good. Good intentions are no substitute for deliberate, conscious, and responsible action. Litigation for the public interest of those who have been marginalized and oppressed deserves much more than the way that it has been handled in this case. </p><p align="center"> <b>A Final Note</b></p><p> Our freedom to choose the way we structure our intimate relationships with our chosen significant other in a large sense defines us as human beings. Even opposite-sex couples continually adjust the day-to-day terms of their partnership as their relationships mature. It is in the sanctuary of their spaces that we authentically evolve, become better human beings, and thus contribute meaningfully within our society. After all, the companionship and understanding that we inevitably discover with the person we choose to spend the rest of our lives with provide the foundation for an ethic of care that enriches a democracy. </p><p> This Court sympathizes with the petitioner with his obvious longing to find a partner. We understand the desire of same-sex couples to seek, not moral judgment based on discrimination from any of our laws, but rather, a balanced recognition of their true, authentic, and responsive choices. </p><p> Yet, the time for a definitive judicial fiat may not yet be here. This is not the case that presents the clearest actual factual backdrop to make the precise reasoned judgment our Constitution requires. Perhaps, even before that actual case arrives, our democratically-elected representatives in Congress will have seen the wisdom of acting with dispatch to address the suffering of many of those who choose to love distinctively, uniquely, but no less genuinely and passionately. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition and the Petition-in-Intervention are <b>DISMISSED</b>. </p><p> This Court finds petitioner Atty. Jesus Nicardo M. Falcis III, his co-counsels Atty. Darwin P. Angeles, Atty. Keisha Trina M. Guangko, Atty. Christopher Ryan R. Maranan, as well as intervenor-oppositor Atty. Fernando P. Perito, all <b>GUILTY</b> of <b>INDIRECT CONTEMPT OF COURT</b>. </p><p> Atty. Falcis is sentenced to pay a fine of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) within thirty (30) days from notice. Atty.

"Affirmed gender identity" refers to a person's gender identity after coming out as [transgender and gender non-conforming] or undergoing a social and/or medical transition process. </p> <p> <i>Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression, and Sex Characteristics at the Universal Periodic Review</i>, ARC INTERNATIONAL, THE INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANS AND INTERSEX ASSOCIATION 14 (2016), available at &lt; https://ilga.org/downloads/SOGIESC_at_UPR_report.pdf &gt; (last visited on September 2, 2019), provides: </p> <p> Gender expression: External manifestations of gender, expressed through one's name, pronouns, clothing, haircut, behavior, voice, or body characteristics. Society identifies these cues as masculine and feminine, although what is considered masculine and feminine changes over time and varies by culture. Typically, transgender people seek to make their gender expression align with their gender identity, rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. </p> </blockquote> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> CONST., art.

Also, the petitioner does not have any<em> locus standi</em>. And even if we were to touch on the merits, he has not made out a clear case for a declaration of the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the <em>Family Code</em> (Executive Order No. 209) relative to its definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman.</p> <p> At the outset, it is to be pointed out that the role of the Court in constitutional adjudication is to determine the rights of the people under the Constitution, an undertaking that demands, among others, the presence of an actual case or controversy ripe for judicial pronouncement, and that the case must be raised by one who has the personality or standing to do so. Here, the petitioner fails to satisfy both requisites. He is practically beseeching the Court to come up with an advisory opinion about the presence of constitutionally protected right to same-sex marriages - in effect seeking to "convert the Court into an Office of Ombudsman for the ventilation of generalized grievances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p><p>An actual case or controversy refers to an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory. The controversy needs to be definite and concrete, bearing upon the legal relations of parties who are pitted against each other due to their adverse legal interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Further, "[a]n aspect of the 'case-or-controversy' requirement is the requisite of 'ripeness.' In the United States, courts are centrally concerned with whether a case involves uncertain contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all. Another concern is the evaluation of the twofold aspect of ripeness: <em>first</em>, the fitness of the issues for judicial decision; and <em>second</em>, the hardship to the parties entailed by withholding court consideration. In our jurisdiction, the issue of ripeness is generally treated in terms of actual injury to the plaintiff. Hence, a question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><p> It has been held that "as to the element of injury, such aspect is not something that just anybody with some grievance or pain may assert. It has to be <strong>direct and substantial</strong> to make it worth the court's time, as well as the effort of inquiry into the constitutionality of the acts of another department of government. If the asserted injury is more imagined than real, or is<strong> merely superficial and insubstantial</strong>, then the courts may end up being importuned to decide a matter that does not really justify such an excursion into constitutional adjudication. The rationale for this constitutional requirement of <em>locus standi</em> is by no means trifle. Not only does it assure the vigorous adversary presentation of the case; more importantly, it must suffice to warrant the Judiciary's overruling the determination of a coordinate, democratically elected organ of government, such as the President, and the clear approval by Congress, in this case. Indeed, the rationale goes to the very essence of representative democracies."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> Intrinsically related to the presence of an actual case or controversy ripe for adjudication is the requirement that the issue be raised by the proper party, or the issue of <em>locus standi</em>. Even as this Court is the repository of the final word on what the law is, we should always be aware of the need for some restraint on the exercise of the power of judicial review. As then Associate Justice, later Chief Justice, Reynato S. Puno then intoned in one of his dissents: "Stated otherwise, courts are neither free to decide<em> all </em>kinds of cases dumped into their laps nor are they free to open their doors to<em> all </em>parties or entities claiming a grievance. The rationale for this constitutional requirement of<em> locus standi </em>is by no means trifle. It is intended 'to assure a vigorous adversary presentation of the case, and, perhaps more importantly to warrant the judiciary's overruling the determination of a coordinate, democratically elected organ of government.' It, thus, goes to the very essence of representative democracies."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Otherwise stated, "[a] party must show that he has been, or is about to be denied some personal right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled. A party must also show that he has a real interest in the suit. By 'real interest' is meant a present substantial interest, as distinguished from a mere expectancy or future, contingent, subordinate, or inconsequential interest."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> Relative to the foregoing matter is the need to give the legislature space to do its job of determining policies as an aspect of the democratic process. In this regard, then Associate Justice Santiago M. Kapunan noted: "The idea that a norm of constitutional adjudication could be lightly brushed aside on the mere supposition that an issue before the Court is of paramount public concern does great harm to a democratic system which espouses a delicate balance between three separate but co-equal branches of government. It is equally of paramount public concern, <em>certainly paramount to the survival of our democracy</em>, that acts of the other branches of government are accorded due respect by this Court. x x x. Notwithstanding Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution, since the exercise of the power of judicial review by this Court is inherently anti-democratic, this Court should exercise a becoming modesty in acting as a <em>revisor</em> of an act of the executive or legislative branch."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> Prudential considerations should caution the Court from having to accept and decide each and every case presented to it just because the questions raised may be interesting, novel or challenging. There is a time for coffee table discussions of exotic ideas, but the Court does not sit to do such a discourse. In undertaking judicial review, it decides in accordance with the Fundamental Law issues that have particular relevance and application to actual facts and circumstances, not imagined or anticipated situations. </p><p> Petitioner Falsis does not assert that he has been directly injured by the provisions of the <em>Family Code</em>. If ever he would be prevented from marrying, that is still in the uncertain future, a contingency that may never happen. However, he tries to rectify this problem by making reference to the petition-in-intervention filed by <em>LGBTS Christian Church, Inc., et al.</em> who allegedly were prevented from having a same-sex marriage ceremony when the same-sex couple was not granted a marriage license. In this connection, <em><strong>intervention</strong></em> should never be allowed to be utilized as a means to correct a fatal omission in the principal action. Intervention is only ancillary to the main case and it should not be conveniently resorted to as a means to save the day for an intrinsically flawed petition. </p><p> And even if we were to go to the merits, I would like to call attention to the fact that the laws and judicial decisions are reflective of the reality in society - a recognition of the values and norms that the people hold, recognize and cherish. Congress is the democratic institution which initially may tackle issues and policies about interpersonal relations and institutions affecting its citizens, including the propriety or desirability of same-sex marriage. It is not for the courts to jump into the fray on the pretext that it is merely reading for the people the rights and liberties under the Constitution. Only in the presence of a clear violation of the tenets of the Fundamental Law may the courts proceed to declare that an unmistakable constitutional right has been impaired or otherwise trampled upon by the government. In the absence of such, the courts should stay their hand. In this particular instance, I do not see any such violation that would justify the Court getting into this social and political debate on same-sex marriages. </p><p> In any case, what is not to be overlooked is the reality that judicial adjudication has to be rooted in the Constitution and the laws which are expressions or manifestations of what society and the people aspire for, and the courts must necessarily get their bearings from them. Decisions cannot be oblivious to, nor detached from, what is the reality in society. In this particular instance, the petitioner keeps harking on the fundamental right to marry and by extension, right to same-sex marriage, claiming that it is a constitutional right pursuant to the guarantee of equal protection. However, there is nothing in the text or background of the constitutional provision that would allow for such an expansive reading. To society, the framers of the Fundamental Law, and the people who ratified it, there is no indication that they understood marriage to be other than the union between people of the opposite sex. This has been the traditional, history-bound understanding of marriage in Philippine setting. Accordingly, if a radical or seismic departure from the commonly understood notion of marriage is to be had, the same has to be decreed by Congress and the President, and not imposed by judicial fiat. Debates about policy on matters like this are for the political departments, as elected representatives of the people, to decide on. </p><p> In regard to the American case recognizing same-sex marriages, the U.S. Supreme Court itself was quite careful to make reference to the changing social milieu which allowed for a shift in legal thinking. We do not have a similar situation here. What the U.S. Supreme Court said in this regard is quite instructive: </p><blockquote> <p> The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution—even as confined to opposite-sex relations—has evolved over time. </p> <p> For example, marriage was once viewed as an arrangement by the couple's parents based on political, religious, and financial concerns; but by the time of the Nation's founding it was understood to be a voluntary contract between a man and a woman. See N. Cott, Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 9-17 (2000); S. Coontz, Marriage, A History 15-16 (2005). As the role and status of women changed, the institution further evolved. Under the centuries-old doctrine of coverture, a married man and woman were treated by the State as a single, male-dominated legal entity. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 430 (1765). As women gained legal, political, and property rights, and as society began to understand that women have their own equal dignity, the law of coverture was abandoned. See Brief for Historians of Marriage et al. as Amici Curiae 16-19. These and other developments in the institution of marriage over the past centuries were not mere superficial changes. Rather, they worked deep transformations in its structure, affecting aspects of marriage long viewed by many as essential. See generally N. Cott, Public Vows; S. Coontz, Marriage; H. Hartog, Man &amp; Wife in America: A History (2000). </p> <p> These new insights have strengthened, not weakened, the institution of marriage. Indeed, changed understandings of marriage are characteristic of a Nation where new dimensions of freedom become apparent to new generations, often through perspectives that begin in pleas or protests and then are considered in the political sphere and the judicial process. </p> <p> This dynamic can be seen in the Nation's experiences with the rights of gays and lesbians. Until the mid-20th century, same-sex intimacy long had been condemned as immoral by the state itself in most Western nations, a belief often embodied in the criminal law. For this reason, among others, many persons did not deem homosexuals to have dignity in their own distinct identity. A truthful declaration by same-sex couples of what was in their hearts had to remain unspoken. Even when a greater awareness of the humanity and integrity of homosexual persons came in the period after World War II, the argument that gays and lesbians had a just claim to dignity was in conflict with both law and widespread social conventions. Same-sex intimacy remained a crime in many States. Gays and lesbians were prohibited from most government employment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to associate. See Brief for Organization of American Historians as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>5-28. </p> <p> For much of the 20th century, moreover, homosexuality was treated as an illness. When the American Psychiatric Association published the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1952, homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, a position adhered to until 1973. See Position Statement on Homosexuality and Civil Rights, 1973, in 131 Am. J. Psychiatry 497 (1974). Only in more recent years have psychiatrists and others recognized that sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable. See Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-17. </p> <p> In the late 20th century, following substantial cultural and political developments, same-sex couples began to lead more open and public lives and to establish families. This development was followed by a quite extensive discussion of the issue in both governmental and private sectors and by a shift in public attitudes toward greater tolerance. As a result, questions about the rights of gays and lesbians soon reached the courts, where the issue could be discussed in the formal discourse of the law. </p> <p> This Court first gave detailed consideration to the legal status of homosexuals in<i> Bowers v. Hardwick,</i> 478 U.S. 186 (1986). There it upheld the constitutionality of a Georgia law deemed to criminalize certain homosexual acts. Ten years later, in <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), the Court invalidated an amendment to Colorado's Constitution that sought to foreclose any branch or political subdivision of the State from protecting persons against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Then, in 2003, the Court overruled <i>Bowers</i>, holding that laws making same-sex intimacy a crime "demea[n] the lives of homosexual persons."<i> Lawrence v. Texas</i>, 539 U. S. 558, 575.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> The right to marry is fundamental as a matter of history and tradition, but rights come not from ancient sources alone. They rise, too, from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era. Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In fine, the claim of alleged unconstitutionality of the Family Code provisions defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman has no leg to stand on. It is not for this Court to write into the law purported rights when they are not expressly or by clear implication deemed available under the Fundamental Law. Same-sex marriage is a policy matter better left to the deliberations of the elected officials of the country. <br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Separate Opinion of then Associate Justice Vicente V.

Falcis III (petitioner) is not the proper party to assert a liberty interest in same-sex marriage. He did not suffer any injury as a result of the enforcement of Articles 1 and 2 of Executive Order (EO) No. 209, otherwise known as "The Family Code of the Philippines" (Family Code). The subsequent intervention by Reverend Crescendo "Ceejay" Agbayani, Jr. (Rev. Ceejay), Marlon Felipe (Marlon) of LGTBS Christian Church (LGTBS Church), and Maria Arlyn "Sugar" Ibañez (Sugar),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (collectively, the two couples), did not cure this defect in the petition. </p><p> I also find dismissal to be proper because direct recourse to the Court in this case is unwarranted. Petitioner asserts that he raises legal questions, principally that Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code violate his fundamental right to enter into a same-sex marriage. This, however, cannot be farther from the truth. The issues he raises implicate underlying questions of fact which, in turn, condition the constitutionality of the legal provisions he questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In his exuberant rush to bring this case directly to the Court as both lead party and counsel, petitioner chose to skip building a factual foundation of record upon which the Court can make an informed judgment. The underlying questions of fact that underpin his legal argument include whether: (a) couples of the same-sex can satisfy the essential requirements of marriage equally as heterosexual couples; (b) procreation is an essential requirement of marriage; (c) couples of the same-sex can raise children equally as well as heterosexual couples; (d) Filipino tradition accepts same-sex marriage; and (e) the LGBTS Church is a religion whose members, including the two couples, hold a sincere belief in same-sex marriage as a central tenet of their faith. </p><p align="center"> I</p><p align="center"> A </p><p>The petition presents no actual case or controversy.</p><p> There is an actual case or controversy when the case is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory, lest the decision of the court would amount to an advisory opinion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This means that there must be a conflict of legal rights or an assertion of opposite legal claims which can be resolved on the basis of existing law and jurisprudence. An abstract dispute, in stark contrast, only seeks for an opinion that advises what the law would be on hypothetical state of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Furthermore, a case is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it.

He does not assail the validity of an election law, so he also does not have standing as a voter. Finally, he is not a legislator nor an association and therefore cannot claim standing as such. </p><p align="center"> C </p><p> The petition-in-intervention cannot cure the defects of the petition. </p><p> An intervention is merely ancillary and supplemental to an existing litigation. It is not an independent action. It presupposes the pendency of a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction; in other words, jurisdiction over the same is governed by jurisdiction over the main action. Perforce, a court which has no jurisdiction over the principal action has no jurisdiction over a complaint-in-intervention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> As stated earlier, the petition before Us lacks the essential requisites for judicial review. This ousts the Court of jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same. More, jurisprudence instructs that a petition-in-intervention cannot create an actual controversy for the main petition. The cause of action must be made out by the allegations of the petition without the aid of any other pleading.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> In any event, the petition-in-intervention is, in itself, wanting and cannot lend any validity to the main petition. The LGBTS Church, while claiming to intervene on behalf of its members, failed to satisfy the following requirements to successfully maintain third-party standing: (1) the litigant must have suffered an 'injury-in-fact,' thus giving him/her a "sufficiently concrete interest" in the outcome of the case in dispute; (2) the litigant must have a close relation to the third party; and (3) there must be some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his/her own interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The first and third elements are missing. As will be discussed in detail later, the LGBTS Church failed to show how the challenged law injures it and its members. On the other hand, the filing of the petition-in-intervention by the two couples, who are members of the LGBTS Church, proved that they are sufficiently capable to acting to protect their own interest. Any invocation of third party-standing is thus misplaced. </p><p align="center"> D </p><p> Neither can the transcendental importance doctrine save the petition and the petition-in-intervention. This doctrine dispenses only with the requirement of<em> locus standi</em>. It does not override the requirements of actual and justiciable controversy, a condition <em>sine qua non</em> for the exercise of judicial power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Very recently in <em>Gios-Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court held that mere invocation of the transcendental importance doctrine cannot, absent a showing that the issue raised is one of law, excuse a violation of the rule on hierarchy of courts. Hence, when a question before the Court involves the determination of factual issues indispensable to the resolution of a legal issue, the Court will refuse to resolve the factual question regardless of the invocation of the transcendental or paramount importance of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p align="center"> II </p><p> As stated at the outset, the petition and the petition-in-intervention raise issues which the Court cannot resolve in the absence of a factual foundation of record. Their decision to bring the case directly before the Court is unwarranted and constitutes ground for the outright dismissal of the petition. </p><p> While the Court has original and concurrent jurisdiction with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and the Court of Appeals (CA) over petitions seeking the issuance of writs of <em>certiorari</em> and prohibition, litigants do not have unfettered discretion to invoke the Court's original jurisdiction. The doctrine of hierarchy of courts dictates that direct recourse to this Court is allowed only to resolve questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> I note that petitioner did couch his petition and the petition-in-intervention in a manner as to purport to present a pure legal question, that is, whether Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code are constitutional. He argued that the assailed provisions are unconstitutional because they violate his (and other homosexuals'): (1) due process right/liberty to marry a person of the same-sex;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (2) right to equal protection of the laws;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and (3) right to found a family within a marriage in accord with their religious convictions under Section 3(1), Article VX of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Before this Court can reach the issue of constitutionality, however, it first needs to determine whether petitioner's asserted liberty interest exists.

Traditionally, liberty interests are protected only against <em>arbitrary</em> government interference. If the government can show a <em>rational </em>basis for believing that its interference advances a legitimate legislative objective, a claim to a liberty interest may fail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Where, however, a liberty interest has been accorded an "elevated" status - that is, by characterizing it as a right (or a fundamental right), then the government is subject to a <em>higher</em> burden of proof to justify intrusions into these interests, namely, the requirements of strict scrutiny in equal protection cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that of compelling state interest in due process cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> As the United States Supreme Court (US Supreme Court) has warned, affixing the label "fundamental" to such liberty interests would place them outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Resultantly, and as is also true in this jurisdiction, fundamental rights have been deemed to include only those basic liberties explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p align="center"> B </p><p> There seems to me little disagreement as to the "fundamental" nature of an asserted liberty interest when the same can be read from the text of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution itself. Thus, when a state act is alleged to have implicated an <strong>explicit </strong>"fundamental right,"<em> i.e</em>., a right textually found in the Bill of Rights, the Court has been wont to subject the government to a <em>higher</em> burden to justify its challenged action: This the Court did in <em>Ebralinag v.

Justice Harlan of the US Supreme Court has famously noted that "the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in, or limited by, the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> In this jurisdiction, this Court has had occasion to rule on assertions of <b>unenumerated</b> fundamental rights: </p><p> In the 1924 case of <i>People v. Pomar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and reminiscent of the <em>Lochner</em>-era rulings, this Court declared unconstitutional provisions of law which required employers to pay a woman employee, who may become pregnant, her wages for 30 days before and 30 days after confinement. Citing a long line of US Supreme Court <em>Lochner</em>-era decisions, this Court found that the right to liberty includes <b>the right to enter into (and terminate) contracts</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> Philippine adherence to this ruling would, however, be short-lived.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> As Justice Fernando would later explain in <em>Edu v.

The Court (and the Constitutional Convention) would adopt a more deferential attitude towards government regulation of economic relations and covering such subjects as "collective bargaining, security of tenure, minimum wages, compulsory arbitration, the regulation of tenancy as well as the issuance of securities, and control of public services."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> In the meantime, and taking its cue from the US Supreme Court, this Court would also go on to recognize unenumerated, yet fundamental, non-economic rights. For example, although the Bill of Rights speaks only of a right of privacy over communication and correspondence, the Court, in the 1968 case of <em>Morfe v. Mutuc</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> adopted the reasoning in<em> Griswold </em>and recognized a constitutional right to<em> personal </em>privacy. In <em>Oposa v.

According to Justice Harlan, speaking in the context of identifying the full scope of liberty protected under the Due Process Clause, the endeavor essentially entails an attempt at finding a balance between "respect for the liberty of the individual x x x and the demands of organized society."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> The question that presents itself then is <b>how</b> one determines whether an implied liberty interest being asserted is "fundamental," as to call for the application of strict scrutiny. For its part, the US Supreme Court has attempted, over time, to craft principled formulations on how to identify such "unenumerated" or "implied" rights: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [T]he Court has used a wide variety of methods, ranging from the restrained approach of locating protected interests in the constitutional text to the generous test of evaluating interests by the importance they have for contemporary individuals. Because the Justices do not uniformly agree upon these methods, it is also understandable that opinions for the Court rarely express consensus about the way the methods are chosen, or whether they fit into the hierarchy, or whether some methods are preferable in some situations and others in other situations. x x x</p> <p> These methods lie along a continuum, all the way from hair-trigger formulas that can support a cornucopia of fundamental rights to stingy theories that protect virtually nothing that is not undeniably enumerated, xxx [n]o one method is comprehensive or exclusive, and indeed, the Justices themselves often have used two or three different theories in combination while analyzing a single interest. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>This </i>Court has not laid down clear guidelines on this matter. Thus, reference to American scholarly commentary is again instructive. </p><p> In his article <i>An Excess of Methods: Identifying Implied Fundamental Rights in the Supreme Court</i>, Robert Farrell wrote that the US Supreme Court uses "a multiplicity of methods of identifying implied fundamental rights."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> After a survey of US Supreme Court cases, Farrell has classified the different methods used by the Court in categorizing certain rights as fundamental.

In fact, one would find critiques for every approach in scholarly commentaries on the subject.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Nevertheless, and despite the particular shortcomings of each individual approach, it is my view that the Court should endeavor to be deliberate and open about its choice of approach in fundamental rights cases. This, to my mind, would help greatly not only in furthering the public's understanding of the Court's decisions in complex constitutional cases; it would reinforce the credibility of Our decisions, by exacting upon the Court and its members the duty to clearly and consistently articulate the bases of its decisions in difficult constitutional cases.</p><p align="center">A</p><p> The method by which the US Supreme Court determined the existence of the fundamental right to same-sex marriage in <i>Obergefell v.

The plaintiffs in <em>Obergefell</em> did not file a suit directly to the US Supreme Court.

The compelling state interests in procreation, foundation of the family, and preservation of the tradition and history of marriage, are enshrined in the Constitution. The CRG maintains that limiting civil marriages to opposite-sex couples is not unconstitutional simply because a particular religion or religious group claims that it goes against their religious beliefs.

Second, petitioner and the petitioners-intervenors must demonstrate that they hold a sincere belief in this tenet.

The US Supreme Court did not uphold the fundamental right to procreate on the basis of any language in the Bill of Rights; rather, it simply asserted, based on an incontrovertible fact of human existence, that marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race. This appears to be the test/approach considered and used by the Court in <em>Oposa v. Factoran, Jr.,</em> G.R.

In <em>Palko v.

There, the accused, who was initially convicted for the crime of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life in prison, was, upon re-trial, convicted for the crime of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. An action to challenge said state statute was brought before the US Supreme Court which thereafter upheld it, saying "[t]he right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a 'principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.'"

In seeming rejection of the importance test, the US Supreme Court declared: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [T]he importance of a service performed by the State does not determine whether it must be regarded as fundamental for purposes of examination under the Equal Protection Clause. xxx</p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <p> It is not the province of this Court to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.

Under this approach, the test of whether or not a right is fundamental is to be determined by whether or not it is rooted in our Nation's history and traditions that is, whether the asserted liberty has been the subject of traditional or historical protection (See also Crump, "<em>How Do the Courts Really Discover Unenumerated Fundamental Rights</em> — <i>Cataloguing the Methods of Judicial Alchemy" supra</i> note 58 at 860). In <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>, the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia sodomy statute. It claimed that the right asserted, which it described as "the claimed constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy" was not considered fundamental within the nation's history and traditions, as is evidenced by a slew of anti-sodomy acts from the time of the enactment of the Bill of Rights to about the time the case was decided. See also the 1934 case of <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts</em>, 291 U.S. 97 (1934), where an accused sought to challenge his conviction for the crime of murder on the ground that he was denied permission to attend a view, which was ordered by the court on motion of the prosecution, at the opening of the trial. The jurors, under a sworn bailiff, visited the scene of the crime, accompanied by the judge, the counsel for both parties, and the court stenographer. The Court affirmed the conviction as there was no showing that there was a history or tradition in the State of Massachusetts affording the accused such right. It held that "[t]he constitution and statutes and judicial decisions of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are the authentic forms through which the sense of justice of the People of that Commonwealth expresses itself in law. We are not to supersede them on the ground that they deny the essentials of a trial because opinions may differ as to their policy or fairness." For more recent applications, see<em> Michael H. v. Gerald D</em>., 491 U.S. 110, 130 (1989) and <em>Washington v. Glucksberg</em>, 521 U.S. 702 (1997). See, however, <em>J</em>. Kennedy's Opinion in <em>Obergefell v.

In the case of <em>Rochin v. California</em>, 342 U.S. 165 (1952), the US Supreme Court held that the act of the police in arranging to have a suspect's stomach pumped to produce evidence of illegal drugs constituted a kind of conduct that "shocks the conscience" and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. This test was again seen appropriate to evaluate "abusive executive action," which in said case was a police car chase which resulted in the death of one of those being chased. The Court eventually found in favor of government as what was determinant of whether the challenged action "shocks the conscience" was not negligence or deliberate indifference but whether there was "an intent to harm suspects physically or worsen their legal plight."

According to the Court, while unwritten in the Constitution, the right to travel is "fundamental to the concept of our Federal Union," which was, by and large, made up of several sovereign states coming together. </p><p> The New Union would not have been possible, and would have made no sense, unless citizens of that Union were free to travel from one end of it to another.

In <i>Escritor</i>, the Court is confronted with the issue of whether Escritor's claim of religious freedom could warrant carving out an exemption from the Civil Service Law. Escritor, a court interpreter, was charged with immorality because she cohabited with a man other than her husband during the subsistence of her marriage. In her defense, Escritor countered that Jehovah's Witnesses, a religious sect to which she is a member, legitimizes a union which is otherwise adulterous or bigamous provided that the parties sign a Declaration of Faithfulness. She and her partner executed and signed a Declaration of Faithfulness in 1991, thus they are regarded by their Church as husband and wife. In resolving the case, the Court inquired into three things: (1) whether Escritor's right to religious freedom has been burdened; (2) whether Escritor is sincere in her religious belief; and (3) whether the state has compelling interest to override Escritor's religious belief and practice. </p></div>
