Under these Rules, the pertinent provisions on appeal substantially remained the same. Section 1, Rule V of the 2009 Revised Rules of COA states that "<i>an aggrieved party may appeal from the decision of the Auditor to the Director who has jurisdiction over the agency under audit</i>." In turn, Section 7, Rule V of the 2009 Revised Rules of COA provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. <i>Power of Director on Appeal</i>. - The Director may affirm, reverse, modify or alter the decision of the Auditor. If the Director reverses, modifies or alters the decision of the Auditor, the case shall be elevated directly to the Commission Proper for automatic review of the Directors’ decision. The dispositive portion of the Director’s decision shall categorically state that the decision is not final and is subject to automatic review by the CP.<br></blockquote>In this case, however, observance of the aforementioned rules of procedure was impracticable. Here, the investigation of the case was conducted by a special team of auditors, and this team was headed by Atty. Roy L. Ursal (Ursal), the Regional Director himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Through LAS Office Order No. 2007-S-009, Director Ursal, Atty. Federico E. Dinapo, Jr., Atty. Marites E.

Further, the COA noted the investigating team’s observation that the SDAs and the project proposals, which were attached to certain disbursement vouchers (DVs), were executed prior to the dates of the alleged advertisement and bidding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, the COA upheld the investigating team’s conclusion that the SDAs could not have been the result of the purported bidding.<br><br>In his petition, petitioner strongly insists that "the bidding process and the disbursement of the expense for the Information Technology Project of the City of Talisay were all done in accordance with law and at no disadvantage to the government whatsoever."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Quite the contrary, however, he admits in his Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> that the City of Talisay directly contracted with PowerDev. He asserts that "[t]he choice of directly contracting with PowerDev brought advantages to the City as it expedited the process, and most importantly is that the desired and much needed automation of its processes were accomplished in a short period of time".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> He adds that "by contracting directly with PowerDev, [he] was able to save time, resources and costs in producing the much needed automation, complying with the 3<sup>rd</sup> requirement of the aforesaid rule, that the 'method chosen promotes economy and efficiency, and that the most advantageous price for the government is obtained.<sup>'"</sup><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Beyond doubt, the COA was correct in concluding that no public biddings were conducted for the computerization project. Anent the contention that the City of Talisay validly resorted to direct contracting as an alternative method of procurement, the Court finds it to be unworthy of consideration. It is evident that such claim is a mere afterthought. Also, if it was indeed the intention of the City of Talisay to resort to direct contracting, it remains questionable that all the SDAs and project proposals were supported by bidding documents, including Advertisement to Bid, Abstract of Bids/Canvass, TWG Resolutions, and BAC Minutes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> These documents were not necessary in direct contracting as this method of procurement "does not require elaborate Bidding Documents because the supplier is simply asked to submit a price quotation or a <i>pro-forma</i> invoice together with the conditions of sale, which offer may be accepted immediately or after some negotiations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In addition, petitioner has not clearly shown any of the allowed conditions for direct contracting, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Procurement of Goods of proprietary nature, which can be obtained only from the proprietary source, i.e. when patents, trade secrets and copyrights prohibit others from manufacturing the same item; </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the Procurement of critical components from a specific manufacturer, supplier or distributor is a condition precedent to hold a contractor to guarantee its project performance, in accordance with the provisions of his contract; or, </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer, which does not have subdealers selling at lower prices and for which no suitable substitute can be obtained at more advantageous terms to the Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The COA also observed the lack of an appropriation ordinance for the realignment of funds. This contravenes RA 7160 or the "Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991," which entails the passage of an ordinance in order for a local government to realign its budget. The pertinent provisions are Sections 336 and 346 thereof, which provide:<br><blockquote>Sec. 336. <i>Use of Appropriations Funds and Savings</i>. - Funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated. No ordinance shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations from one item to another. However, the local chief executive or the presiding officer of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned may, by ordinance, be authorized to augment any item in the approved annual budget for their respective offices from savings in other items within the same expense class of their respective appropriations.<br><br>Sec. 346. <i>Disbursements of Local Funds and Statement of Accounts</i>. - Disbursement shall be made in accordance with the ordinance authorizing the annual or supplemental appropriations without the prior approval of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned. Within thirty (30) days after the close of each month, the local accountant shall furnish the <i>sanggunian</i> with such financial statements as may be prescribed by the COA. In the case of the year-end statement of accounts, the period shall be sixty (60) days after the thirty-first (31<sup>st</sup>) of December.<br></blockquote>Petitioner argues that the passage of an ordinance had been rendered moot as the funds were already realigned and disbursed. Through the Executive Orders (EOs)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> issued by petitioner and former City Mayor Gullas, funds were taken from the savings from various items in the city budget and the 20% Development Fund and transferred to Information Technology Equipment and Software.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In view thereof, petitioner contends that the only proper act that the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> (SP) could make was to pass a resolution ratifying the realignment of funds. Thus, he asserts that the passage of SP Resolution No. 2006-79 for the ratification of the realignment of funds has the same effect as that of an appropriation ordinance.<br><br>In his memorandum, petitioner also avers that the SP, through 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Resolution No. 2009-105 and 1<sup>st</sup> SP Resolution No. 2001-45, granted him and Gullas, respectively, the authority to represent the City of Talisay "in all contracts and memoranda of agreement made pursuant to a law or ordinance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> He argues that by virtue of these Resolutions, he and Gullas were legally authorized to proceed with the execution of the SDAs.<br><br>The foregoing arguments are untenable. <br><br>As stated in Section 336 of the LGC, the general rule is that funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated. The exception to this is when the local chief executive is <i>authorized by ordinance</i> to augment any item in the approved annual budget from savings in other items within the same expense class. In other words, Section 336 of the LGC requires an implementing ordinance so that the local chief executive can augment items in the annual budget of the local government unit. Thus, the appropriation ordinance of a given fiscal year must expressly authorize the local chief executive before he can make augmentations in that particular year, or at the very least, he must be authorized by ordinance before he can make augmentations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In this case, 3<sup>rd</sup> SP Resolution No. 2009-105 and 1<sup>st</sup> SP Resolution No. 2001-45, which purportedly granted petitioner and Gullas the authority to represent the City of Talisay in all contracts and memoranda of agreement made pursuant to a law or ordinance, do not have the force of the required ordinance that must expressly authorize the local chief executive to make augmentations or realignments in the city budget. Likewise, SP Resolution No. 2006-79, purportedly ratifying the realignment of funds to finance the computerization project through the aforesaid EOs issued by petitioner and Gullas, has no curative effect.<br><br>It must also be emphasized that the power of the local chief executive to augment items under Section 336 of the LGC is a mere exception to the general rule that funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated.

Thus:<br><blockquote><b>1. The City of Talisay submitted two (2) different sets of BAC Minutes for the same BAC meeting allegedly held on 16 December 2005.</b><br><br>The first BAC Minutes [dated December 16, 2005], which was attached to support DV No. [sic] DV No. 300-0512-2510 for the payment to Gracias Industries does not include in the listing of the lowest bidders, the name Gracias Industries. Instead, it lists as lowest bidder for liquid fertilizer Joseth Trading. This is the last entry of bidders on the second page and signed by Geralie P. Alob, the designated recorder of the BAC meeting.<br><br>Subsequently, the City of Talisay submitted a folder of documents in support of its defense against the disallowance. This time, it submitted another BAC Minutes [likewise dated December 16, 2005], but instead of Joseth Trading as the lowest bidder recorded therein, it was Gracias Industries already. Also, this time, the lowest bidder for the liquid fertilizer is not anymore the last entry of the BAC minutes, but an additional five (5) entries of lowest bidders for different products and services were included, which did not appear in the BAC minutes attached to the DV.<br><br>The team hereby puts in issue the authenticity of the said two BAC Minutes. This discrepancy, if not satisfactorily explained by the City of Talisay, including its Designated Recorder of the BAC meeting, raises serious doubt as to the authenticity of these particular bidding documents and of the alleged bidding itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner argues that the foregoing finding is terribly flawed because it is not duly supported by evidence and it failed to properly consider the facts surrounding the purchase. He asserts that it was the Department of Agriculture (DA), which approached the City of Talisay and informed it that there was an on-going government project on the distribution of fertilizers to qualified beneficiaries, and that the funds therefor were already available. He adds that all that the City of Talisay had to do was to identify potential beneficiaries and conduct a bidding for the potential suppliers.<br><br>Petitioner also asserts that neither he nor any personnel from the City of Talisay was informed of and witnessed the alleged testing conducted by the COA Technical Services Offices, which concluded that the price of the liquid fertilizers purchased was bloated and that the contents thereof were not within the specified label in the bottle.<br><br>Further, petitioner denies the COA’s claim that there were two sets of minutes of the December 16, 2005 BAC meeting. He asserts that the minutes of the BAC meeting which was submitted on December 21, 2007 to the Regional Director of COA Regional Office No. VII was the complete minutes of the BAC meeting held on December 16, 2005. Thus, he claims that the minutes attached to DV No. 300-0512-2510 was an incomplete one; and as borne out by the complete minutes, Gracias Industries who participated in the bidding and offered the lowest bid was awarded the contract.<br><br>Additionally, petitioner argues that the matter of whether the price of the lowest bidder is higher than the price of other suppliers in the market who did not participate in the bidding is already beyond the scope of responsibility of the BAC. Hence, petitioner maintains that the members of the BAC of the City of Talisay and other personnel who participated in the transaction cannot be held liable for the alleged overpricing especially in the absence of any proof or evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the BAC.<br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>At this juncture, it bears to emphasize that the findings of fact of administrative agencies are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Such findings must be respected as long as they are supported by substantial evidence, even if such evidence is not overwhelming or even preponderant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> By reason of their special knowledge and expertise over matters falling under their jurisdiction, administrative agencies are in a better position to pass judgment thereon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In <i>Delos Santos, et al. v.

It is tasked to be vigilant and conscientious in safeguarding the proper use of the government’s, and ultimately the people’s, property. The exercise of its general audit power is among the constitutional mechanisms that gives life to the check and balance system inherent in our form of government.<br><br>Corollary thereto, it is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created, such as the CoA, not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws they are entrusted to enforce. Findings of administrative agencies are accorded not only respect but also finality when the decision and order are not tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion.

Besides, regardless of whether the City of Talisay was indeed merely acting under the direction of the DA, and of whether the bidding documents submitted by petitioner were authentic, it cannot be denied that there was irresponsibility and lack of prudence on the part of the City of Talisay when it neglected to determine the prevailing price of the liquid fertilizer. It patently took the risk of not getting the most advantageous price for the government.<br><br>As found by the COA, the <i>lowest</i> price per liter of the liquid fertilizer, as offered in the alleged bidding and purchased by the City of Talisay, was P900.00. On the other hand, the <i>highest</i> selling price per liter, obtained by the ATL through canvass and actual purchase from Pacifica Agrivet, was P171.00 per liter plus 10% thereof, or P188.10. Hence, there appears a considerably huge unit overprice of P711.90, which the Court cannot brush aside.<br><br>It is a declared policy of the State that "<i>all resources of the government shall be managed, expended or utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage through illegal or improper disposition, with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of government</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Corollary thereto, RA 9184 requires that the procuring entity shall, in all instances, ensure that the approved budget for the contract reflects the most advantageous prevailing price for the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Apparently, the City of Talisay failed in abiding by the mandate of the law.<br><br>Consequently, ND No. 2007-002 dated July 23, 2007, disallowing the overprice in the purchase of liquid fertilizers in the amount of P2,372,762.70, should be sustained.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="justify"><i>III.

Hence, they should be held personally liable for the disallowed amounts.<br><br>In <i>Verceles, Jr. v. COA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Leandro B, Verceles, Jr. (Verceles), who was then the Provincial Governor of Catanduanes, was found personally liable because his acts of: (1) making augmentations without prior authority; and (2) entering into a contract on behalf of the province without requisite authority were in violation of the LGC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The Court held that Verceles’ reliance on, among others, the opinion of the Department of Interior and Local Government, could not exculpate him from his personal liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It declared that Section 336 of the LGC and Section 26 of the Province’s appropriation ordinance in CY 2002, in clear and precise language, required the authority from the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> before the governor could make augmentations or realignments of funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, Atty.

Moreover, there was violation of RA 9184, specifically Section 10, Article IV in relation to Article XVI thereof, in view of the failure to conduct the required competitive bidding or the failure to show circumstances justifying the resort to any of the alternative methods of procurement. Evidently, the patent violations of the LGC and of the procurement requirements under RA 9184 negated the presumptions of good faith and regularity in the performance of official duties in favor of petitioner and the other persons liable under the NDs.<br><br>As to the purchase of liquid fertilizers, good faith is likewise absent considering that the City of Talisay disregarded Section 36, Article X of RA 9184 by neglecting to obtain the most advantageous price for the government. The alleged <i>lowest</i> price of P900 per unit as offered in the alleged bidding is remarkably excessive and unreasonable considering that the <i>highest</i> price obtained through canvass and actual purchase by the ATL from Pacifica Agrivet was only P188.10 per unit. Further, the Court notes the COA’s finding of irregularity with respect to the bidding documents submitted by petitioner which raise doubts as to their authenticity as well as the authenticity of the bidding itself. In this regard, the Court finds that petitioner and the other persons named liable for the overpriced liquid fertilizers were not in good faith while discharging their official duties.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is worthy to note the ruling in <i>Joson III v. COA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> where Tomas N. Joson III (Joson) assailed the denial by the COA of his petition for exclusion from liability for the disallowed amount. The Court pronounced that Joson, being the head of the procuring entity and the Governor of Nueva Ecija, is not automatically the party ultimately liable for the disallowed amount. It declared that he cannot be held liable simply because he was the final approving authority of the transaction in question and that the employees/officers who processed the same were under his supervision. Thus:<br><blockquote>The payments to A.V.T. Construction was disallowed by COA for the reason that the pre-qualification or eligibility checklist using the “pass/fail” criteria, the Net Financial Contracting Capacity (NFCC), and Technical Eligibility documents are missing.<br><br>It is well to note that the missing documents, the eligibility checklist using the pass/fail criteria, the NFCC and the technical eligibility documents, pertain to the pre-qualification stage of the bidding process. <br><br>Under R.A. No. 9184, the determination of whether a prospective bidder is eligible or not falls on the BAC. The BAC sets out to determine the eligibility of the prospective bidders based on their compliance with the eligibility requirements set forth in the Invitation to Bid and their submission of the legal, technical and financial documents required under Sec. 23.6, Rule VIII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9184.<br><br>Thus, the presence of the eligibility checklist, the NFCC and the technical eligibility documents are the obligations and duties of the BAC. The absence of such documents are the direct responsibility of the BAC. Petitioner had no hand in the preparation of the same. He cannot therefore be held liable for its absence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote>Under the circumstances of the present case, however, the Court is not inclined to apply the same ruling.
