CR-HC No. 07178, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> rendered on 11 December 2014&nbsp; by Branch 2. Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, in Criminal Case No. 13-299147, finding accused-appellant Esrafel Dayon y Mali @·"Bong" (accused­ appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic&nbsp; Act (RA) 9165, otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><div align="center"><b>Antecedents</b><br></div><br>On 14 August 2013, an Information was filed charging accused-­appellant with illegal sale of shabu, defined and punished under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, to wit:<br><blockquote>That on or about <b>August 06, 2013</b>, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused not having been authorized by law to sell, trade, deliver, transport or distribute or give away to another any dangerous drug, did then and there will fully, unlawfully and knowingly sell or offer for sale to a police officer / poseur[-]buyer one <b>(1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet marked as "BONG" containing ZERO POINT ZERO FOUR ZERO (0.040) gram of white crystalline substance</b> commonly known as Shabu, containing Metamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded "not guilty." After the termination of pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br><b><center><br>Version of the Prosecution</center></b><br>On 06 August 2013, a team from the Philippine National Police Moriones Tondo Police Station 2, in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, conducted a buy-bust operation in Tondo, Manila, against a certain "Bong," which they later identified as accused-appellant. During the buy-bust, accused-appellant sold and handed to the poseur-buyer one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance suspected to be <i>shabu</i>. The team photographed, marked, and inventoried the seized item at the place of arrest in the presence of accused­-appellant, as well as a member of the media, and claimed efforts were made to summon <i>barangay</i> officials, but the latter refused due to fear of reprisal and notoriety or the place of arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thereafter, the seized item was brought to the crime laboratory, which confirmed that the plastic sachet contained 0.040 gram of metamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><center><br>Version of the Defense</center></b><br>Accused-appellant denied the charges against him and averred he was arrested on 05 August 2013 while on his way to 168 Mall in Divisoria.&nbsp; He was approached by three (3) men in civilian clothing, and frisked. One of the men said, "<i>isama na rin yan</i>," (include him also). He saw that there was another man, already handcuffed, in the <i>kuliglig</i>, a motorized pedicab, he was made to board. When accused-appellant asked the other man where they were going, the latter replied, "<i>sa prisinto</i>," (to the precinct). He found out later that the man with him in the <i>kuliglig </i>was named Bong. When confronted with the marked photograph of his arrest with another man, accused-appellant explained that the photograph was taken at the precinct where the police officers just placed evidence on his lap, and the name of the other man in the photograph was Bong. Accused-appellant insisted his nickname was "<i>Piyel</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Accused-appellant further claimed the police officers demanded P100,000.00 from him in exchange for his release.&nbsp; He told them it was impossible for him to come up with that amount as he was jobless and his wife earned only P170.00 per day. They told him, "<i>kayang-­kaya mo, tawagan mo yung magulang mo</i>," (you can afford it, call your parents).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><center><br><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>On 11 December 2014, the RTC convicted accused-appellant of the crime charged.

The presentation of the seized drugs as evidence in court is indispensable in every prosecution for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs because the drugs seized are the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime. As such, the State should establish beyond doubt the identity of the dangerous drugs by showing that the drugs offered in court as evidence were the same substances bought during the buy-bust operation. This requirement is complied with by ensuring that the custody of the seized drugs from the time of confiscation&nbsp; until presentation is safeguarded under what is referred to as the chain of custody by RA 9165, whose objective is to remove unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>As part of the chain of custody procedure, RA 9165 requires that the marking, physical inventory, and photographing of the seized items be conducted immediately after their seizure and confiscation. The law further requires that the inventory and photographing be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> "a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u> </i>the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official"; or (b) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 91 65 by RA 10640, "[an) elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <i><u>OR</u> </i>the media." The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Information charges accused-appellant of committing the crime on 06 August 2013, prior to the effectivity of the amendatory law, RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Section 21 of R.A 9165, as complemented by Section 21 (a) of Article II of its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), requires that immediately after seizure and confiscation of the suspected drug, it should be physically inventoried and photographed in the presence of the following witnesses: (a) the accused or person/s from whom the items were seized and confiscated, or his representative or counsel; (b) a representative from the media AND the Department of Justice (DOJ); and (c) any elected public official.<br><br>The marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized items in this case were conducted immediately at the place of the seizure and arrest. But the prosecution failed to establish the crucial presence of ALL witnesses required by R.A. 9165. As testified to by prosecution witness SPO1 Joel Sta. Maria, only a representative from the media was present out of the required third-party Witnesses:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">Q</div></td> <td width="95%" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Now, Mr. Witness. did you take pictures at the place of the arrest?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">A</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">PO3 Jimenez took the picture while I made the marking and the inventory, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">Q</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">But this picture was taken where.

Failure to tender justification will create doubt as to the identity and evidentiary value of the drugs presented as evidence in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> For this saving mechanism to apply, the prosecution must first recognize the lapse or lapses in the prescribed procedures and then explain the lapse or lapses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Thus, the absence of the witnesses required by law does not <i>per se</i> render the confiscated items inadmissible.&nbsp; However, a justifiable reason for such absence, or a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the presence of the required witnesses, must be adduced. The prosecution must show that earnest efforts were employed in contacting the witnesses enumerated in the law.&nbsp; Mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justifiable grounds for non-compliance.&nbsp; Police officers are compelled&nbsp; not only to state the reasons for their non-compliance but must also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedures and that, under the given circumstances, their actions were reasonable<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We have carefully reviewed the records and can find no justification by the arresting team for their procedural lapses.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses did not provide in their testimonies any acknowledgment or explanation for the lack of a DOJ representative and an elected public official.&nbsp; There was no statement of any earnest efforts by the arresting team to contact the required witnesses.<br><br>The Joint Affidavit of Apprehension<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> by the police officers state in part:<br><blockquote>xxxx That effort made in summoning [the] Barangay officials to witness the inventory failed in vain due to the notoriety of the place[,] they refuses (sic) to be part of the incident for fear of reprisal, thus suspects and evidences was (sic) immediately brought at (sic) [the] Police Station, SAID office and turned over for investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court finds this statement in the affidavit flimsy and insufficient to explain the procedural lapse.&nbsp; First, it fails to establish that an actual serious attempt to contact the required witnesses was made by the apprehending officers.&nbsp; Second, it only mentions an effort to summon <i>barangay </i>officials, but the law then prevailing also required the presence of a DOJ representative during the inventory and photographing. Finally, the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proved as a fact because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The purpose of the law in requiring the presence of certain witnesses at the time of the seizure and inventory of the seized items is to insulate the seizure from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Their insulating presence during the inventory and photographing was specifically designed to obviate switching, 'planting' or contamination of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In this case, the arresting officers failed to secure the presence of a DOJ representative and an elected public official without providing any justifiable reason and without proving that they exerted earnest efforts to do so.&nbsp; This failure adversely affected the integrity and credibility of the seized sachet of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; The prosecution had sufficient opportunity during trial to explain the procedural lapses but glaringly left the same unacknowledged and unjustified. Such omission casts suspicion on the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense charged, thereby creating reasonable doubt.<br><br>While We support the government's efforts to combat the proliferation of illegal drugs in Philippine society, the Court maintains the importance of the procedural safeguards in all drug-related cases.&nbsp; Vigilance in eradicating illegal drugs must not come at the expense of disregarding the law, rules and established jurisprudence on the matter.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated 14 December 2015 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
