				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the principal grounds of encroachment upon the rule-making power of the Court concerning the practice of law, violation of institutional academic freedom and violation of a law school aspirant's right to education, these consolidated Petitions for Prohibition (G.R. No. 230642) and <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition (G.R. No. 242954) under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assail as unconstitutional Republic Act (R.A.)

No. 7662 created the LEB, an executive agency which was made separate from the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), but attached thereto solely for budgetary purposes and administrative support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Chairman and regular members of the LEB are to be appointed by the President for a term of five years, without reappointment, from a list of at least three nominees prepared, with prior authorization from the Court, by the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Section 7 of R.A. No. 7662 enumerates the powers and functions of the LEB as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Powers and Functions</i>. - For the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Act, the Board shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>(a) to administer the legal education system in the country in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Act;<br><br>(b) to supervise the law schools in the country, consistent with its powers and functions as herein enumerated;<br><br>(c) to set the standards of accreditation for law schools taking into account, among others, the size of enrollment, the qualifications of the members of the faculty, the library and other facilities, without encroaching upon the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning;<br><br>(d) to accredit law schools that meet the standards of accreditation;<br><br>(e) to prescribe minimum standards for law admission and minimum qualifications and compensation to faculty members;<br><br>(f) to prescribe the basic curricula for the course of study aligned to the requirements for admission to the Bar, law practice and social consciousness, and such other courses of study as may be prescribed by the law schools and colleges under the different levels of accreditation status;<br><br>(g) to establish a law practice internship as a requirement for taking the Bar which a law student shall undergo with any duly accredited private or public law office or firm or legal assistance group anytime during the law course for a specific period that the Board may decide, but not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months. For this purpose, the Board shall prescribe the necessary guidelines for such accreditation and the specifications of such internship which shall include the actual work of a new member of the Bar[;]<br><br>(h) to adopt a system of continuing legal education. For this purpose, the Board may provide for the mandatory attendance of practicing lawyers in such courses and for such duration as the Board may deem necessary; and<br><br>(i) to perform such other functions and prescribe such rules and regulations necessary for the attainment of the policies and objectives of this Act.<br></blockquote>On the matter of accreditation of law schools, R.A. No. 7662 further elaborates:<br><blockquote>SEC. 8. <i>Accreditation of Law Schools</i>. - Educational institutions may not operate a law school unless accredited by the Board. Accreditation of law schools may be granted only to educational institutions recognized by the Government.<br><br>SEC. 9. <i>Withdrawal or Downgrading of Accreditation</i>. - The [LEB] may withdraw or downgrade the accreditation status of a law school if it fails to maintain the standards set for its accreditation status.<br><br>SEC. 10. <i>Effectivity of Withdrawal or Downgrading of Accreditation</i>. - The withdrawal or downgrading of accreditation status shall be effective after the lapse of the semester or trimester following the receipt by the school of the notice of withdrawal or downgrading unless, in the meantime, the school meets and/or upgrades the standards or corrects the deficiencies upon which the withdrawal or downgrading of the accreditation status is based.<br></blockquote><b><i>Bar Matter No. 979-B<br>Re: Legal Education</i></b><br><br>In July 2001, the Court's Committee on Legal Education and Bar Matters (CLEBM), through its Chairperson, Justice Jose C. Vitug, noted several objectionable provisions of R.A. No. 7662 which "go beyond the ambit of education of aspiring lawyers and into the sphere of education of persons duly licensed to practice the law profession."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In particular, the CLEBM observed:<br><blockquote>x x x [U]nder the declaration of policies in Section 2 of [R.A. No. 7662], the State "shall x x x require apprenticeship and continuing legal education." The concept of continuing legal education encompasses education not only of law students but also of members of the legal profession. [This] implies that the [LEB] shall have jurisdiction over the education of persons who have finished the law course and are already licensed to practice law[, in violation of the Supreme Court's power over the Integrated Bar of the Philippines].<br><br>x x x Section 3 provides as one of the objectives of legal education increasing "awareness among members of the legal profession of the needs of the poor, deprived and oppressed sectors of the society." Such objective should not find a place in the law that primarily aims to upgrade the standard of schools of ·law as they perform the task of educating aspiring lawyers. Section 5, paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the Constitution also provides that the Supreme Court shall have the power to promulgate rules on "legal assistance to the underprivileged" and hence, implementation of [R.A. No. 7662] might give rise to infringement of a constitutionally mandated power.<br><br>x x x [Section 7(e) giving the LEB the power to prescribe minimum standards for law admission and Section 7(h) giving the LEB the power to adopt a system of continuing legal education and for this purpose, the LEB may provide for the mandatory attendance of practicing lawyers in such courses and for such duration as the LEB may deem necessary] encroach upon the Supreme Court's powers under Section 5, paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the Constitution. Aside from its power over the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, the Supreme Court is constitutionally mandated to promulgate rules concerning admission to the practice of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>While the CLEBM saw the need for the LEB to oversee the system of legal education, it cautioned that the law's objectionable provisions, for reasons above-cited, must be removed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Relative to the foregoing observations, the CLEBM proposed the following amendments to R.A. No. 7662:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policies</i>. - It is hereby declared the policy of the State to uplift the standards of legal education in order to prepare law students for advocacy, counseling, problem-solving, and decision­-making; to infuse in them the ethics of the legal profession; to impress upon them the importance, nobility and dignity of the legal profession as an equal and indispensable partner of the Bench in the administration of justice; and, to develop socially-committed lawyers with integrity and competence.<br><br><u>Towards this end, the State shall undertake appropriate reforms in the legal education system, require proper selection of law students, provide for legal apprenticeship, and maintain quality among law schools.</u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>General and Specific Objectives of Legal Education</i>. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2.) <u>to increase awareness among law students of the needs of the poor, deprived and oppressed sectors of society</u>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 7. <i>Power and functions</i>. - x x x<br><br>(a) to <u>regulate</u> the legal education system in accordance with its powers and functions herein enumerated;<br><br>(b) to <u>establish standards of accreditation for law schools, consistent with academic freedom and pursuant to the declaration of policy set forth in Section 2</u> hereof;<br><br>(c) to <u>accredit law schools that meet the standards of accreditation</u>; <br><br>(d) to <u>prescribe minimum standards for admission to law schools including a system of law aptitude examination</u>;<br><br>(e) to provide for <u>minimum qualifications for faculty members of law schools</u>;<br><br>(f) to <u>prescribe guidelines for law practice internship which the law schools may establish as part of the curriculum</u>; and<br><br>(g) to perform such <u>other administrative functions as may be necessary for the attainment of the policies and objectives of this Act</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated September 4, 2001, the Court approved the CLEBM's explanatory note and draft amendments to R.A. No. 7662. The Senate and the House of Representatives were formally furnished with a copy of said Resolution. This, notwithstanding, R.A. No. 7662 remained unaltered.<br><br><b><i>LEB Issuances</i></b><br><br>In 2003, the Court issued a resolution authorizing the JBC to commence the nomination process for the members of the LEB. In 2009, the LEB was constituted with the appointment of Retired Court of Appeals Justice Hilarion L. Aquino as the first Chairperson and followed by the appointment of LEB members, namely, Dean Eulogia M. Cueva, Justice Eloy R. Bello, Jr., Dean Venicio S. Flores and Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Director Felizardo Y. Francisco. Despite the passage of the enabling law in 1993, the LEB became fully operational only in June 2010.<br><br>Acting pursuant to its authority to prescribe the minimum standards for law schools, the LEB issued <i>Memorandum Order No. 1, Series of 2011</i> (LEBMO No. 1-2011) providing for the Policies and Standards of Legal Education and Manual of Regulation for Law Schools.<br><br>Since then, the LEB had issued several orders, circulars, resolutions, and other issuances which are made available through their website:<br><br><i>A.

The first PhiLSAT examination was held on April 16, 2017 in seven pilot sites: Baguio City, Metro Manila, Legazpi City, Cebu City, Iloilo City, Davao City, and Cagayan de Oro. A total of 6,575 out of 8,074 examinees passed the first-ever PhiLSAT. For the first PhiLSAT, the passing grade was adjusted by the LEB from 55% to 45% by way of consideration.<br><br>Since the PhiLSAT was implemented for the first time and considering further that there were applicants who failed to take the PhiLSAT because of the inclement weather last April 16, 2017, the LEB issued <i>Memorandum Order No. 11, Series of 2017</i> (LEBMO No. 11-2017).<br><br>Under LEBMO No. 11-2017, those who failed to take the first PhiLSAT were allowed to be admitted to law schools for the first semester of academic year 2017 to 2018 for justifiable or meritorious reasons and conditioned under the following terms:<br><blockquote>2.

It was also therein clarified that the discretion given to law schools to admit those who failed the PhiLSAT during the initial year of implementation is only up to the second semester of academic year 2017-2018.<br><br>Because of the confusion as to whether conditional admission for academic year 2018 to 2019 may still be allowed, the LEB issued <i>Memorandum Circular No. 18, Series of 2018</i> (LEBMC No. 18-2018). Under LEBMC No. 18-2018, it was clarified that the conditional admission was permitted only in academic year 2017 to 2018 as part of the transition adjustments in the initial year of the PhiLSAT implementation. As such, by virtue of LEBMC No. 18-2018, the conditional admission of students previously allowed under LEBMO No. 11-2017 was discontinued.<br><br>Nevertheless, on July 25, 2018, the LEB issued <i>Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 2018</i> (LEBMC No. 19-2018) allowing limited conditional admission/enrollment in the first semester of academic year 2018 to 2019 for those applicants who have never previously taken the PhiLSAT. Those who have taken the PhiLSAT and scored below the cut-off score were disqualified. In addition, only those law schools with a passing rate of not less than 25%, are updated in the reportorial requirement and signified its intention to conditionally admit applicants were allowed to do so. The limited enrollment was subject to the condition that the admitted student shall take and pass the next PhiLSAT on September 23, 2018, otherwise the conditional enrollment shall be nullified. Non-compliance with said circular was considered a violation of the minimum standards for the law program for which law schools may be administratively penalized.<br><br>The fourth PhiLSAT then pushed through on September 23, 2018.<br><br><b><i>The Petitions</i></b><br><br>Days before the scheduled conduct of the first-ever PhiLSAT on April 16, 2017, petitioners Oscar B.

They also argue that the PhiLSAT violates the academic freedom of law schools and the right to education.<br><br>Petitioners-in-intervention meanwhile contend that the PhiLSAT violates the right to liberty and pursuit of happiness of the student-­applicants. They posit that the PhiLSAT violates the equal protection clause as it is an arbitrary form of classification not based on substantial distinctions. They also argue that the PhiLSAT violates the right of all citizens to quality and accessible education, violates academic freedom, and is an unfair academic requirement. It is also their position that the PhiLSAT violates due process as it interferes with the right of every person to select a profession or course of study. They also argue that R.A. No. 7662 constitutes undue delegation of legislative powers.<br><br><b><i>In G.R. No. 242954</i></b><br><br>Petitioners in G.R. No. 242954 argue that <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are proper remedies either under the expanded or traditional jurisdiction of the Court. They also invoke the doctrine of transcendental importance.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Substantively, they contend that R.A. No. 7662, specifically Section 3(a)(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> on the objective of legal education to increase awareness among members of the legal profession, Section 7(e) on law admission, 7(g)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> on law practice internship, and 7(h) on adopting a system of continuing legal education, and the declaration of policy on continuing legal education<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> infringe upon the power of the Court to regulate admission to the practice of law. They profess that they are not against the conduct of law school admission test <i>per se</i>, only that the LEB cannot impose the PhiLSAT as the power to do so allegedly belongs to the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>It is also their contention that the PhiLSAT violates academic freedom as it interferes with the law school's exercise of freedom to choose who to admit. According to them, the LEB cannot issue penal regulations, and the consequent forfeiture of school fees and the ban on enrollment for those who failed to pass the PhiLSAT violate due process.<br><br><b><i>The Comments</i></b><br><br>Procedurally, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing the LEB, argues that <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition are not proper to assail the constitutionality of R.A. No. 7662 either under the traditional or expanded concept of judicial power. For the OSG, R.A. No. 7662 was enacted pursuant to the State's power to regulate all educational institutions, and as such, there could be no grave abuse of discretion. It also claims that the Congress is an indispensable party to the petitions.<br><br>Substantively, the OSG contends that the Court's power to regulate admission to the practice of law does not include regulation of legal education. It also defends Section 7(e) on the LEB's power to prescribe minimum standards for law admission as referring to admission to law schools; Section 7(g) on the LEB's power to establish a law practice internship as pertaining to the law school curriculum which is within the power of the LEB to regulate; and 7(h) on the LEB's power to adopt a system of continuing legal education as being limited to the training of lawyer-professors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Anent the argument that R.A. No. 7662 gives the JBC additional functions not assigned to it by the Court, the OSG points out that the Court had actually authorized the JBC to process the applications for membership to the LEB making this a non-issue.<br><br>In defending the validity of the PhiLSAT, the OSG advances the argument that the PhiLSAT is the minimum standard for entrance to law schools prescribed by the LEB pursuant to the State's power to regulate education. The OSG urges that the PhiLSAT is no different from the National Medical Admission Test (NMAT) which the Court already upheld as a valid exercise of police power in the seminal case of <i>Tablarin v. Gutierrez</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>It is also the position of the OSG that neither the PhiLSAT nor the provisions of R.A. No. 7662 violate academic freedom because the standards for entrance to law school, the standards for accreditation, the prescribed qualifications of faculty members, and the prescribed basic curricula are fair, reasonable, and equitable admission and academic requirements.<br><br>For their part, respondents in-intervention contend that R.A. No. 7662 enjoys the presumption of constitutionality and that the study of law is different from the practice of law.<br><br>In its Comment to the Petition-in-Intervention, the OSG dismisses as speculative the argument that the PhiLSAT is anti-poor, and adds that the Court has no competence to rule on whether the PhiLSAT is an unfair or unreasonable requirement, it being a question of policy.<br><br>Respondents-in-intervention, for their part, argue that the right of the citizens to accessible education means that the State shall make quality education accessible only to those qualified enough, as determined by fair, reasonable, and equitable admission and academic requirements. They dispute the claimed intrusion on academic freedom as law schools are not prevented from selecting who to admit among applicants who have passed the PhiLSAT. They stress that the right to education is not absolute and may be regulated by the State, citing <i>Calawag v. University of the Philippines Visayas</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>By way of Reply, petitioners-in-intervention emphasize that the doctrine in <i>Tablarin</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> is inapplicable as medical schools are not the same as law schools. They further aver that the decline in enrollment as a result of the implementation of the PhiLSAT is not speculative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>After a careful consideration of the issues raised by the parties in their pleadings and refined during the oral arguments, the issues for resolution are synthesized as follows:<br><blockquote>I.

In <i>Pimentel, Jr. v. Aguirre</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><blockquote><i>First,</i> on prematurity. According to the Dissent, when "the conduct has not yet occurred and the challenged construction has not yet been adopted by the agency charged with administering the administrative order, the determination of the scope and constitutionality of the executive action in advance of its immediate adverse effect involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of judicial function."<br><br>This is a rather novel theory - that people should await the implementing evil to befall on them before they can question acts that are illegal or unconstitutional. Be it remembered that the real issue here is whether the Constitution and the law are contravened by Section 4 of AO 372, not whether they are violated by the acts implementing it. In the unanimous <i>en banc case Tañada v. Angara</i>, this Court held that when an act of the legislative department is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, settling the controversy becomes the duty of this Court. <b>By the mere enactment of the questioned law or the approval of the challenged action, the dispute is said to have ripened into a judicial controversy even without any other overt act. Indeed, even a singular violation of the Constitution and/or the law is enough to awaken judicial duty. Said the Court:</b><br><blockquote>In seeking to nullify an act of the Philippine Senate on the ground that it contravenes the Constitution, the petition no doubt raises a justiciable controversy. <b>Where an action of the legislative branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to settle the dispute. The question thus posed is judicial rather than political.</b> The duty (to adjudicate) remains to assure that the supremacy of the Constitution is upheld. Once a controversy as to the application or interpretation of a constitutional provision is raised before this Court x x x, it becomes a legal issue which the Court is bound by constitutional mandate to decide.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As this Court has repeatedly and firmly emphasized in many cases, it will not shirk, digress from or abandon its sacred duty and authority to uphold the Constitution in matters that involve grave abuse of discretion brought before it in appropriate cases, committed by any officer, agency, instrumentality or department of the government.<br></blockquote>In the same vein, the Court also held in <i>Tatad v. Secretary of the Department of Energy</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x Judicial power includes not only the duty of the courts to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also the duty to determine whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. The courts, as guardians of the Constitution, have the inherent authority to determine whether a statute enacted by the legislature transcends the limit imposed by the fundamental law. Where the statute violates the Constitution, it is not only the right but the duty of the judiciary to declare such act unconstitutional and void.<br></blockquote>By the same token, when an act of the President, who in our constitutional scheme is a coequal of Congress, is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution and the laws, as in the present case, settling the dispute becomes the duty and the responsibility of the courts.

After all, the fundamental right to religious freedom, freedom of the press and peaceful assembly are but component rights of the right to one's freedom of expression, as they are modes which one's thoughts are externalized.<br><br>In this jurisdiction, the application of doctrines originating from the U.S. has been generally maintained, albeit with some modifications. <b>While this Court has withheld the application of facial challenges to strictly penal statutes, it has expanded its scope to cover statutes not only regulating free speech, but also those involving religious freedom, and other fundamental rights.</b> The underlying reason for this modification is simple. <b>For unlike its counterpart in the U.S., this Court, under its expanded jurisdiction, is mandated by the Fundamental Law not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. Verily, the framers of Our Constitution envisioned a proactive Judiciary, ever vigilant with its duty to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution.</b><br><br><b>Consequently, considering that the foregoing petitions have seriously alleged that the constitutional human rights to life, speech and religion and other fundamental rights mentioned above have been violated by the assailed legislation, the Court has authority to take cognizance of these kindred petitions and to determine if the RH Law can indeed pass constitutional scrutiny.</b> To dismiss these petitions on the simple expedient that there exist no actual case or controversy, would diminish this Court as a reactive branch of government, acting only when the Fundamental Law has been transgressed, to the detriment of the Filipino people.

DECS Order No. 27-1989 specifically outlined the policies and standards for legal education, and superseded all existing policies and standards related to legal education. These policies were made applicable beginning school year 1989 to 1990.<br><br>"Legal education" was defined in DECS Order No. 27-1989 as an educational program including a clinical program appropriate and essential in the understanding and application of law and the administration of justice. It is professional education after completion of a required pre-legal education at the college level. For state colleges and universities, the operation of their law schools was to depend on their respective charters, and for private colleges and universities, by the rules and regulations issued by the DECS. Nevertheless, it was made clear under DECS Order No. 27-1989 that the administration of a law school shall be governed primarily by the law school's own policies and the provisions thereof apply only suppletorily.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>Likewise, in generally permissive terms, DECS Order No. 27-1989 prescribed the preferred qualifications and functions of a law dean, as well as the preferred qualifications, conditions of employment and teaching load of law faculty members.

The DECS also drew a model law curriculum, thus, revising the 122-unit curriculum prescribed in 1946 by the Office of Private Education, as well as the 134-unit curriculum prescribed in 1963. The law schools were also given the option to maintain a legal aid clinic as part of its law curriculum. It also prescribed the need for law schools to have relevant library resources. Applicants for a law course are required to comply with the specific requirements for admission by the Bureau of Higher Education and the Court.<br><br>Such was the state of the regulation of legal education until the enactment of R.A.

Except for the regulation and supervision of law schools which was to be undertaken by the LEB under R.A. No. 7662, the structure of DECS as embodied in E.O. No. 117 remained practically unchanged.<br><br>Due to the fact that R.A. No. 7662 was yet to be implemented with the organization of the LEB, the CHED, meanwhile, assumed the function of supervising and regulating law schools. For this purpose, the CHED constituted a Technical Panel for Legal Education which came up with a Revised Policies and Standards for Legal Education, which, however, was unpublished.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>3. </i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Legal education is a mere composite of the educational system</i></b></div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>As recounted, the historical development of statutes on education unerringly reflects the consistent exercise by the political departments of the power to supervise and regulate all levels and areas of education, including legal education.<br><br>Legal education is but a composite of the entire Philippine education system. It is perhaps unique because it is a specialized area of study. This peculiarity, however, is not reason in itself to demarcate legal education and withdraw it from the regulatory and supervisory powers of the political branches.<br><br>Notwithstanding, petitioners maintain that legal education, owing to its specialized "legal" nature and being preparatory to the practice of law, should fall within the regulation and supervision of the Court itself. Petitioners in G.R. No. 242954 went as far as professing that they are not against the creation of an administrative body that will supervise and regulate law schools, only that such body should be placed under the Court's supervision and control.<br><br>Two principal reasons militate against such proposition:<br><br><i>First</i>, it assumes that the Court, in fact, possesses the power to supervise and regulate legal education as a necessary consequence of its power to regulate the admission to the practice of law. This assumption, apart from being manifestly contrary to the above-recounted history of legal education in the Philippines, is likewise devoid of legal anchorage.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the Court exercises only judicial functions and it cannot, and must not, arrogate upon itself a power that is not constitutionally vested to it, lest the Court itself violates the doctrine of separation of powers. For the Court to void R.A. No. 7662 and thereafter, to form a body that regulates legal education and place it under its supervision and control, as what petitioners suggest, is to demonstrate a highly improper form of judicial activism.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>4.</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i> Court's exclusive rule-making power covers the practice of law and not the study of law</i></b></div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The Constitution lays down the powers which the Court can exercise.

The complexion of the rule-making power, however, changes with the promulgation of these organic laws.<br><br>Under the 1935 Constitution, existing laws on pleading, practice and procedure were repealed and were instead converted as the Rules of Court which the Court can alter and modify. The Congress, on the other hand, was given the power to repeal, alter or supplement the rules on pleading, practice and procedure, and the admission to the practice of law promulgated by the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup><br><br>This power to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure, and admission to the practice of law is in fact zealously guarded by the Court.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Philippine Lawyers Association v.

As observed in <i>Echegaray v.

In fact, the practice of law has a settled jurisprudential meaning:<br><blockquote>The practice of law is not limited to the conduct of cases or litigation in court; it embraces the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident to actions and social proceedings, the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts, and in addition, conveying. In general, all advice to clients, and all action taken for them in matters connected with the law corporation services, assessment and condemnation services contemplating an appearance before a judicial body, the foreclosure of a mortgage, enforcement of a creditor's claim in bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, and conducting proceedings in attachment, and in matters of estate and guardianship have been held to constitute law practice as the preparation and drafting of legal instruments, where the work done involves the determination by the trained legal mind of the legal effect of facts and conditions.<br><br>Practice of law under modern conditions consists in no small part of work performed outside of any court and having no immediate relation to proceedings in court. It embraces conveyancing, the giving of legal advice on a large variety of subjects, and the preparation and execution of legal instruments covering an extensive field of business and trust relations and other affairs. Although these transactions may have no direct connection with court proceedings, they are always subject to become involved in litigation. They require in many aspects a high degree of legal skill, a wide experience with men and affairs, and great capacity for adaptation to difficult and complex situations. These customary functions of an attorney or counselor at law bear an intimate relation to the administration of justice by the courts. No valid distinction, so far as concerns the question set forth in the order, can be drawn between that part of the work of the lawyer which involved appearance in court and that part which involves advice and drafting of instruments in his office. It is of importance to the welfare of the public that these manifold customary functions be performed by persons possessed of adequate learning and skill, of sound moral character, and acting at all times under the heavy trust obligations to clients which rests upon all attorneys.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> (Internal citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The definition of the practice of law, no matter how broad, cannot be further enlarged as to cover the study of law.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>5.</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>The Court exercises judicial power only</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Section 12, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution clearly provides that "[t]he Members of the Supreme Court and of other courts established by law shall not be designated to any agency performing quasi-judicial or administrative functions."

A power is residual if it does not belong to either of the two co-equal branches and which the remaining branch can, thus, exercise consistent with its functions. Regulation and supervision of legal education is primarily exercised by the Legislative and implemented by the Executive, thus, it cannot be claimed by the judiciary.<br><br>It is with studied restraint that the Court abstains from exercising a power that is not strictly judicial, or that which is not expressly granted to it by the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> This judicial abstention is neither avoidance nor dereliction - there is simply no basis for the Court to supervise and regulate legal education. <br><br>Court supervision over legal education is nevertheless urged<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> to the same extent as the Court administers, supervises and controls the Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> The parallelism is mislaid because the PHILJA is intended for judicial education.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> It particularly serves as the "training school for justices, judges, court personnel, lawyers and aspirants to judicial posts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> Court supervision over judicial education is but consistent with the Court's power of supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup><br><br>Still, petitioners insist that the Court actually regulated legal education through Sections 5, 6, and 16 of Rule 138 and Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Rule 138-A of the 1997 Rules of Court.

This section was amended by Bar Matter No. 1153,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> to require applicants to "successfully [complete] all the prescribed courses for the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent, in a law school or university officially recognized by the Philippine Government, or by the proper authority in foreign jurisdiction where the degree has been granted." Bar Matter No. 1153 further provides that a Filipino citizen who is a graduate of a foreign law school shall be allowed to take the bar examinations only upon the submission to the Court of the required certifications.<br><br>In addition to the core courses of civil law, commercial law, remedial law, criminal law, public and private international law, political law, labor and social legislation, medical jurisprudence, taxation, and legal ethics, Section 5 was further amended by <i>A.M. No. 19-03-24-SC or the Revised Law Student Practice Rule dated June 25, 2019</i> to include Clinical Legal Education as a core course that must be completed by an applicant to the bar examinations.<br><br>Notably, Section 5, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, as amended, is not directed to law schools, but to those who would like to take the bar examinations and enumerates the academic competencies required of them. The Court does not impose upon law schools what courses to teach, or the degree to grant, but prescribes only the core academic courses which it finds essential for an applicant to be admitted to the bar. Law schools enjoy the autonomy to teach or not to teach these courses. In fact, the Court even extends recognition to a degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent obtained abroad or that granted by a foreign law school for purposes of qualifying to take the Philippine Bar Examinations, subject only to the submission of the required certifications. Section 5 could not therefore be interpreted as an exercise of the Court's regulatory or supervisory power over legal education since, for obvious reasons, its reach could not have possibly be extended to legal education in foreign jurisdictions.<br><br>In similar fashion, Section 6, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court requires that an applicant to the bar examinations must have completed a four-year high school course and a bachelor's degree in arts or sciences. Again, this requirement is imposed upon the applicant to the bar examinations and not to law schools. These requirements are merely consistent with the nature of a law degree granted in the Philippines which is a professional, as well as a post-baccalaureate degree.<br><br>It is a reality that the Rules of Court, in prescribing the qualifications in order to take the bar examinations, had placed a considerable constraint on the courses offered by law schools. Adjustments in the curriculum, for instance, is a compromise which law schools apparently are willing to take in order to elevate its chances of graduating future bar examinees. It is in this regard that the relationship between legal education and admissions to the bar becomes unmistakable. This, however, does not mean that the Court has or exercises jurisdiction over legal education. Compliance by law schools with the prescribed core courses is but a recognition of the Court's exclusive jurisdiction over admissions to the practice of law - that no person shall be allowed to take the bar examinations and thereafter, be admitted to the Philippine Bar without having taken and completed the required core courses.<br><br>Section 16, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, on the other hand, provides that those who fail the bar examinations for three or more times must take a refresher course. Similarly, this is a requirement imposed upon the applicant. The Court does not impose that a law school should absolutely include in its curriculum a refresher course.<br><br><b><i>6(b). Revised Law Student Practice Rule</i></b><br><br>Neither does Rule 138-A of the Rules of Court as amended by A.M. No. 19-03-24-SC on law student practice manifest the Court's exercise of supervision or regulation over legal education. The three-fold rationale of the law student practice rule is as follows:<br><blockquote>1. [T]o ensure that there will be no miscarriage of justice as a result of incompetence or inexperience of law students, who, not having as yet passed the test of professional competence, are presumably not fully equipped to act [as] counsels on their own;<br><br>2. [T]o provide a mechanism by which the accredited law school clinic may be able to protect itself from any potential vicarious liability arising from some culpable action by their law students; and<br><br>3. [T]o ensure consistency with the fundamental principle that no person is allowed to practice a particular profession without possessing the qualifications, particularly a license, as required by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup><br></blockquote>Consistently, the Revised Law Student Practice Rule is primordially intended to ensure access to justice of the marginalized sectors and to regulate the law student practitioner's limited practice of law pursuant to the Court's power to promulgate rules on pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged.<br><br>In allowing the law student and in governing the conduct of the law student practitioner, what the Court regulates and supervises is not legal education, but the appearance and conduct of a law student before any trial court, tribunal, board, or officer, to represent indigent clients of the legal clinic - an activity rightfully falling under the definition of practice of law. Inasmuch as the law student is permitted to act for the legal clinic and thereby to practice law, it is but proper that the Court exercise regulation and supervision over the law student practitioner. Necessarily, the Court has the power to allow their appearance and plead their case, and hereafter, to regulate their actions.<br><br>In all, the Rules of Court do not support petitioners' argument that the Court regulates and supervises legal education. To reiterate, the Rules of Court are directed not towards legal education or law schools, but towards applicants for admission to the bar and applicants for admission to the bar examinations - consistent with the Court's power to promulgate rules concerning admission to the practice of law, the same being fundamentally a judicial function.<br><br>Having, thus, established that the regulation and supervision of legal education do not fall within the competence of the Court and is, instead, a power exercised by the political departments, the Court now proceeds to determine the extent of such police power in relation to legal education.<br><br><center><b>B.<br>Reasonable Supervision and Regulation of Legal <br>Education as an Exercise of Police Power</b><br></center><br>The term police power was first used<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> in jurisprudence in 1824 in <i>Gibbons v.

An express power is necessarily more extensive than a mere implied power. For instance, if there is conflict between an express individual right and the express power to control private education it cannot off-hand be said that the latter must yield to the former - conflict of two express powers. But if the power to control education is merely implied from the police power, it is feasible to uphold the express individual right[.] x x x<br></blockquote>The 1987 Constitution under Section 4(1), Article XIV, even when expressly recognizing the complementary roles played by the public and private schools in education, reiterated that these educational institutions are subject to State supervision and regulation, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4.(1) The State recognizes the complementary roles of <b>public and private institutions in the educational system</b> and shall <b>exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions</b>.

Rather, it belongs essentially and naturally to the parents,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> which right and duty they surrender by delegation to the educational institutions.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Obviating any inference that the power to regulate means the power to control, the 1987 Constitution added the word "reasonable" before the phrase supervision and regulation.<br><br>The import of the word "reasonable" was elaborated in <i>Council of Teachers</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x Section 4(1) was a provision added by the Framers to crystallize the State's recognition of the importance of the role that the private sector plays in the quality of the Philippine education system. Despite this recognition, the Framers added the second portion of Section 4[1] to emphasize that the State, in the exercise of its police power, still possesses the power of supervision over private schools. The Framers were explicit, however, that this supervision refers to <i>external governance</i>, as opposed to <i>internal governance</i> which was reserved to the respective school boards, thus:<br><blockquote>Madam President, Section 2(b) introduces four changes: one, the addition of the word "reasonable" before the phrase "supervision and regulation"; two, the addition of the word "quality" before the word "education"; three, the change of the wordings in the 1973 Constitution referring to a system of education, requiring the same to be relevant to the goals of national development, to the present expression of "relevant to the needs of the people and society"; and four, the explanation of the meaning of the expression "integrated system of education" by defining the same as the recognition and strengthening of the complementary roles of public and private educational institutions as separate but integral parts of the total Philippine educational system.<br><br><b>When we speak of State supervision and regulation, we refer to the external governance of educational institutions</b>, particularly private educational institutions as distinguished from the internal governance by their respective boards of directors or trustees and their administrative officials. Even without a provision on external governance, the State would still have the inherent right to regulate educational institutions through the exercise of its police power. We have thought it advisable to restate the supervisory and regulatory functions of the State provided in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions with the addition of the word "reasonable." We found it necessary to add the word "reasonable" because of an <i>obiter dictum</i> of our Supreme Court in a decision in the case of <i>Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities vs. The Secretary of Education and the Board of Textbooks</i> in 1955. In that case, the court said, and I quote:<br><blockquote>It is enough to point out that local educators and writers think the Constitution provides for control of education by the State.<br><br>The Solicitor General cites many authorities to show that the power to regulate means power to control, and quotes from the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention to prove that State control of private education was intended by organic law.<br></blockquote><b>The addition, therefore, of the word 'reasonable' is meant to underscore the sense of the committee, that when the Constitution speaks of State supervision and regulation, it does not in any way mean control.

The Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> elucidates how academic freedom is enjoyed by institutions of higher learning:<br><blockquote>[I]t is to be noted that the reference is to the "institutions of higher learning" as the recipients of this boon. It would follow then that the school or college itself is possessed of such a right. <b>It decides for itself its aims and objectives and how best to attain them. It is free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. It has a wide sphere of autonomy certainly extending to the choice of students.</b> This constitutional provision is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a grudging fashion. That would be to frustrate its purpose, nullify its intent. Former President Vicente G. Sinco of the University of the Philippines, in his Philippine Political Law, is similarly of the view that it "definitely grants the right of academic freedom to the university as an institution as distinguished from the academic freedom of a university professor." He cited the following from Dr. Marcel Bouchard, Rector of the University of Dijon, France, President of the conference of rectors and vice-chancellors of European universities: "It is a well-established fact, and yet one which sometimes tends to be obscured in discussions of the problems of freedom, that the collective liberty of an organization is by no means the same thing as the freedom of the individual members within it; in fact, the two kinds of freedom are not even necessarily connected. In considering the problems of academic freedom one must distinguish, therefore, between the autonomy of the university, as a corporate body, and the freedom of the individual university teacher." Also: To clarify further the distinction between the freedom of the university and that of the individual scholar, he says: The personal aspect of freedom consists in the right of each university teacher - recognized and effectively guaranteed by society - to seek and express the truth as he personally sees it, both in his academic work and in his capacity as a private citizen. Thus the status of the individual university teacher is at least as important, in considering academic freedom, as the status of the institutions to which they belong and through which they disseminate their learning.

This must necessarily be so since institutions of higher learning are not mere walls within which to teach; rather, it is a place where research, experiment, critical thinking, and exchanges are secured. Any form of State control, even at its most benign and disguised as regulatory, cannot therefore derogate the academic freedom guaranteed to higher educational institutions. In fact, this non-intrusive relation between the State and higher educational institutions is maintained even when the Constitution itself prescribes certain educational "thrusts" or directions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup><br><br>This attitude of non-interference is not lost in jurisprudence.

Right to education</i></b><br><br>Apart from the perspective of academic freedom, the reasonable supervision and regulation clause is also to be viewed together with the right to education. The 1987 Constitution speaks quite elaborately on the right to education. Section 1, Article XIV provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1. The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all.<br></blockquote>The normative elements of the general right to education under Section 1, Article XIV, are (1) to protect and promote quality education; and (2) to take appropriate steps towards making such quality education accessible.<br><br>"Quality" education is statutorily defined as the appropriateness, relevance and excellence of the education given to meet the needs and aspirations of the individual and society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup><br><br>In order to protect and promote quality education, the political departments are vested with the ample authority to set minimum standards to be met by all educational institutions. This authority should be exercised within the parameters of reasonable supervision and regulation. As elucidated in <i>Council of Teachers</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup><br><blockquote>While the Constitution indeed mandates the State to provide quality education, <b>the determination of what constitutes quality education is best left with the political departments who have the necessary knowledge, expertise, and resources to determine the same</b>. The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission again are very instructive:<br><blockquote>Now, Madam President, <b>we have added the word "quality" before "education" to send appropriate signals to the government that, <u>in the exercise of its supervisory and regulatory powers, it should first set satisfactory minimum requirements in all areas curriculum, faculty, internal administration, library, laboratory class and other facilities, et cetera, and it should see to it that satisfactory minimum requirements are met by all educational institutions, both public and private</u></b>.<br><br><u><b>When we speak of quality education we have in mind such matters, among others, as curriculum development, development of learning resources and instructional materials, upgrading of library and laboratory facilities, innovations in educational technology and teaching methodologies, improvement of research quality, and others.</b></u> Here and in many other provisions on education, the principal focus of attention and concern is the students. I would like to say that in my view there is a slogan when we speak of quality of education that I feel we should be aware of, which is, "Better than ever is not enough." In other words, even if the quality of education is good now, we should attempt to keep on improving it. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>On the other hand, "accessible" education means equal opportunities to education regardless of social and economic differences. The phrase "shall take appropriate steps" signifies that the State may adopt varied approaches in the delivery of education that are relevant and responsive to the needs of the people and the society. This is why, towards this end, the State shall:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Establish, maintain, and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of <strong>education relevant to the needs of the people and society</strong>;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Establish and maintain a system of <strong>free public education in the elementary and high school levels</strong>.

GASCON: When we speak of education as a right, what we would like to emphasize is that <b>education should be equally accessible to all regardless of social and economic differences.

And recognizing the limits of our financial resources, tertiary education should still be afforded and provided availability to those who are poor and deserving</b>. That is why when we say that education is a right, it imposes a correlative duty on the part of the State to provide it to the citizens. Making it a right shows that education is recognized as an important function of the State. Education is not merely a social service to be provided by the State. The proposed provision recognizes that a right to education is a right to acquire a decent standard of living, and that, therefore, the State cannot deprive anyone of this right in the same manner that the right to life, the right to liberty and property cannot be taken away without due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The element of accessibility under the Constitution, thus, pertains to both the elimination of discrimination especially against disadvantaged groups and to the financial duty of the State for, after all, the right to education is part and parcel of social justice. The objective is to make quality education accessible by appropriate means.<br><br>Apart from the Constitution, the right to education is also recognized in international human rights law under various instruments to which the Philippines is a state signatory and to which it is concomitantly bound.<br><br>For instance, Article 13(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup> of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognizes the right to receive an education with the following interrelated and essential features; (a) availability; (b) accessibility; (c) acceptability; and (d) adaptability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup><br><br>In particular, accessibility is understood as giving everyone, without discrimination, access to educational institutions and programs.

Judge Capulong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><blockquote>Since <i>Garcia v.

While under the Education Act of 1982, students have a right "to freely choose their field of study, subject to existing curricula and to continue their course therein up to graduation," such right is subject, as all rights are, to the established academic and disciplinary standards laid down by the academic institution.</b><br><br>"For private schools have the right to establish reasonable rules and regulations for the admission, discipline and promotion of students.

Going a step further, the establishment of rules governing university-student relations, particularly those pertaining to student discipline, may be regarded as vital, not merely to the smooth and efficient operation of the institution, but to its very survival.<br><br>Within memory of the current generation is the eruption of militancy in the academic groves as collectively, the students demanded and plucked for themselves from the panoply of academic freedom their own rights encapsulized under the rubric of "right to education" forgetting that, in Hohfeldian terms, they have a concomitant duty, and that is, their <b>duty to learn under the rules laid down by the school</b>. (Citation in the original omitted; emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Villar v. Technological Institute of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup> the Court similarly held:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>2. What cannot be stressed too sufficiently is that among the most important social, economic, and cultural rights is the right to education not only in the elementary and high school grades but also on the college level. The constitutional provision as to the State maintaining "a system of free public elementary education and, in areas where finances permit, establish and maintain a system of free public education" up to the high school level does not <i>per se</i> exclude the exercise of that right in colleges and universities. It is only at the most a reflection of the lack of sufficient funds for such a duty to be obligatory in the case of students in the colleges and universities. <b>As far as the right itself is concerned, not the effectiveness of the exercise of such right because of the lack of funds, Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides: "Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit."</b><br><br>3. It is quite clear that <b>while the right to college education is included in the social economic, and cultural rights, it is equally manifest that the obligation imposed on the State is not categorical, the phrase used being "generally available" and higher education, while being "equally accessible to all should be on the basis of merit." To that extent, therefore, there is justification for excluding three of the aforementioned petitioners because of their marked academic deficiency.</b><br><br>4. <b>The academic freedom enjoyed by "institutions of higher learning" includes the right to set academic standards to determine under what circumstances failing grades suffice for the expulsion of students.</b> Once it has done so, however, that standard should be followed meticulously. It cannot be utilized to discriminate against those students who exercise their constitutional rights to peaceable assembly and free speech. If it does so, then there is a legitimate grievance by the students thus prejudiced, their right to the equal protection clause being disregarded.

In <i>Department of Education, Culture and Sports v. San Diego</i>, we held that the right to education is not absolute. Section 5(e), Article XIV of the Constitution provides that "[e]very citizen has a right to select a profession or course of study, subject to fair, reasonable, and equitable admission and academic requirements." <b>The thesis requirement and the compliance with the procedures leading to it, are part of the reasonable academic requirements a person desiring to complete a course of study would have to comply with.</b> (Citation in the original omitted; emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The deliberations of the framers on the qualifications to the right to education are also illuminating:<br><blockquote>MR. NOLLEDO: Thank you, Madam President. Before I ask questions directed to the chairman and members of the committee, I would like to warmly congratulate them for a job well-done. The committee report to my mind, Madam President, is excellent and I hope it will not, in the course of amendments, suffer from adulteration. With respect to page 1, lines 12-13: "Education is the right of every citizen of the Philippines," I agree with this statement, but when we talk of the right, I understand from the chairman that it is compellable and from Commissioner Guingona, that it is enforceable in court. <b>Suppose a student of a private school is not allowed to enroll by reason of misconduct or that his stay in the school is considered by the administration of that school to be undesirable, does he have a right to enforce his right to education under this situation?</b><br><br>MR. GUINGONA: Madam President, <b>the right to education, like any other right, is not absolute</b>. As a matter of fact, Article XXVI of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, when it acknowledges the right to education, also qualifies it when at the end of the provision, it say, "on the basis of merit." Therefore, <b>the student may be subject to certain reasonable requirements regarding admission and retention</b> and this is so provided in the draft Constitution. We admit even of discrimination. We have accepted this in the Philippines, and I suppose in the United States <b>there are schools that can refuse admission to boys because they are supposed to be exclusively for girls.

No. 7662, <i>i.e.</i>, improvement of the quality of legal education, and, instead delves into the training of those who are already members of the bar. Likewise, this objective is a direct encroachment on the power of the Court to promulgate rules concerning the practice of law and legal assistance to the underprivileged and should, thus, be voided on this ground. As aptly observed by the CLEBM and which the Court had approved:<br><blockquote>In the same vein Section 3 provides as one of the objectives of legal education increasing "awareness among members of the legal profession of the needs of the poor, deprived and oppressed sectors of the society." Such objective should not find a place in the law that primarily aims to upgrade the standard of schools of law as they perform the task of educating aspiring lawyers. Section 5, paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the Constitution also provides that the Supreme Court shall have the power to promulgate rules on "legal assistance to the underprivileged" and hence, implementation of [R.A.

For this purpose, the Board shall prescribe the necessary guidelines for such accreditation and the specifications of such internship which shall include the actual work of a new member of the Bar[.]<br></blockquote>It is clear from the plain text of Section 7(g) that another requirement, <i>i.e.</i>, completion of a law internship program, is imposed by law for taking the bar examinations. This requirement unduly interferes with the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court to promulgate rules concerning the practice of law and admissions thereto.<br><br>The jurisdiction to determine whether an applicant may be allowed to take the bar examinations belongs to the Court. In fact, under the <i>whereas</i> clauses of the Revised Law Student Practice Rule, the Court now requires the completion of clinical legal education courses, which may be undertaken <i>either</i> in a law clinic or through an externship, as a prerequisite to take the bar examinations, thus:<br><blockquote><i>Whereas</i>, to produce practice-ready lawyers, the completion of clinical legal education courses must be a prerequisite to take the bar examinations as provided in Section 5 of Rule 138.<br></blockquote>Under Section 7(g), the power of the LEB is no longer confined within the parameters of legal education, but now dabbles on the requisites for admissions to the bar examinations, and consequently, admissions to the bar. This is a direct encroachment upon the Court's exclusive authority to promulgate rules concerning admissions to the bar and should, therefore, be struck down as unconstitutional.<br><br>Further, and as will be discussed hereunder, the LEB exercised this power in a manner that forces upon law schools the establishment of a legal apprenticeship program or a legal aid clinic, in violation of the schools' right to determine for themselves their respective curricula.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>3.</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Section 2, par. 2 and Section 7(h) on continuing legal education of practicing lawyers</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Petitioners in G.R.

Inasmuch as the LEB is authorized to compel <i>mandatory attendance of practicing lawyers</i> in such courses and for such duration <i>as the LEB deems, necessary</i>, the same encroaches upon the Court's power to promulgate rules concerning the Integrated Bar which includes the education of "lawyer-professors" as teaching of law is practice of law. The mandatory continuing legal education of the members of the bar is, in fact, covered by B.M. No. 850 or the Rules on Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) dated August 22, 2000 which requires members of the bar, not otherwise exempt, from completing, every three years, at least 36 hours of continuing legal education activities approved by the MCLE Committee directly supervised by the Court.<br><br>As noted by the CLEBM:<br><blockquote>Thus, under the declaration of policies in Section 2 of [R.A. No. 7662], the State "shall undertake appropriate reforms in the legal education system, require the proper selection of law students, maintain quality among law schools and require apprenticeship and continuing legal education["]. The concept of continuing legal education encompasses education not only of law students but also of members of the legal profession. Its inclusion in the declaration of policies implies that the [LEB] shall have jurisdiction over the education of persons who have finished the law course and are already licensed to practice law. <u>Viewed in the light of Section 5, paragraph 5 of Article VIII of the Constitution that vests the Supreme Court with powers over the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, said portion of Section 2 of [R.A.

No. 7662 which gives the LEB the power to prescribe the minimum standards for law admission is allegedly unconstitutional as it violates the doctrine of separation of powers. Necessarily, according to the petitioners, the PhiLSAT which was imposed by the LEB pursuant to Section 7(e) of R.A. No. 7662 is likewise void.<br><br>The Court finds no constitutional conflict between its rule-making power and the power of the LEB to prescribe the minimum standards for law admission under Section 7(e) of R.A.

No. 7662 to prescribe the minimum standards for law admission should be read with the State policy behind the enactment of R.A. No. 7662 which is fundamentally to uplift the standards of legal education and the law's thrust to undertake reforms in the legal education system. Construing the LEH's power to prescribe the standards for law admission together with the LEB's other powers to administer, supervise, and accredit law schools, leads to the logical interpretation that the law circumscribes the LEB's power to prescribe admission requirements only to those seeking enrollment to a school or college of law and not to the practice of law.<br><br>Reference may also be made to DECS Order No. 27-1989, as the immediate precursor of R.A. No. 7662, as to what is sought to be regulated when the law speaks of "law admission" requirements.<br><br>Section 1, Article VIII of DECS Order No. 27-1989 is clear that the admission requirement pertains to enrollment in a law course, or law school, or legal education, thus:<br><blockquote><center>Article VIII<br><b>Admission</b>, Residence and Other <b>Requirements</b><br></center><br>SEC. 1. <b>No applicant shall be enrolled in the law course unless he complies with specific requirements for admission by the Bureau of Higher Education and the Supreme Court of the Philippines</b>, for which purpose he must present to the registrar the necessary credentials before the end of the enrollment period.

Further support is nevertheless offered by the exchanges during the Senate interpellations, wherein it was assumed that the phrase "minimum standards for law admission" refers to the requirements that the student must fulfill before being admitted to law school. This assumption was not corrected by the bill's sponsor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>4(b). </i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Section 7(e) of R.A.

It merely authorizes the LEB to prescribe minimum requirements not amounting to control.<br><br>Emphatically, the law allows the LEB to prescribe only the minimum standards and it did not, in any way, impose that the minimum standard for law admission should be by way of an exclusionary and qualifying exam nor did it prevent law schools from imposing their respective admission requirements.<br><br>Thus, under LEBMO No. 1-2011, the minimum standards for admission to law schools as implemented by the LEB are: (1) completion of a four-year high school course; and (2) completion of a course for a bachelor's degree in arts or sciences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> Again, these requirements are but consistent with the nature of the law course in the Philippines as being both a professional and post-baccalaureate education.<br><br>As the facts disclose, however, the LEB later on introduced the PhiLSAT as an additional prerequisite for admission to law school.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>4(c).</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Pursuant to Section 7(e), LEB is authorized to administer an aptitude test as a minimum standard for law admission</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Evident from the Senate deliberations that, in prescribing the minimum standards for law admission, <i>an aptitude test may be administered by the LEB</i> although such is not made mandatory under the law. Thus:<br><blockquote>Senator Tolentino: x x x<br><br>I will proceed to another point, Mr. President. I have taught law for more than 25 years in private schools and in the University of the Philippines as well. There is one thing I have noticed in all these years of teaching and that is, many students in the law school are not prepared or apt by inclination or by ability to become lawyers. I see that the objectives of the legal education that are provided for in this bill do not provide for some mechanism of choosing people who should take up the law course.<br><br>As it is now, because of our democratic principles, anybody who wants to become a lawyer, who can afford the tuition fee, or who has the required preparatory course, can be admitted into the law school. And yet, while studying law, many of these students - I would say there are about 30 or 40 percent of students in private schools - should not be taking up law but some other course because, simply, they do not have the inclination, they do not have the aptitude or the ability to become lawyers.<br><br>Can that be provided for in this bill, Madam Sponsor? Would it contravene really our principles of democracy where everybody should be free to take the course that he wants to take? Or should the State be able to determine who should be able or who should be allowed to take a particular course, in this case of law?<br><br>Senator Shahani: <b>Mr. President, there are those aptitude tests which are being taken when the student is in high school to somehow guide the guidance councilors [sic] into the aptitude of the students. But the talent or the penchant for the legal profession is not one of those subjects specifically measured. I think what is measured really is who is, more or less, talented for an academic education as against a vocational education. But maybe, a new test will have to be designed to really test the aptitude of those who would like to enter the law school.</b> x x x<br><br>Senator Tolentino: x x x<br><br>Many parents want to see their children become lawyers. But they do not consider the aptitude of these children, and they waste money and time in making these children take up law when they really are not suited to the law course. <b>My real concern is whether by legislation, we can provide for selection of those who should be allowed to take up law, and not everybody would be allowed to take up law.</b> x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Senator Shahani: <b>Mr. President, of course, the right to education is a constitutional right, and I think one cannot just categorically deny a student - especially if he is bright - entrance to a law school.

I think [Senator Shahani] has already answered that, <u><b>that the [LEB] may prescribe an aptitude test for that purpose.

Petitioners argue that the PhiLSAT is unreasonable because: it is not a conclusive proof of the student's aptitude;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> it entails unreasonable examination and travel expenses and burdensome documentary requirements;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> applying for PhiLSAT exemption is inconvenient;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> it is redundant to existing law school entrance exams;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> and it is not supported by scientific study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, these grounds are not only conclusions of fact which beg the presentation of competent evidence, but also necessarily go into the wisdom of the PhiLSAT which the Court cannot inquire into.

The Court does not agree.<br><br>The subject of the PhiLSAT is to improve the quality of legal education. It is indubitable that the State has an interest in prescribing regulations promoting education and thereby protecting the common good. Improvement of the quality of legal education, thus, falls squarely within the scope of police power. The PhiLSAT, as an aptitude test, was the means to protect this interest.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>4(e). </i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Tablarin sustained the conduct of an admission test as a legitimate exercise of the State's regulatory power</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Moreover, by case law, the Court already upheld the validity of administering an aptitude test as a reasonable police power measure in the context of admission standards into institutions of higher learning.<br><br>In <i>Tablarin</i>, the Court upheld not only the constitutionality of Section 5(a) of R.A. No. 2382, or the Medical Act of 1959, which gave the Board of Medical Education (BME) the power to prescribe requirements for admission to medical schools, but also <i>MECS Order No. 52, Series of 1985</i> (MECS Order No. 52-1985) issued by the BME which prescribed NMAT.<br><br>Using the rational basis test, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the NMAT as follows:<br><blockquote>Perhaps the only issue that needs some consideration is <b>whether there is some reasonable relation between the prescribing of passing the NMAT as a condition for admission to medical school on the one hand, and the securing of the health and safety of the general community, on the other hand</b>. This question is perhaps most usefully approached by recalling that the <b>regulation of the practice of medicine in all its branches has long been recognized as a reasonable method of protecting the health and safety of the public</b>. That the power to regulate and control the practice of medicine includes the power to regulate admission to the ranks of those authorized to practice medicine, is also well recognized. Thus, legislation and administrative regulations requiring those who wish to practice medicine first to take and pass medical board examinations have long ago been recognized as valid exercises of governmental power. Similarly, the establishment of minimum medical educational requirements - i.e., the completion of prescribed courses in a recognized medical school - for admission to the medical profession, has also been sustained as a legitimate exercise of the regulatory authority of the state. <b>What we have before us in the instant case is closely related; the regulation of access to medical schools.</b> MECS Order No. 52, s. 1985, as noted earlier, articulates the rationale of regulation of this type: the improvement of the professional and technical quality of the graduates of medical schools, by upgrading the quality of those admitted to the student body of the medical schools. <b>That upgrading is sought by selectivity in the process of admission, selectivity consisting, among other things, of limiting admission to those who exhibit in the required degree the aptitude for medical studies and eventually for medical practice.</b> The need to maintain, and the difficulties of maintaining, high standards in our professional schools in general, and medical schools in particular, in the current stage of our social and economic development, are widely known.<br><br><b>We believe that the government is entitled to prescribe an admission test like the NMAT as a means for achieving its stated objective of "upgrading the selection of applicants into [our] medical schools" and of "improv[ing] the quality of medical education, in the country."</b> Given the widespread use today of such admission tests in, for instance, medical schools in the United States of America the Medical College Admission Test [MCAT] and quite probably in other countries with far more developed educational resources than our own, and taking into account the failure or inability of the petitioners to even attempt to prove otherwise, <b>we are entitled to hold that the NMAT is reasonably related to the securing of the ultimate end of legislation and regulation in this area. That end, it is useful to recall, is the protection of the public from the potentially deadly effects of incompetence and ignorance in those who would undertake to treat our bodies and minds for disease or trauma</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court reached its conclusion that NMAT is a valid exercise of police power because the method employed, <i>i.e.</i>, regulation of admissions to medical education is reasonably related to the subject, <i>i.e.</i>, the protection of the public by ensuring that only those qualified are eventually allowed to practice medicine.<br><br>The necessity of State intervention to ensure that the medical profession is not infiltrated by those unqualified to take care of the life and health of patients was likewise the reason why the Court in <i>Department of Education, Culture and Sports v. San Diego</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> upheld the "three-flunk" rule in NMAT:<br><blockquote>We see no reason why the rationale in the [<i>TabIarin</i>] case cannot apply to the case at bar. The issue raised in both cases is the academic preparation of the applicant. This may be gauged at least initially by the admission test and, indeed with more reliability, by the three-flunk rule. <b>The latter cannot be regarded any less valid than the former in the regulation of the medical profession.</b><br><br>There is no need to redefine here the police power of the State. Suffice it to repeat that the power is validly exercised if (a) the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require the interference of the State, and (b) the means employed are reasonably necessary to the attainment of the object sought to be accomplished and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.<br><br>In other words, the proper exercise of the police power requires the concurrence of a lawful subject and a lawful method.<br><br><b>The subject of the challenged regulation is certainly within the ambit of the police power. It is the right and indeed the responsibility of the State to insure that the medical profession is not infiltrated by incompetents to whom patients may unwarily entrust their lives and health.</b><br><br><b>The method employed by the challenged regulation is not irrelevant to the purpose of the law nor is it arbitrary or oppressive. The three-flunk rule is intended to insulate the medical schools and ultimately the medical profession from the intrusion of those not qualified to be doctors.</b> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><i>Tablarin</i> recognized that State intervention was necessary, and therefore was allowed, because of the need to meet the goal of promoting public health and safety.<br><br>In similar vein, the avowed purpose of the PhiLSAT is to improve the quality of legal education by evaluating and screening applicants to law school. As elucidated, the State has an interest in improving the quality of legal education for the protection of the community at-large, and requiring an entrance test is reasonably related to that interest. In other words, the State has the power and the prerogative to impose a standardized test prior to entering law school, in the same manner and extent that the State can do so in medical school when it prescribed the NMAT.<br><br>In all, the Court finds no constitutional conflict between the Court's rule-making power concerning admissions to the practice of law and on the LEB's power to prescribe minimum standards for law admission under Section 7(e) of R.A. No. 7662.<br><br>Further, pursuant to its power under Section 7(e), the Court affirms the LEB's authority to initiate and administer an aptitude test, such as the PhiLSAT, as a minimum standard for law admission. Thus, the PhiLSAT, insofar as it functions as an aptitude exam that measures the academic potential of the examinee to pursue the study of law to the end that the quality of legal education is improved is not <i>per se</i> unconstitutional.<br><br>However, there are certain provisions of the PhiLSAT that render its operation exclusionary, restrictive, and qualifying which is contrary to its design as an aptitude exam meant to be used as a tool that should only help and guide law schools in gauging the aptness of its applicants for the study of law. These provisions effectively and absolutely exclude applicants who failed to pass the PhiLSAT from taking up a course in legal education, thereby restricting and qualifying admissions to law schools. As will be demonstrated, these provisions of the PhiLSAT are unconstitutional for being manifestly violative of the law schools' exercise of academic freedom, specifically the autonomy to determine for itself who it shall allow to be admitted to its law program.<br><br><center><b>D.<br>LEB's Powers <i>vis-a-vis</i> Institutional Academic <br>Freedom and the Right to Education</b><br></center>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>1. </i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>&nbsp; </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>PhiLSAT</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Paragraphs 7, 9, 11, and 15 of LEBMO No. 7-2016, provide:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>7.

In mandating that only applicants who scored at least 55% correct answers shall be admitted to any law school, the PhiLSAT actually usurps the right and duty of the law school to determine for itself the criteria for the admission of students and thereafter, to apply such criteria on a case-by-case basis. It also mandates law schools to absolutely reject applicants with a grade lower than the prescribed cut-off score and those with expired PhiLSAT eligibility. The token regard for institutional academic freedom comes into play, if at all, only after the applicants had been "pre-selected" without the school's participation. The right of the institutions then are constricted only in providing "additional" admission requirements, admitting of the interpretation that the preference of the school itself is merely secondary or supplemental to that of the State which is antithetical to the very principle of reasonable supervision and regulation.<br><br>The law schools are left with absolutely no discretion to choose its students at the first instance and in accordance with its own policies, but are dictated to surrender such discretion in favor of a State-determined pool of applicants, under pain of administrative sanctions and/or payment of fines. Mandating law schools to reject applicants who failed to reach the prescribed PhiLSAT passing score or those with expired PhiLSAT eligibility transfers complete control over admission policies from the law schools to the LEB. As Garcia tritely emphasized: "[c]olleges and universities should [not] be looked upon as public utilities devoid of any discretion as to whom to admit or reject. Education, especially higher education, belongs to a different, and certainly higher category."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>1(a).</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Comparison of PhiLSAT with NMAT and LSAT</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Respondent urges the Court to treat the PhiLSAT in the same manner that the Court treated the NMAT in <i>Tablarin</i>. Petitioners oppose on the ground that the PhiLSAT and the NMAT are different because there is a Constitutional body, <i>i.e.</i>, the Court, tasked to regulate the practice of law while there is none with respect to the practice of medicine.<br><br>The Court treats the PhiLSAT differently from the NMAT for the fundamental reason that these aptitude exams operate differently.<br><br>For one, how these exams allow the schools to treat the scores therein obtained is different.<br><br>While both exams seem to prescribe a "cut-off" score, the NMAT score is evaluated by the medical schools in relation to their own cut-off scores. Unlike the PhiLSAT score, the NMAT score is not the sole determining factor on whether or not an examinee may be admitted to medical school. The NMAT score is only meant to be one of the bases for evaluating applicants for admission to a college of medicine.<br><br>Medical schools further enjoy the discretion to determine how much weight should be assigned to an NMAT score relative to the schools' own admissions policy. Different medical schools may therefore set varying acceptable NMAT scores. Different medical schools may likewise assign different values to the NMAT score. This allows medical schools to consider the NMAT score <i>along with</i> the other credentials of the applicant. The NMAT score does not constrain medical schools to accept pre-selected applicants; it merely provides for a tool to evaluate all applicants.<br><br>Obtaining a low NMAT percentile score will not immediately and absolutely disqualify an applicant from being admitted to medical school. Obtaining a high NMAT percentile score only increases an applicant's options for medical schools. Taking the NMAT, thus, expands the applicant's options for medical schools; it does not limit them.<br><br>For another, medical schools are not subjected to sanctions in case they decide to admit an applicant pursuant to their own admissions policy. In fact, at some point,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> there was even no prescribed cut-off percentile score for the NMAT, and instead it was stressed that a student may enroll in any school, college or university upon meeting the latter's specific requirements and reasonable regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> Also, the issuance of a certificate of eligibility for admission to a college of medicine had been transferred to. the medical schools, thus, rightfully giving the responsibility for and accountability of determining eligibility of students for admission to the medical program to the schools concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup><br><br>Similar to the NMAT, the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is only one of the several criteria for evaluation for law school admission. It is just one of the methods that law schools may use to differentiate applicants for law school. The American Bar Association actually allows a law school to use an admission test other than the LSAT and it does not dictate the particular weight that a law school should give to the results of the LSAT in deciding whether to admit an applicant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup><br><br>In contrast, the PhiLSAT score itself determines whether an applicant may be admitted to law school or not, the PhiLSAT being strictly a pass or fail exam. It excludes those who failed to reach the prescribed cut-off score from being admitted to any law school. It qualifies admission to law school not otherwise imposed by the schools themselves. The PhiLSAT, as presently crafted, employs a totalitarian scheme in terms of student admissions. This leaves the consequent actions of the applicant-student and the school solely dependent upon the results of the PhiLSAT.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>1(b).</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Balancing State interest with institutional academic freedom</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Thus far, it is settled that the PhiLSAT, when administered as an aptitude test, is reasonably related to the State's unimpeachable interest in improving the quality of legal education. This aptitude test, however, should not be exclusionary, restrictive, or qualifying as to encroach upon institutional academic freedom. Moreover, in the exercise of their academic freedom to choose who to admit, the law schools should be left with the discretion to determine for themselves how much weight should the results of the PhiLSAT carry in relation to their individual admission policies. At all times, it is understood that the school's exercise of such academic discretion should not be gravely abused, arbitrary, whimsical, or discriminatory.<br><br>With the conclusion that the PhiLSAT, when administered as an aptitude test, passes the test of reasonableness, there is no reason to strike down the PhiLSAT in its entirety. Instead, the Court takes a calibrated approach and partially nullifies LEBMO No. 7-2016 insofar as it absolutely prescribes the passing of the PhiLSAT and the taking thereof within two years as a prerequisite for admission to any law school which, on its face, run directly counter to institutional academic freedom. The rest of LEBMO No. 7-2016, being free from any taint of unconstitutionality, should remain in force and effect, especially in view of the separability clause<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup> therein contained.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>1(c).</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>PhiLSAT and the right to education</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Anent the argument that the PhiLSAT transgresses petitioners' right to education and their right to select a profession or course of study, suffice to state that the PhiLSAT is a minimum admission standard that is rationally related to the interest of the State to improve the quality of legal education and, accordingly, to protect the general community. The constitutionality of the PhiLSAT, therefore, cannot be voided on the ground that it violates the right to education as stated under Section 1, Article XIV of the Constitution. The Court's pronouncement in <i>Tablarin</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup> again resonates with significance:<br><blockquote>Turning to Article XIV, Section 1, of the 1987 Constitution, we note that once more, petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the statute and regulation they assail in fact clash with that provision. On the contrary, we may note - x x x - that the statute and the regulation which petitioners attack are in fact designed to promote "quality education" at the level of professional schools. When one reads Section 1 in relation to Section 5(3) of Article XIV, as one must, one cannot but note that the latter phrase of Section 1 is not to be read with absolute literalness. The State is not really enjoined to take appropriate steps to make quality education "accessible to all" who might for any number of reasons wish to enroll in a professional school, but rather merely to make such education accessible to all who qualify under "fair, reasonable and equitable admission and academic requirements." </blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>2.</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Other LEB issuances on law admission</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Apart from the PhiLSAT, the LEB also imposed additional requirements for admission to law schools under LEBMO No. 1-2011, specifically:<br><blockquote><center>Article III<br>Prerequisites and Program Specification<br></center><br>SEC. 15. <i>Prerequisites to admission to Law School</i>. - x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Where the applicant for admission into a law school is a graduate of a foreign institution or school following a different course and progression of studies, <b>the matter shall be referred to the Board that shall determine the eligibility of the candidate for admission to law school</b>.<br><br>SEC. 16. <i>Board Prerequisites for Admission to the Ll.B. or J.D.

With regard to foreign students, a law school is completely bereft of the right to determine for itself whether to accept such foreign student or not, as the determination thereof now belongs to the LEB.<br><br>Similarly, the requirement that an applicant obtain a specific number of units in English, Mathematics, and Social Science subjects affects a law school's admission policies leaving the latter totally without discretion to admit applicants who are deficient in these subjects or to allow such applicant to complete these requirements at a later time. This requirement also effectively extends the jurisdiction of the LEB to the courses and units to be taken by the applicant in his or her pre-law course. Moreover, such requirement is not to be found under Section 6, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court as this section simply requires only the following from an applicant to the bar exams:<br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Pre-Law</i>. - No applicant for admission to the bar examination shall be admitted unless he presents a certificate that he has satisfied the Secretary of Education that, before he began the study of law, he had pursued and satisfactorily completed in an authorized and recognized university or college, requiring for admission thereto the completion of a four-year high school course, <b>the course of study prescribed therein for a bachelor's degree in arts or sciences with any of the following subjects as major or field of concentration: political science, logic, english, spanish, history and economics</b>.<br></blockquote>Likewise, in imposing that only those with a basic degree in law may be admitted to graduate programs in law encroaches upon the law school's right to determine who may be admitted. For instance, this requirement effectively nullifies the option of admitting non-law graduates on the basis of relevant professional experience that a law school, pursuant to its own admissions policy, may otherwise have considered.<br><br>The required general weighted average in the college course suffers the same infirmity and would have been struck down had ·it not been expressly repealed by the LEB because of the PhiLSAT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><em><strong>3.</strong></em></div></td><td width="20%" valign="top"><div align="justify"><em><strong> Section 7(c) and 7(e) on the minimum qualifications of faculty members</strong></em></div></td><td width="75%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The LEB is also empowered under Section 7(c) to set the standards of accreditation taking into account, among others, the "qualifications of the members of the faculty" and under Section 7(e) of R.A.

This much was affirmed by the Court when it approved the CLEBM's proposal to revise the powers of LEB under R.A.

They may be required to take an examination or to possess postgraduate degrees as prerequisite to employment.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This was reiterated in <i>Son v. University of Santo Tomas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[282]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>As early as in 1992, the requirement of a Master's degree in the undergraduate program professor's field of instruction has been in place, through DECS Order 92 (series of 1992, August 10, 1992) or the Revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools. Article IX, Section 44, paragraph [1(a)] thereof provides that college faculty members must have a master's degree in their field of instruction as a minimum qualification for teaching in a private educational institution and acquiring regular status therein.<br><br>DECS Order 92, Series of 1992 was promulgated by the DECS in the exercise of its [rule]-making power as provided for under Section 70 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 232, otherwise known as the Education Act of 1982. As such, it has the force and effect of law. In <i>University of the East v. Pepanio</i>, the requirement of a masteral degree for tertiary education teachers was held to be not unreasonable but rather in accord with the public interest.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>From a strict legal viewpoint, the parties are both in violation of the law: respondents, for maintaining professors without the mandated masteral degrees, and for petitioners, agreeing to be employed despite knowledge of their lack of the necessary qualifications. Petitioners cannot therefore insist to be employed by UST since they still do not possess the required master's degrees; the fact that UST continues to hire and maintain professors without the necessary master's degrees is not a ground for claiming illegal dismissal, or even reinstatement. As far as the law is concerned, respondents are in violation of the CHED regulations for continuing the practice of hiring unqualified teaching personnel; but the law cannot come to the aid of petitioners on this sole ground. As between the parties herein, they are in <i>pari delicto</i>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The minimum requirement of a master's degree in the undergraduate teacher's field of instruction has been cemented in DECS Order 92, Series of 1992. Both petitioners and respondents have been violating it. The fact that government has not cracked down on violators, or that it chose not to strictly implement the provision, does not erase the violations committed by erring educational institutions, including the parties herein; it simply means that government will not punish these violations for the meantime. The parties cannot escape its concomitant effects, nonetheless. And if respondents knew the overwhelming importance of the said provision and the public interest involved - as they now fiercely advocate to their favor - they should have complied with the same as soon as it was promulgated.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><br>In addition, the Court already held in <i>Herrera-Manaoisi v.

Private educational institutions must still supplementarily refer to the prevailing standards, qualifications, and conditions set by the appropriate government agencies (presently the Department of Education, the Commission on Higher Education, and the Teclmical Education and Skills Development Authority). This limitation on the right of private schools, colleges, and universities to select and determine the employment status of their academic personnel has been imposed by the state in view of the public interest nature of educational institutions, so as to ensure the quality and competency of our schools and educators.

However, it is the manner by which the LEB had exercised this power through its various issuances that prove to be unreasonable.<br><br>On this point, the <i>amicus curiae</i>, Dean Sedfrey M. Candelaria, while admitting that the masteral degree requirement is a "laudable aim" of the LEB, nevertheless adds that the LEB-imposed period of compliance is unreasonable given the logistical and financial obstacles:<br><blockquote>The masteral degree requirement is a laudable aim of LEB, but the possibility of meeting the LEB period of compliance is unreasonable and unrealistic in the light of logistical and financial considerations confronting the deans and professors, including the few law schools offering graduate degrees in law.<br><br>To illustrate, to the best of my knowledge there are no more than six (6) graduate schools of law around the country to service potential applicants. Those who have opted for graduate studies in law find it very costly to fly to the venue. While one or two programs may have been delivered outside the provider's home school venue to reach out to graduate students outside the urban centers, pedagogical standards are often compromised in the conduct of the modules. This is even aggravated by the fact that very few applicants can afford to go into full-time graduate studies considering that most deans and professors of law are in law practice. Perhaps, LEB should work in consultation with PALS in designing a cost-effective but efficient delivery system of any graduate program in law, [especially] for deans and law professors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[283]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, the mandatory character of the master of laws degree requirement, under pain of downgrading, phase-out and closure of the law school, is in sharp contrast with the previous requirement under DECS Order No. 27-1989 which merely <i>prefer</i> faculty members who are holders of a graduate law degree, or its equivalent. The LEB's authority to review the strength or weakness of the faculty on the basis of experience or length of time devoted to teaching violates an institution's right to set its own faculty standards. The LEB also imposed strict reportorial requirements that infringe on the institution's right to select its teachers which, for instance, may be based on expertise even with little teaching experience. Moreover, in case a faculty member seeks to be exempted, he or she must prove to the LEB, and not to the concerned institution, that he or she is an expert in the field, thus, usurping the freedom of the institution to evaluate the qualifications of its own teachers on an individual basis.<br><br>Also, while the LEB requires of faculty members and deans to obtain a master of laws degree before they are allowed to teach and administer a law school, respectively, it is ironic that the LEB, under <i>Resolution No. 2019-406</i>, in fact considers the basic law degrees of Ll.B. or J.D. as already equivalent to a doctorate degree in other non-law academic disciplines for purposes of "appointment/promotion, ranking, and compensation."<br><br>In this connection, the LEB also prescribes who may or may not be considered as full-time faculty, the classification of the members of their faculty, as well as the faculty load, including the regulation of work hours, all in violation of the academic freedom of law schools.

Plainly, these issuances are beyond mere supervision and regulation.<br><br><center><b>III.<br>Conclusion</b><br></center><br>In general, R.A. No. 7662, as a law meant to uplift the quality of legal education, does not encroach upon the Court's jurisdiction to promulgate rules under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution. It is well-within the jurisdiction of the State, as an exercise of its inherent police power, to lay down laws relative to legal education, the same being imbued with public interest.<br><br>While the Court is undoubtedly an interested stakeholder in legal education, it cannot assume jurisdiction where it has none. Instead, in judicial humility, the Court affirms that the supervision and regulation of legal education is a political exercise, where judges are nevertheless still allowed to participate not as an independent branch of government, but as part of the sovereign people.<br><br>Nevertheless, inasmuch as the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged is settled as belonging exclusively to the Court, certain provisions and clauses of R.A. No. 7662 which, by its plain language and meaning, go beyond legal education and intrude upon the Court's exclusive jurisdiction suffer from patent unconstitutionality and should therefore be struck down.<br><br>Moreover, the exercise of the power to supervise and regulate legal education is circumscribed by the normative contents of the Constitution itself, that is, it must be reasonably exercised. Reasonable exercise means that it should not amount to control and that it respects the Constitutionally­guaranteed institutional academic freedom and the citizen's right to quality and accessible education. Transgression of these limitations renders the power and the exercise thereof unconstitutional.<br><br>Accordingly, the Court recognizes the power of the LEB under its charter to prescribe minimum standards for law admission. The PhiLSAT, when administered as an aptitude test to guide law schools in measuring the applicants' aptness for legal education along with such other admissions policy that the law school may consider, is such minimum standard.<br><br>However, the PhiLSAT presently operates not only as a measure of an applicant's aptitude for law school. The PhiLSAT, as a pass or fail exam, dictates upon law schools who among the examinees are to be admitted to any law program. When the PhiLSAT is used to exclude, qualify, and restrict admissions to law schools, as its present design mandates, the PhiLSAT goes beyond mere supervision and regulation, violates institutional academic freedom, becomes unreasonable and therefore, unconstitutional. In striking down these objectionable clauses in the PhiLSAT, the State's inherent power to protect public interest by improving legal education is neither emasculated nor compromised. Rather, the institutional academic freedom of law schools to determine for itself who to admit pursuant to their respective admissions policies is merely protected. In turn, the recognition of academic discretion comes with the inherent limitation that its exercise should not be whimsical, arbitrary, or gravely abused.<br><br>In similar vein, certain LEB issuances which exceed the powers granted under its charter should be nullified for being <i>ultra vires</i>.<br><br>As in all levels and areas of education, the improvement of legal education indeed deserves serious attention. The parties are at a consensus that legal education should be made relevant and progressive. Reforms for a more responsive legal education are constantly introduced and are evolving. The PhiLSAT, for instance, is not a perfect initiative. Through time and a better cooperation between the LEB and the law schools in the Philippines, a standardized and acceptable law admission examination may be configured. The flaws which the Court assessed to be unconstitutional are meanwhile removed, thereby still allowing the PhiLSAT to develop into maturity. It is, thus, strongly urged that recommendations on how to improve legal education, including tools for screening entrants to law school, reached possibly through consultative summits, be taken in careful consideration in further issuances or legislations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.<br><br>The jurisdiction of the Legal Education Board over legal education is <b>UPHELD</b>.<br><br>The Court further declares: <br><br>As <b>CONSTITUTIONAL</b>:<br><ol><li>Section 7(c) of R.A.

[Officer] in control [lays] down the rules in the doing of an act. If they are not followed, it is discretionary on his part to order the act undone or re-done by his subordinate or he may even decide to do it himself. Supervision does not cover such authority. Supervising officers merely see to it that the rules are followed, but he himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to modify or replace them.

The essential freedoms subsumed in the term 'academic freedom' encompasses the freedom to determine for itself on academic grounds: (1) [w]ho may teach, (2) [w]hat may be taught, (3) [h]ow it shall be taught, and (4) <u><b>[w]ho may be admitted to study</b></u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This fourth freedom of law schools to determine "who may be admitted to study" is at the core of the present controversy involving the PhiLSAT.<br><br>The PhiLSAT is essentially a standardized aptitude test measuring the examinees' communications and language proficiency, critical thinking skills, and verbal and quantitative reasoning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It is designed to measure the academic potential of the examinee to pursue the study of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> One of the essential provisions of LEBMO No. 7-2016 is paragraph 9, which states that passing the PhiLSAT is required for admission to any law school in the Philippines, and that no applicant shall be admitted for enrollment as a first year student in the basic law courses leading to a degree of either Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor unless he/she has passed the PhiLSAT taken within two (2) years before the start of the study. The PhiLSAT has a passing score of 55%.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> To concretize the mandatory nature of the PhiLSAT, paragraph 15 of LEBMO No. 7-2016 provides that law schools that violate the issuance shall be administratively sanctioned and/or fined in the amount of up to P10,000.00 for each infraction. The administrative sanctions direly encompass: (a) termination of the law program (closing the law school); (b) phasing out of the law program; and (c) provisional cancellation of the Government Recognition and putting the law program of the substandard law school under Permit Status.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As the PhiLSAT is a requirement mandatorily imposed by LEBMO No. 7-2016, non-compliance therewith would result into these potential consequences.<br><br>Compliance with the PhiLSAT effectively means a surrender of the law schools' academic freedom to determine who to admit to their institutions for study. This is because the PhiLSAT operates as a sifting mechanism that narrows down the pool of potential candidates from which law schools may then select their future students. With the grave administrative sanctions imposed for non-compliance, the surrender of this facet of academic freedom is clearly compulsory, because failing to subscribe to the PhiLSAT requirement is tantamount to the law school risking its complete closure or the phasing out of its law program. <b>This effectively results in the complete control - not mere supervision - of the State over a significant aspect of the institutions' academic freedom.</b><br><br>Notably, the core legal basis for the PhiLSAT is derived from Section 7 (e) of Republic Act No. 7662<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which empowers the LEB "to prescribe the minimum standards for law admission x x x." On a broader scale, Section 7 (b) of the same law empowers the LEB "to supervise the law schools in the country x x x." This is a specific iteration of Section 4 (1), Article XIV of the 1987 Constitution which provides that "<b>[t]he State x x x shall exercise <u>reasonable supervision</u> and regulation of all educational institutions</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <u><b>"Reasonable supervision," as the Framers intended, meant only "external" and not "internal" governance; as such, it is meant to exclude the right to manage, dictate, overrule, prohibit, and dominate.</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>As elucidated in the fairly recent case of <i>Council of Teachers and Staff of Colleges and Universities of the Philippines v. Secretary of Education</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote><u><b>The Framers were explicit, however, that this supervision refers to <i>external governance</i>, as opposed to <i>internal governance</i> which was reserved to the respective school boards</b></u>, thus:<br><blockquote>Madam President, Section 2(b) introduces four changes: one, the addition of the word "reasonable" before the phrase "supervision and regulation"; two, the addition of the word "quality" before the word "education"; three, the change of the wordings in the 1973 Constitution referring to a system of education, requiring the same to be relevant to the goals of national development, to the present expression of "relevant to the needs of the people and society"; and four, the explanation of the meaning of the expression "integrated system of education" by defining the same as the <b>recognition and strengthening of the complementary roles of public and private educational institutions as separate but integral parts of the total Philippine educational system</b>.<br><br><b>When we speak of State supervision and regulation, we refer to the <u>external governance</u> of educational institutions</b>, particularly private educational institutions as distinguished from the internal governance by their respective boards of directors or trustees and their administrative officials. Even without a provision on external governance, the State would still have the inherent right to regulate educational institutions through the exercise of its police power. We have thought it advisable to restate the supervisory and regulatory functions of the State provided in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions with the addition of the word "reasonable." We found it necessary to add the word "reasonable" because of an <i>obiter dictum</i> of our Supreme Court in a decision in the case of <i>Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities vs. The Secretary of Education and the Board of Textbooks</i> in 1955. In that case, the court said, and I quote:<br><blockquote>It is enough to point out that local educators and writers think the Constitution provides for control of education by the State.<br><br>The Solicitor General cites many authorities to show that the power to regulate means power to control, and quotes from the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention to prove that State control of private education was intended by organic law.<br></blockquote></blockquote><b>The addition, therefore, of the word "reasonable" is meant to underscore the sense of the committee, that when the Constitution speaks of State supervision and regulation, <u>it does not in any way mean control</u>. We refer only to the power of the State to provide regulations and to see to it that these regulations are duly followed and implemented. <u>It does not include the right to manage, dictate, overrule and prohibit. Therefore, it does not include the right to dominate.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>As pointed out by Dean Sedfrey M. Candelaria (Dean Candelaria) in his Amicus Brief, "[w]hen [the] LEB took over the functions of the [Commission on Higher Education (CHED)] in relation to law schools, it is safe to presume that the scope of power of [the] LEB should be no more than what [the] CHED had traditionally exercised over law schools."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As to what he insinuates as "reasonable supervision" over institutions of higher learning, the State may, through the appropriate agency, determine the: (a) minimum unit requirements for a specific academic program; (b) general education distribution requirements; and (c) specific professional subjects as may be stipulated by the various licensing entities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> These activities may ostensibly fall under the category of "external governance" and hence, "reasonable supervision," as compared to a mandatory, exclusively State­ crafted aptitude test which not only operates as a predetermination of the schools' potential candidates for admission but also brandishes the total closure of the institution or phasing out of the academic program as punishment for noncompliance. The latter is, to my mind, a form of State­ domination that translates to "internal governance" and hence, the exercise of the State's control over academic freedom. As earlier intimated, this strays from the intent of the Framers of our Constitution.<br><br>While the more intricate contours of "academic freedom" have yet to be charted in our jurisprudence as compared to other individual liberties, Dean Candelaria, in his Amicus Brief, also broached the idea that academic freedom is an aspect of the freedom of expression, and hence, any regulation thereof is subject to strict scrutiny.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The tie between academic freedom and freedom of expression has yet to be definitively settled in our jurisprudence, Nevertheless, there is ostensible merit in this theory since an institution of higher learning may be treated as the embodiment of the composite rights of its individual educators, and ultimately, an educational method of instruction is a form of communication. Learning necessarily connotes an exchange of ideas. The transmission of knowledge does not happen in a vacuum but within a framework that the school autonomously determines - subject only to reasonable State regulation - a cognate part of which is who it deems fit for its instruction. As Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen eloquently stated in his Separate Dissenting and Concurring Opinion, academic discussions and other forms of scholarship are manifestations and extensions of an individual's thoughts and beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Academic freedom is anchored on the recognition that academic institutions perform a social function, and its business is conducted for the common good; that is, it is a necessary tool for critical inquiry of truth and its free exposition. Thus, <u>the guarantee of academic freedom is complementary to the freedom of expression and the freedom of the mind</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The theoretical transposition of the concept of freedom of expression/ freedom of the mind to institutional academic freedom would greatly impact the dynamic of how this Court would henceforth deal with regulations affecting institutions of higher learning because, as mentioned, the test to be applied would be strict scrutiny.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> "Strict scrutiny entails that the presumed law or policy must be justified by a compelling state or government interest, <u>that such law or policy must be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest, and that the law or policy must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In this case, while the policy of the State to "uplift the standards of legal education"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> may be characterized as a compelling State interest, the means of achieving this goal, through the PhiLSAT, together with its mandatory and exclusionary features as above-discussed, do not appear to be narrowly tailored or the least restrictive means for achieving this interest. There is no concrete showing why the implementation of a standardized but optional State aptitude exam, which schools may freely adopt in their discretion as a tool for their own determination of who to admit (such as the National Medical Aptitude Test for medical schools or the Law School Admission Test in the United States of America), would be less of a "sifting" measure than a mandatory and exclusively State-determined one (such as the PhiLSAT). This is especially so since, as conceded by LEB Chairperson Emerson B. Aquende during the oral arguments in this case, there is no statistical basis<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to show the propensity of the PhiLSAT to improve the quality of legal education. Furthermore, no other study or evaluation regarding the viability of the PhiLSAT was shown to this effect. It is true that in a general sense, the PhiLSAT operates as a basic aptitude exam which seeks to test skills that have rational connection to the field of law, <i>i.e.</i>, communications and language proficiency, critical thinking, and verbal and quantitative reasoning. However, because the test was solely crafted by the LEB, it completely excludes the law schools' input and participation, and worse, even puts their very existence in jeopardy should there be non-subservience. Verily, an absolutist approach in any facet of academic freedom would not only result in an overly restrictive State regulation, it would also be practically counterproductive because law schools, being at the forefront, are the quintessential stakeholders to the mission of improving legal education. Again, by constitutional fiat, the State's role is limited to reasonable supervision, not control. For these reasons, the provisions of LEBMO No. 7-2016 on the PhiLSAT clearly transgress institutional academic freedom.<br><br>Accordingly, I concur in the result.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See <i>fallo</i> of the <i>ponencia</i>, pp. 101-103.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> "POLICIES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF A NATIONWIDE UNIFORM LAW SCHOOL ADMISSION TEST FOR APPLICANTS TO THE BASIC LAW COURSES IN ALL LAW SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY," issued on December 29, 2016.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Emphases supplied.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Miriam College Foundation, Inc. v.

The State has no business in deciding and substituting its judgment for the academic institutions. Any government attempt to dictate upon universities the qualifications of their studentry or interfere with their curriculum undermines the school's academic freedom.<br><br>Institutions of learning perform a vital function in nurturing and sharpening the people's understanding and intellect. They ensure an educated and thriving citizenry on whom a nation's civilization and life depend. Education leads to an economically productive populace through learned skill. More importantly, it gears the people toward thinking more prudently and critically.<br><br>Without educational institutions, our country will inevitably approach a shallow and dismal future. Thus, the State has a paramount interest in guaranteeing that they flourish and function robustly. Part and parcel of this guarantee is to allow them to freely determine for themselves their "aims and objectives and how best to attain them."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>One (1) of the four (4) essential academic freedoms is the academic institutions' right to determine who they will admit to study. In ascertaining who to admit in their institutions, law schools should be given autonomy in establishing their own policies, including the examination that they will employ.<br><br>The Philippine Law School Admission Test is an unwarranted intrusion into this essential freedom. The government's imposition of a passing score as a bar to admission violates the educational institutions' academic freedom to determine <i>who to admit to study</i>. The existence of the Legal Education Board, on the other hand, interferes with the right of academic institutions with respect to how to teach and who to teach.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br>Academic freedom, as enshrined in our present Constitution, guarantees the fundamental protection to academic institutions. Article XIV, Section 5(2) states that "[a]cademic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning."<br><br>This provision is equivalent to its precursor, Article XV, Section 8(2) of the 1973 Constitution, which stated that "[a]ll institutions of higher learning shall enjoy academic freedom." This, in turn, was an expansion of its counterpart in the 1935 Constitution which limited the grant 'of academic freedom to state-established universities. Article XIII, Section 5 of the 1935 Constitution stated:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. All educational institutions shall be under the supervision of and subject to regulation by the State; The Government shall establish and maintain a complete and adequate system of public education, and shall provide at least free public primary instruction, and citizenship training to adult citizens. All schools shall aim to develop moral character, personal discipline, civic conscience, and vocational efficiency, and to teach the duties of citizenship. Optional religious instruction shall be maintained in the public schools as now authorized by law. Universities established by the State shall enjoy academic freedom. The· State shall create scholarships in arts, science, and letters for specially gifted citizens.</blockquote>From this, the 1973 Constitution provided a broader protection by giving the same guarantee to private educational institutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The nature and scope of academic freedom was first discussed at length in the 1975 case of <i>Garcia v. The Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> This Court recognized academic freedom as an institutional facet, and not solely confined to individual academic freedom or the right of faculty members to pursue their studies without fear of reprisal. In interpreting the import of the constitutional provision, this Court said:<br><blockquote>For it is to be noted that the reference is to the "institutions of higher learning" as the recipients of this boon. <i>It would follow then that the school or college itself is possessed of such a right. It decides for itself its aims and objectives and how best to attain them. It is free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. It has a wide sphere of autonomy certainly extending to the choice of students.</i> This constitutional provision is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a grudging fashion. That would be to frustrate its purpose, nullify its intent. Former President Vicente G. Sinco of the University of the Philippines, in his Philippine Political Law, is similarly of the view that it "definitely grants the right of academic freedom to the university as an institution as distinguished from the academic freedom of a university professor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><i>Garcia</i> concerned a Petition for Mandamus filed by Epicharis Garcia, a woman, to compel the Loyola School of Theology to allow her to continue her studies in the seminary. In dismissing the Petition, this Court upheld the discretion of educational institutions to choose who may be admitted to study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Garcia</i> referred to the four (4) essential freedoms as the parameters of academic freedom:<br><blockquote>Justice Frankfurter, with his extensive background in legal education as a former Professor of the Harvard Law School, referred to what he called the business of a university and the four essential freedoms in the following language: "It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. <i>It is an atmosphere in which there prevail 'the four essential freedoms' of a university - to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote>Justice Claudio Teehankee's concurring opinion in <i>Garcia</i> is also instructive. He recognized that courts have neither the competence nor the inclination to decide who shall be admitted to an educational institution. Instead, they will only overturn the judgment of academic institutions after an exhaustion of administrative remedies and upon showing of arbitrariness on the school's part. He explained:<br><br>Only after exhaustion of administrative remedies and when there is marked arbitrariness, will the courts interfere with the academic judgment of the school faculty and the proper authorities as to the competence and fitness of an applicant for enrollment or to continue taking up graduate studies in a graduate school. The courts simply do not have the competence nor inclination to constitute themselves as Admission Committees of the universities and institutions of higher learning and to substitute their judgment for that of the regularly constituted Admission Committees of such educational institutions. Were the courts to do so, they would conceivably be swamped with petitions for admission from the thousands refused admission every year, and next the thousands who flunked and were dropped would also be petitioning the courts for a judicial review of their grades.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Following the ruling in <i>Garcia</i>, this Court in <i>Tangonan v. Paño</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> reiterated that it cannot compel academic institutions to admit students who fail to meet standard policies and qualifications. To rule otherwise, it held, would violate the institution's discretion on the admission and enrollment of students as a major component of academic freedom:<br><br>[S]till petitioner would want Us to compel respondent school to enroll her despite her failure to meet the standard policies and qualifications set by the school. To grant such relief would be doing violence to the academic freedom enjoyed by the respondent school enshrined under Article XV, Section 8, Par. 2 of our Constitution which mandates "that all institutions of higher learning shall enjoy academic freedom." This institutional academic freedom includes not only the freedom of professionally qualified persons to inquire, discover, publish and teach the truth as they see it in the field of their competence subject to no control or authority except of rational methods by which truths and conclusions are sought and established in these disciplines, but also the right of the school or college to decide for itself, its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them - the grant being to institutions of higher learning - free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In <i>San Sebastian College v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> this Court likewise ruled that a student's failure to comply with academic standards justifies the institution's refusal to admit him or her.<br><br>An institution's discretion in determining who to admit extends to its decision on who to dismiss. In <i>Ateneo De Manila University v. Capulong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this Court upheld the institution's discretion to dismiss erring students. It reiterated that schools have the right to establish academic and disciplinary standards, and in failing to comply with these standards, a student can be validly dismissed:<br><blockquote>Since <i>Garcia v. Loyola School of Theology</i>, we have consistently upheld the salutary proposition that admission to an institution of higher learning is discretionary upon a school, the same being a privilege on the part of the student rather than a right. While under the Education Act of 1982, students have a right "to freely choose their field of study, subject to existing curricula and to continue their course therein up to graduation," such right is subject, as all rights are, to the established academic and disciplinary standards laid down by the academic institution.<br><br>For private schools have the right to establish reasonable rules and regulations for the admission, discipline and promotion of students. . . .<br><br>Such rules are "incident to the very object of incorporation and indispensable to the successful management of the college. The rules may include those governing student discipline." Going a step further, the establishment of rules governing university-student relations, particularly those pertaining to student discipline, may be regarded as vital, not merely to the smooth and efficient operation of the institution, but to its very survival.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>In <i>Licup v. University of San Carlos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the petitioners were students who had been denied readmission to the university after a chaotic assembly that resulted in violations of the university handbook rules. They were also found to have academic deficiencies. In upholding the university's decision, this Court held that the students were not deprived of due process during the investigation, and that their serious breach of discipline and failure to maintain the academic standard forfeited their contractual right to continue studying in the university.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> This Court ruled similarly in <i>Alcuaz v.

Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> this Court further amplified the scope of academic freedom when it upheld the institution's right to discipline its students. It pronounced:<br><blockquote>Section 5 (2), Article XIV of the Constitution guarantees all institutions of higher learning academic freedom. This institutional academic freedom includes the right of the school or college to decide for itself, its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. The essential freedoms subsumed in the term "academic freedom" encompasses the freedom to determine for itself on academic grounds:<br><blockquote>(1) Who may teach, <br>(2) What may be taught, <br>(3) How it shall be taught, and<br>(4) Who may be admitted to study.</blockquote>The right of the school to discipline its students is at once apparent in the third freedom, <i>i.e.</i>, "how it shall be taught." A school certainly cannot function in an atmosphere of anarchy.<br><br>Thus, there can be no doubt that the establishment of an educational institution requires rules and regulations necessary for the maintenance of an orderly educational program and the creation of an educational environment conducive to learning. Such rules and regulations are equally necessary for the protection of the students, faculty, and property.<br><br>Moreover, the school has an interest in teaching the student discipline, a necessary, if not indispensable, value in any field of learning. By instilling discipline, the school teaches discipline. Accordingly, the right to discipline the student likewise finds basis in the freedom "what to teach."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>An academic institution's right to discipline its students was held applicable even to students' activities outside campus premises. In <i>Angeles v. Sison</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court ruled that the school's power over its students does not absolutely cease when they set foot outside the school premises. Moreover, the students' conduct, if directly affecting the school's good order and welfare, may be subject to its discipline:<br><blockquote>A college, or any school for that matter, has a dual responsibility to its students. One is to provide opportunities for learning and the other is to help them grow and develop into mature, responsible, effective and worthy citizens of the community. Discipline is one of the means to carry out the second responsibility.<br><br>Thus, there can be no doubt that the establishment of an educational institution requires rules and regulations necessary for the maintenance of an orderly educational program and the creation of an educational environment conducive to learning. Such rules and regulations are equally necessary for the protection of the students, faculty, and property. The power of school officials to investigate, an adjunct of its power to suspend or expel, is a necessary corollary to the enforcement of such rules and regulations and the maintenance of a safe and orderly educational environment conducive to learning.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Common sense dictates that the school retains its power to compel its students in or off-campus to a norm of conduct compatible with their standing as members of the academic community. Hence, when as in the case at bar, the misconduct complained of directly affects the suitability of the alleged violators as students, there is no reason why the school cannot impose the same disciplinary action as when the act took place inside the campus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>In the more recent case of <i>Cudia v. Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court reiterated that a school's right to discipline its students is part of the third essential freedom. There, this Court upheld the Philippine Military Academy's enforcement of its internal rules pursuant to its academic freedom. The petitioner in Cudia was a graduating honor student who was dismissed for violating the institution's Honor Code. Affirming the dismissal, this Court ruled that the academy enjoys academic· freedom to impose disciplinary measures and punishment as it deems fit:<br><blockquote>The schools' power to instill discipline in their students is subsumed in their academic freedom and that "the establishment of rules governing university-student relations, particularly those pertaining to student discipline, may be regarded as vital, not merely to the smooth and efficient operation of the institution, but to its very survival." As a Bohemian proverb puts it: "A school without discipline is like a mill without water." Insofar as the water turns the mill, so does the school's disciplinary power assure its right to survive and continue operating. In this regard, the Court has always recognized the right of schools to impose disciplinary sanctions, which includes the power to dismiss or expel, on students who violate disciplinary rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Nevertheless, in <i>Villar v. Technological Institute of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court clarified that the discretion of educational institutions is not absolute as to impinge on the students' constitutional rights. In <i>Villar</i>, the petitioners took part in an assembly and were subsequently denied admission by the university, which claimed that the students flunked. In finding that some of the petitioners did not violate the school's academic standards, this Court ruled that while the institution can deny admission to students with academic deficiencies, the academic freedom it enjoys cannot be used to discriminate against qualified students who exercise their constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This Court held:<br><blockquote>The academic freedom enjoyed by "institutions of higher learning" includes the right to set academic standards to determine under what circumstances failing grades suffice for the expulsion of students. Once it has done so, however, that standard should be followed meticulously. It cannot be utilized to discriminate against those students who exercise their constitutional rights to peaceable assembly and free speech. If it does so, then there is a legitimate grievance by the students thus prejudiced, their right to the equal protection clause being disregarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>Similarly, in <i>Isabelo, Jr. v. Perpetual Help College of Rizal, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court ruled against the university's refusal to admit the petitioner as its, student. Explaining that "academic freedom has never been meant to be an unabridged license[,]" it held that the university cannot hide behind the shroud of academic freedom to act arbitrarily in dismissing a student.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <i>Malabanan v. Ramento</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>Arreza v. Gregorio Araneta University</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>Guzman v.

Dames II</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> were ruled in the same vein.<br><br>An academic institution's discretion applies not only to the admission and dismissal of its students, but also to its decision to confer academic recognition. In <i>Morales v. Board of Regents</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the petitioner was a University of the Philippines student who questioned the university's decision not to grant her the academic distinction of <i>cum laude</i> due to a contested grade computation. In upholding this decision, this Court emphasized that "the wide sphere of autonomy given to universities in the exercise of academic freedom extends to the right to confer academic honors." It held:<br><blockquote>[The] exercise of academic freedom grants the University the exclusive discretion to determine to whom among Its graduates it shall confer academic recognition, based on its established standards. And the courts may not interfere with such exercise of discretion unless there is a clear showing that the University has arbitrarily and capriciously exercised its judgment. Unlike the UP Board of Regents that has the competence and expertise in granting honors to graduating students of the University, courts do not have the competence to constitute themselves as an Honor's Committee and substitute their judgment for that of the University officials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>Nevertheless, this Court has affirmed in the past the State's power to intrude-in very limited circumstances-into the admission process of schools imbued with public interest. Specifically, students applying to medical schools have to take and pass a state-sponsored examination as a condition to their admission.<br><br>In <i>Tablarin v. Gutierrez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the petitioners questioned the constitutionality of the National Medical Admission Test, a uniform admission test required by the Board of Medical Education and administered by the Center for Educational Measurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> They sought to declare as unconstitutional portions of Republic Act No. 2382 and Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports Order No. 52-1985, which require "the taking and passing of the [National Medical Admission Test] as a condition for securing certificates of eligibility for admission."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The order characterizes the test as an aptitude examination that aims to upgrade "the selection of applicants for admission into the medical schools and . . . to improve the quality of medical education in the country."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In denying the Petition, this Court ruled that the requirement of taking and passing the National Medical Admission Test was a valid exercise of police power. It found the objectives cited in the order to be valid. It also found a reasonable relation between prescribing the test as a condition for admission to medical schools and securing the health and safety of the general public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><i>Tablarin</i> characterized state-sponsored admission tests as an exercise of police power that advanced legitimate interests.<br><br>This was further elaborated in <i>Department of Education, Culture, and Sports v. San Diego</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the issue of which also revolved around the National Medical Admission Test. In that case, the petitioners were students who questioned the three-flunk rule, which states that students may only take the exam thrice, and are barred from taking it again after three (3) successive failures.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> They argued that this limitation violates their constitutional right to academic freedom and education.<br><br>The trial court first ruled in favor of petitioners, finding that the three­ flunk rule was an arbitrary exercise of police power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> However, this Court reversed its decision and, reiterating its pronouncements in <i>Tablarin</i>, found the National Medical Admission Test to be a valid exercise of police power:<br><blockquote>The subject of the challenged regulation is certainly within the ambit of the police power. It is the right and indeed the responsibility of the State to insure that the medical profession is not infiltrated by incompetents to whom patients may unwarily entrust their lives and health.<br><br>The method employed by the challenged regulation is not irrelevant to the purpose of the law nor is it arbitrary or oppressive. The three-flunk rule is intended to insulate the medical schools and ultimately the medical profession from the intrusion of those not qualified to be doctors.<br><br>While every person is entitled to aspire to be a doctor, he does not have a constitutional right to be a doctor. This is true of any other calling in which the public interest is involved; and the closer the link, the longer the bridge to one's ambition. The State has the responsibility to harness its human resources and to see to it that they are not dissipated or, no less worse, not used at all. These resources must be applied in a manner that will best promote the common good while also giving the individual a sense of satisfaction.<br><br>A person cannot insist on being a physician if he will be a menace to his patients. If one who wants to be a lawyer may prove better as a plumber, he should be so advised and adviced (sic). Of course, he may not be forced to be a plumber, but on the other hand he may not force his entry into the bar. By the same token, a student who has demonstrated promise as a pianist cannot be shunted aside to take a course in nursing, however appropriate this career may be for others.<br><br>The right to quality education invoked by the private respondent is not absolute. The Constitution also provides that "every citizen has the right to choose a profession or course of study, subject to fair, reasonable and equitable admission and academic requirements."<br><br>The private respondent must yield to the challenged rule and give way to those better prepared. Where even those who have qualified may still not be accommodated in our already crowded medical schools, there is all the more reason to bar those who, like him, have been tested and found wanting.<br><br>The contention that the challenged rule violates the equal protection clause is not well-taken. A law does not have to operate with equal force on all persons or things to be conformable to Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution.<br><br>There can be no question that a substantial distinction exists between medical students and other students who are not subjected to the National Medical Admission Test and the three-flunk rule. The medical profession directly affects the very lives of the people, unlike other careers which, for this reason, do not require more vigilant regulation. The accountant, for example, while belonging to an equally respectable profession, does not hold the same delicate responsibility as that of the physician and so need not be similarly treated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><i>Department of Education, Culture, and Sports</i> highlighted the special character of the medical profession, which justifies the three-flunk rule in the National Medical Admission Test in force at that time. As the medical profession "directly affects the very lives of the people,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court found that the three-flunk rule was valid insofar as it seeks to admit only those who are academically qualified to study in a medical school.<br><br><i>Tablarin</i> and <i>Department of Education, Culture, and Sports</i> both resolved issues on the right to quality education and the right to choose a profession vis-a-vis the State's power to regulate admission to schools through a uniform aptitude test. In both cases, this Court found that administering the National Medical Admission Test was a reasonable exercise of police power.<br><br>However, it should be remembered that the parties in these cases were student-applicants who asserted their right to the course of study of their own choosing. The issue of institutional academic freedom in relation to a standardized test imposed by the State was not discussed. The medical schools covered by the order that institutionalizes the National Medical Admission Test have not asserted their exclusive right to determine who may be admitted to their institutions pursuant to their academic freedom.<br><br><i>Reyes v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> comes close. There, students of the University of the Philippines College of Medicine questioned the National Medical Admission Test's cutoff grade for admission, which was prescribed by the college faculty but was not approved by the University Council. The faculty, for its part, asserted institutional academic freedom in arguing that it had the power to determine the admission requirements of the college. However, this Court found that this power was vested in the University Council, not the faculty:<br><blockquote>Under the UP Charter, the power to fix admission requirements is vested in the University Council of the autonomous campus which is composed of the President of the University of the Philippines and of all instructors holding the rank of professor, associate professor or assistant professor (Section 9, Act 1870). Consequently, the UC alone has the right to protest against any unauthorized exercise of its power. Petitioners cannot impugn these BOR directives on the ground of academic freedom inasmuch as their rights as university teachers remain unaffected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><i>Reyes</i>, therefore, resolved an issue that was not so much a question of whether the State violated institutional academic freedom, but whether it was the proper academic unit that asserted this freedom.<br><br>The crucial question before this Court now is whether the state­-sponsored Philippine Law School Admission Test, in its current configuration, violates institutional academic freedom.<br><br>I agree with the majority that it does.<br><br>As found by the majority, the Philippine Law School Admission Test, unlike the National Medical Admission Test, violates institutional academic freedom<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> insofar as it prescribes a passing score that must be followed by law schools.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Failure to reach the passing score will disqualify the examinee from admission to any Philippine law school.

Thus, academic freedom is constitutionally granted to students, faculty, and academic institutions alike:<br><blockquote>Notwithstanding the increasingly broad reach of academic freedom and the current emphasis on the essentiality of autonomy for academic institutions, the freedom of individual faculty members against control of thought or utterance from either within or without the employing institutions remains the core of the matter. <i>If this freedom exists and reasonably adequate academic administration and methods of faculty selection prevail, intellectual interchange and pursuit of knowledge are secured.</i> A substantial degree of institutional autonomy is both a usual prerequisite and a normal consequence of such a state of affairs. . . . Hence the main concern over developing and maintaining academic freedom in this country has focused upon encouragement and protection of the freedom of the faculty member.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Academic freedom is anchored on the recognition that academic institutions perform a social function and its business is conducted for the common good; that is, it is a necessary tool for critical inquiry of truth and its free exposition. The guarantee of academic freedom is complementary to freedom of expression and of the mind.<br><br>Thus, to foster an environment of critical discussion and inquiry, the faculty must be given a degree of independence from their employers, and universities must have a degree of independence from the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This constitutional protection guaranteed for the students, faculty, and institutions is not merely a job-related concern or an institutional interest; rather, it "promotes First Amendment values of general concern to all citizens in a democracy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>As eloquently discussed by then Justice Felix Makasiar in his dissenting opinion in <i>Garcia</i>, blows against academic freedom inevitably strike at the core of freedom of expression:<br><blockquote>The cardinal article of faith of our democratic civilization is the preservation and enhancement of the dignity and worth of the human personality. It was Mr. Justice Frankfurter himself who emphasized that man's "inviolate character" should be "protected to the largest possible extent in his thoughts and in his beliefs as the citadel of his person", so that the individual can fully develop himself and achieve complete fulfillment. His freedom to seek his own happiness would mean nothing if the same were not given sanctuary "against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments and the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles".<br><br>. . . This individual freedom and right to happiness should be recognized and respected not only by the State but also by enterprises authorized by the State to operate; for as Laski stressed: "Without freedom of the mind . . . a man has no protection in our social order. He may speak wrongly or foolishly, . . . Yet a denial of his right . . . is a denial of his happiness. Thereby he becomes an instrument of other people's ends, not himself an end".<br><br>As Justice Holmes pronounced, "the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market; and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out".<br><br>The human mind is by nature an inquiring mind, whether of the very young or of the very old or in-between; for freedom of speech in the words of John Milton is the "liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties."<br><br>What is involved here is not merely academic freedom of the higher institutions of learning as guaranteed by Section 8(2) of Article [X]V of the 1973 Constitution. The issue here strikes at the broader freedom of expression of the individual - the very core of human liberty.<br><br>Even if the term "academic freedom" were to be limited to institutions of higher learning - which to the mind of Dr. Vicente Sinco, an eminent authority in Constitutional Law, is the right of the university as an institution, not the academic freedom of the university professor - the term "institutions of higher learning" contained in the aforecited provision of our New Constitution comprehends not only the faculty and the college administrators but also the members of the student body. While it is true that the university professor may have the initiative and resourcefulness to pursue his own research and formulate his conclusions concerning the problem of his own science or subject, the motivation therefor may be provoked by questions addressed to him by his students. In this respect, the student - specially a graduate student - must not be restrained from raising questions or from challenging the validity of dogmas, whether theological or not. The true scholar never avoids, but on the contrary welcomes and encourages, such searching questions even if the same will have the tendency to uncover his own ignorance. It is not the happiness and self-fulfillment of the professor alone that are guaranteed. <i>The happiness and full development of the curious intellect of the student are protected by the narrow guarantee of academic freedom and more so by the broader right of free expression, which includes free speech and press, and academic freedom.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>Academic freedom is intertwined with intellectual liberty.

To impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation. No field of education is so thoroughly comprehended by man that new discoveries cannot yet be made. Particularly is that true in the social sciences, where few, if any, principles are accepted as absolutes. Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust.

As part of their academic self-government, law schools are given the discretion to come up with an autonomous decision on their admission policies, including the examination they will administer. A state-sponsored examination like the Philippine Law School Admission Test, which tends to control the internal affairs of academic institutions, runs afoul of that essential freedom.<br><br>Moreover, according to the majority, "[t]he subject of the [Philippine Law School Admission Test] is to improve the quality of legal education."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Thus, under the State's police power, the imposition of the test is justified by the State's interest to improve the quality of legal education.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>I view that the thesis that changing the admissions policy will improve the quality of law schools is non-sequitur.<br><br>The standards for choosing who to admit are entirely different from the standards for maintaining or ensuring the quality of instruction.

The Philippine Law School Admission Test is, therefore, arbitrary.<br><br>A closer look shows that the Philippine Law School Admission Test does not merely recommend, but dictates on law schools who are qualified to be admitted. By prescribing a passing score and predetermining who may enroll in law schools, the State forces its judgment on the institutions, when it has no business doing so.

Being government appointees, its members are prone to influences by their appointing power, consequently undermining the academe's most significant roles: to inquire into the truth, to powerfully disseminate this truth, and to speak this truth to power.<br><br>In the United States, admission to law schools is usually preceded by taking a standardized aptitude examination called the Law School Admission Test. While it may seem similar to our own test, important distinctions must be made. First, the U.S. Law School Admission Test is not a state-sponsored exam.

The State's intrusion, whatever form it may be, stifles the ability of the academic institution to be critical. This Court should remain ever so vigilant on any infraction of the Constitution disguised with good intentions.<br><br>Law schools are the principal institutions that have the space to analyze, deconstruct, and even critique our laws and jurisprudence. They not only teach doctrine, but examine its fundamentals.<br><br>The kind of freedom of expression contained in academic freedom is different from political expression. Within political or creative spaces, freedom of expression takes an almost unqualified immunity. Any thought, whether or not it is hated by the dominant, finds protection without regard to its slant or falsity. In the sphere of political debate, falsehoods are platforms for testing reason and providing opportunities to publicly advocate what is true persuasively.<br><br>On the other hand, within the academe, falsities in method and content are deliberately rooted out, exposed, and marginalized so that the public debate is enriched, whether among the institution's students or the world beyond its walls. Academic freedom is the constitutional canon that protects this space from politics. It is the freedom that assures academic intellectual debate without fear of any governmental intervention of any kind, be it coercive or suggestive.<br><br>Government-sponsored standardized admission tests infringe on this freedom without reason.<br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br>Due process is guaranteed under our Constitution. Its Article III, Section 1 states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law[.]</blockquote>The due process clause is commonly referred to as the "right to be let alone" from the State's interference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The essence of due process is the freedom from arbitrariness. In <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><blockquote>"There is no controlling and precise definition of due process. It furnishes though a standard to which governmental action should conform in order that deprivation of life, liberty or property, in each appropriate case, be valid. What then is the standard of due process which must exist both as a procedural and as substantive requisite to free the challenged ordinance, or any governmental action for that matter, from the imputation of legal infirmity sufficient to spell its doom? It is responsiveness to the supremacy of reason, obedience to the dictates of justice. Negatively put, arbitrariness is ruled out and unfairness avoided. To satisfy the due process requirement, official action, to paraphrase Cardozo, must not outrun the bounds of reason and result in sheer oppression. Due process is thus hostile to any official action marred by lack of reasonableness. Correctly has it been identified as freedom from arbitrariness. It is the embodiment of the sporting idea of fair play. It exacts fealty 'to those strivings for justice' and judges the act of officialdom of whatever branch 'in the light of reason drawn from considerations of fairness that reflect [democratic] traditions of legal and political thought.' It is not a narrow or 'technical conception with fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances,' decisions based on such a clause requiring a 'close and perceptive inquiry into fundamental principles of our society.' Questions of due process are not to be treated narrowly or pedantically in slavery to form or phrases."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote>Due process is the protection of the sphere of individual autonomy. It aims to "prevent arbitrary governmental encroachment against the life, liberty and property of individuals."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Thus, it imposes a burden on the government to observe two (2) separate limits: (1) procedural and (2) substantive due process. In <i>White Light Corporation v. City of Manila</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><blockquote>The due process guaranty has traditionally been interpreted as imposing two related but distinct restrictions on government, "procedural due process" and "substantive due process". Procedural due process refers to the procedures that the government must follow before it deprives a person of life, liberty, or property. Procedural due process concerns itself with government action adhering to the established process when it makes an intrusion into the private sphere. Examples range from the form of notice given to the level of formality of a hearing.<br><br>If due process were confined solely to its procedural aspects, there would arise absurd situation of arbitrary government action, provided the proper formalities are followed. Substantive due process completes the protection envisioned by the due process clause. It inquires whether the government has sufficient justification for depriving a person of life, liberty, or property.<br><br>The question of substantive due process, more so than most other fields of law, has reflected dynamism in progressive legal thought tied with the expanded acceptance of fundamental freedoms. Police power, traditionally awesome as it may be, is now confronted with a more rigorous level of analysis before it can be upheld. The vitality though of constitutional due process has not been predicated on the frequency with which it has been utilized to achieve a liberal result for, after all, the libertarian ends should sometimes yield to the prerogatives of the State. Instead, the due process clause has acquired potency because of the sophisticated methodology that has emerged to determine the proper metes and bounds for its application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Substantive due process answers the question of whether "the government has an adequate reason for taking away a person's life, liberty, or property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> To pass this test, the State must provide a sufficient justification for enforcing a governmental regulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>While the State's intrusion is not absolutely proscribed, due process requires that the intrusion on an individual's right to life, liberty, and property is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In <i>Ichong v. Hernandez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><blockquote>The due process clause has to do with the reasonableness of legislation enacted in pursuance of the police power, Is there public interest, a public purpose; is public welfare involved? Is the Act reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the legislature's purpose; is it not unreasonable, arbitrary or oppressive? Is there sufficient foundation or reason in connection with the matter involved; or has there not been a capricious use of the legislative power? Can the aims conceived be achieved by the means used, or is it not merely an unjustified interference with private interest? These are the questions that we ask when the due process test is applied.<br><br>The conflict, therefore, between police power and the guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws is more apparent than real. Properly related, the power and the guarantees are supposed to coexist. The balancing is the essence or, shall it be said, the indispensable means for the attainment of legitimate aspirations of any democratic society. There can be no absolute power, whoever exercise it, for that would be tyranny. Yet there can neither be absolute liberty, for that would mean license and anarchy.

For lack of any substantial basis, the administration of the Philippine Law School Admission Test is arbitrary.<br><br>Moreover, the Philippine Law School Admission Test transgresses due process for being unreasonable. At the core of this test is the enforcement of a written exam that supposedly sifts and sets apart individuals who are likely to survive law school. The exclusionary result is based on a single criterion-if the applicants pass the written exam, they are deemed qualified. There is no other basis used for the evaluation of applicants. Through the Philippine Law School Admission Test, the government imposes a single determinant to ascertain who can pursue legal education. This is insufficient to hurdle the requirement of due process. Reasonableness demands that a multi-varying approach is used in evaluating law school applicants.<br><br>American jurisprudence sheds more light on this. In <i>Grutter v.

The law school used race as one (1) of the criteria in its admission policy to avoid a monolithic student demographic that is typically admitted by traditional admissions processes.<br><br>In upholding the policy, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law school's educational judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission must be respected, and that universities must be given' a degree of deference when it comes to academic decisions:<br><blockquote>In announcing the principle of student body diversity as a compelling state interest, Justice Powell invoked our cases recognizing a constitutional dimension, grounded in the First Amendment, of educational autonomy: "The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body." From this premise, Justice Powell reasoned that by claiming "the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the 'robust exchange of ideas,'" a university "seek[s] to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission." Our conclusion that the Law School has a compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's proper institutional mission, and that "good faith" on the part of a university is "presumed" absent "a showing to the contrary."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>In <i>Grutter</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a holistic evaluation of an applicant by considering several factors such as academic ability, talents, experiences, including other information through a personal statement, letters of recommendation, together with the applicant's undergraduate grade point average, Law School Admission Test score, and other "soft variables," including the applicant's racial and ethnic status. In effect, the law school affords an individualized consideration to all applicants regardless of race.

The formulation is, thus, an aspirational declaration, not merely operating on factual gives but enabling the pursuit of ideals.<br><br>"Life," then, is more appropriately understood as the fullness of human potential: not merely organic, physiological existence, but consummate self-actualization, enabled and effected not only by freedom from bodily restraint but by facilitating an empowering existence. "Life and liberty," placed in the context of a constitutional aspiration, it then becomes the duty of the government to facilitate this empowering existence. This is not an inventively novel understanding but one that has been at the bedrock of our social and political conceptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Ultimately, the right to life is intertwined with the right to pursue an education. Right to life, after all, is not merely the right to exist, but the right to achieve the "fullness of human potential[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> This is real in attaining a degree of one's own choice. Education does not only enhance and sharpen intellect, but also opens up better opportunities. It improves the quality of life. When a person obtains a degree, there is economic and social mobility. Thus, when the State interferes and prevents an individual from accessing education, it impliedly infringes on the right to life and liberty.<br><br>In the same vein, imposing an arbitrary and unreasonable government-sponsored standardized test violates the right to property. Applicants, forced to take the mandatory examination, are likewise required to pay testing fees. This means additional financial cost that acts as another unnecessary obstacle to aspiring law students.<br><br>Yet, more than the financial barrier, going through the bureaucracy of studying for, applying for, and actually taking the test also entails opportunity cost.

A meritocratic method based on these tests does not necessarily mean that the most qualified students are admitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> For one, meritocracy was originally a term of abuse, used to describe a "ludicrously unequal state."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Rather than measure fairness, it disproportionately benefits those who are well-off.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> For another, entrance tests have historically been skewed in favor of elite applicants who have significant advantage and access to better education, resources, and wealth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>As Stanford Law professor Richard Banks concluded:<br><blockquote>Differential access to achievement-related resources may occur at the level of a child's family, school, or neighborhood.<br><br>The relative achievement formulation of socioeconomic status would encompass family characteristics such as parental income, education, occupation, and wealth.

Meritocracy opposes democratization and opportunity for all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>Even if national standardized tests were non-exclusionary, and were designed only to guide law schools, harm still persists in their mandatory character. Obviously, they entail both financial and opportunity cost for the applicant. An admission exam like the Philippine Law School Admission Test presents another financial barrier for an applicant.<br><br>This Court cannot ignore the greater disparity that prevails among income classes, ethnicities, and even geographical differences. The cost of taking the Philippine Law School Admission Test creates an additional burden and prevents applicants from the middle to low-income strata from pursuing legal education. The test morphs into a selective mechanism that unduly favors the wealthy. Even if the results of the exams are non-­exclusionary, the costs virtually make the exam itself exclusionary.<br><br>Moreover, students with low scores in the national test, which was created without the participation of true academics who understand test metrics, will consider themselves inferior. Because the results are ranked, the test creates a stigma on those who received low scores and excludes them. A national standardized exam, even as a non-exclusionary list, when state-sponsored, creates an unnecessary hierarchy.<br><br>Besides, that a law school is producing good lawyers does not automatically mean that it is a good law school. On the contrary, having a standardized national admission exam hides the defects and inadequacies of a law school. Students who ranked high in the Philippine Law School Admission Test, but went on to study in a school that may not exactly have good standards of education, may still likely pass the bar examinations. This is because students who topped the Philippine Law School Admission Test are not a random sample. Right at the start, they have already enjoyed a good foundation of education and a conducive environment to excel, equipped with the advantage of financial resources.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Philippine Law School Admission Test effectively screens applicants not on the basis of merit alone, but on the resources they possess. Through it, law schools are encouraged to work with better-equipped students. They are incentivized in catering to the elite in our society.<br><br>Ironically, we incentivize sloth among law schools.<br><br>Justice Clarence Thomas' (Justice Thomas) dissent in <i>Grutter</i> is likewise illuminating. Proposing that law schools must end their reliance on the Law School Admission Test, he suggested adopting different methods of admission "such as accepting all students who meet minimum qualifications,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> instead of betting on the highest scores.<br><br>Justice Thomas questioned whether standardized admission tests are reliable in predicting the success of applicants in law school. He does not believe that the test serves any real educational significance, but is only used to admit high scorers. The test, he notes, translates to selectivity-a marker of elitism:<br><blockquote>[T]here is much to be said for the view that the use of tests and other measures to "predict" academic performance is a poor substitute for a system that gives every applicant a chance to prove he can succeed in the study of law. The rallying cry that in the absence of racial discrimination in admissions there would be a true meritocracy ignores the fact that the entire process is poisoned by numerous exceptions to "merit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></blockquote>Here in the Philippines, our education system's obsession with examination-based meritocracy must be tempered, not further celebrated. Legal education must not be an exclusive good for the elite. There must be a conscious move to eliminate the socio-economic barriers that cement this elitism. The Philippine Law School Admission Test does the exact opposite by reinforcing a faulty method that does not necessarily admit the most qualified students, but only favors the economically privileged.<br><br>National standardized admission tests reward this blind and corrosive meritocracy. Crudely rewarding merit without understanding its context undermines the constitutional goal of achieving social justice. Rewarding merit alone or privileging it results in more inequality.<br><br>There has never been a level playing field in basic, secondary, and tertiary education. In the first place, not all poor and rural students who enter basic education make it to college. Fewer still are those that finish their college degrees. Most of the poor rural students will not rank high in a national standardized test due to limited access to resources in their communities. This does not mean, however, that they are so mentally deficient that they will not make it in law school. Rather, the national standardized test will most likely exclude them because they will be put in the proverbial back of the line.<br><br>Those from privileged families, by contrast, are more likely to grow up in an environment that nurtures cognitive development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> They have likely received social and cultural capital that propel them to do better in school.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Chances are they attended good schools staffed with competent teachers and professionals, learning with other privileged students.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>The inevitably low ranking of poor students adds to their burden. In the meantime, rich, privileged students will, as usual, get better chances. This situation only perpetuates the status quo, ultimately putting meritocracy as a barrier to the principle of equality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>On its surface, the contemporary idea of meritocracy is appealing because "it carries with it the idea of moving beyond where you start in life, of creative flourishing and fairness."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> But this understanding is a myth, as our system rewards through wealth and it increases inequality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Financially privileged students are way ahead of those who have much less, and any merit-based system will only serve to further highlight this privilege:<br><blockquote>In this intergenerational relay race, children born to wealthy parents start at or near the finish line, while children born into poverty start behind everyone else. Those who are born close to the finish line do not need any merit to get ahead. They already are ahead, The poorest of the poor, however, need to traverse the entire distance to get to the finish line on the basis of merit alone. In this sense, meritocracy strictly applies only to the poorest of the poor; everyone else has at least some advantage of inheritance that places them ahead at the start of the race.<br><br>In comparing the effects of inheritance and individual merit on life outcomes, the effects of inheritance come first, then the effects of individual merit follow-not the other way around.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></blockquote>An educational system that rewards on the basis of loosely defined merits assumes an equality of educational opportunity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> It fails to recognize that the most privileged in society are provided with much greater opportunities to succeed and fewer chances to fail compared with those from less privileged backgrounds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>All these privileges that are attached to a person simply by the circumstances of his or her birth snowball within an educational system that hides behind the sanitized concept of meritocracy. In truth, such concept only widens the existing economic, social, and cultural inequality.<br><br>It is, thus, inaccurate to use the results of a standardized test as proxies for measuring the capability of students to do well in law school. The competitive and individualistic meritocracy that standardized tests espouse rests on the neoliberal assumption that hard work and effort alone will result in success. It is, however, almost deliberately blind to the reality that the starting line for success is unequal, and the path toward it more challenging for those disfavored by the system. In reality, a national standardized test only rewards crude meritocracy. Meritocracy, then, disguises prejudice.<br><br><center>V</center><br>In this case, the majority declared unconstitutional several provisions of the Legal Education Reform Act and Memorandum Orders of respondent Legal Education Board. However, it essentially retained the Philippine Law School Admission Test. It ruled that Section 7(e) of the Legal Education Reform Act<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> is faithful to the reasonable supervision and regulation clause under the Constitution.

To recapitulate, its mandatory character means that if an applicant fails, he or she is disqualified from enrolling in any law school, even when a law school determines that the unsuccessful examinee should be admitted as its student. Removing its mandatory character, but retaining the test nonetheless, perpetuates the stigma that attaches to an applicant who passes but scores low relative to other examinees. Thus, the power of respondent Legal Education Board to implement the Philippine Law School Admission Test, even as a minimum requirement for admission, is already a demonstration of State control over the law schools.<br><br>The academic institutions' right to determine who they will admit to study remains among their four (4) essential freedoms.

The government's imposition of a passing score as a bar to admission is a violation of the institutions' academic freedom.<br><br>The rationale of this decision in relation to the significance of academic freedom in our jurisdiction also applies to the entire concept of the Legal Education Board.<br><br>The teaching of law as an academic degree is protected by Article XIV, Section 5(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> of the Constitution, which also relates to Article III, Section 4<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> under the Bill of Rights.

Thus, the law school is accountable to its academic councils for its approaches to teaching, qualifications and promotion of its professors, as well as the full contents of its curriculum.<br><br>The broad and ambiguous rubric of police power should not be an excuse to provide government oversight on purely academic matters, or even· academic matters that appear to be administrative issues. Academic supervision cannot be done by a statutorily appointed Legal Education Board restricting the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning which offer what amounts to a postgraduate degree. Legal education cannot be supervised in the way institutions offering pre-school or basic elementary education are supervised. The entire concept of the Legal Education Board-appointed public officials interfering with law schools' academic freedoms as if the appointment from an elective official gives them the academic expertise-is precisely what Article XIV, Section 5(2) of the Constitution proscribes.<br><br>The entire Legal Education Reform Act clearly violates the Constitution. It is, therefore, surprising that the majority is unwilling to strike it down. It is likewise astounding that the majority seems to put its trust on the evolution of law as an academic discipline to political appointees.<br><br>There are better ways to ensure the quality of legal education, none of which involves a super body similar to the Legal Education Board.

And, in instances when academic freedom has been invoked as a personal right-that is, one in favor of individuals (whether an educator or a student), the same has been always been inextricably linked (or discussed in relation) to said individual's <i>broader</i> freedom of expression.<br><br><center>1</center><br>The concept of academic freedom began in medieval Europe, where it was used as to protect universities as a community of scholars against ecclesiastical and political intrusion. It was then carried over to Latin America, where it was used to create sanctuaries out of universities for people who were under political persecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Academic freedom thereafter developed as a legal right consisting of three key concepts: (1) the philosophy of intellectual freedom for teachers and scholars; (2) the idea of autonomy for the university as a community of scholars; and (3) the guarantee of free expression in the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the conceptualization of academic freedom in the United States (U.S.) is that it exists to protect scholarship in higher education from untoward political intrusions, mainly through allowing universities to enjoy autonomy over policies of education.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Furthermore, while it is conceded to overlap with <i>civic free speech</i>, academic freedom is delineated from the former by limiting it as professional speech within higher education, rather than the rights of expression granted to citizens against broader governmental interference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The first mention of academic freedom in a U.S. Supreme Court case came with the promulgation of <i>Adler v.

The increasing role of the public school is seized upon by proponents of the type of legislation represented by New York's Feinberg law as proof of the importance and need for keeping the school free of "subversive influences." But that is to misconceive the effect of this type of legislation. Indeed, the impact of this kind of censorship on the public-school system illustrates the high purpose of the First Amendment in freeing speech and thought from censorship.<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br><b>The very threat of such a procedure is certain to raise havoc with academic freedom.</b> Youthful indiscretions, mistaken causes, misguided enthusiasms-all long forgotten-become the ghosts of a harrowing present.

The Government shall establish and maintain a complete and adequate system of public education, and shall provide at least free public primary instruction, and citizenship training to adult citizens. All schools shall aim to develop moral character, personal discipline, civic conscience, and vocational efficiency, and to teach the duties of citizenship. Optional religious instruction shall be maintained in the public schools as now authorized by law. Universities established by the State shall enjoy <b>academic freedom</b>. The State shall create scholarships in arts, science, and letters for specially gifted citizens. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>It was restated in the 1973 Constitution in Article XV, Section 8(2) and. was expanded in application to cover both private and public institutions of higher learning, to wit:<br><blockquote>Sec. 8. x x x<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>(2) All institutions of higher learning shall enjoy <b>academic freedom</b>.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>This amendment in the academic freedom clause was explained as a categorical shift from the previous conception that academic freedom was solely institutional in nature, to be enjoyed only by the institutions themselves, to the present belief that said grant is given not only to the institutions themselves, but to the individual stakeholders (teachers, researchers and students) within said institution as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Among others, the critical import of academic freedom has been seen in the dynamics of Philippine national life, where it became a necessary tool used by faculty members and students of an institution to "re-examine existing knowledge and reweigh the prevailing values so dearly cherished by the majority."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> During the period of Martial Law, for instance, especially during the. rise of student activism during the First Quarter Storm, universities served as refuge for those who were politically targeted by the ruling regime, under the protection of the academic freedom that the universities enjoyed. The nature of academic freedom as a right has been seen as a furtherance of the right to freedom of expression, that is, faculty members and students, as stakeholders of the institutions of higher learning, enjoy the freedom of expression even if they are within the university.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The general perception, in fact, appears to be that academic freedom is not only enshrined in the Constitution, but is <u>part and parcel of one's freedom of expression</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Garcia v. The Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court, in discussing the concept of academic freedom, held:<br><blockquote>2. Nor is this all. There is, as previously noted, the recognition in the Constitution of institutions of higher learning enjoying academic freedom. It is more often identified with the right of a faculty member to pursue his studies in his particular specialty and thereafter <u>to make known or publish</u> the result of his endeavors without fear that retribution would be visited on him in the event that his conclusions are found distasteful or objectionable to the powers that be, whether in the political, economic, or academic establishments. For the sociologist, Robert McIver it is "<u>a right</u> claimed by the accredited educator, as teacher and as investigator, to interpret his findings and <u>to communicate his conclusions</u> without being subjected to any interference, molestation, or penalization because these conclusions are unacceptable to some constituted authority within or beyond the institution." As for the educator and philosopher Sidney Hook, this is his version: "What is academic freedom? Briefly put, <u>it is the freedom of professionally qualified persons to</u> inquire, discover, <u>publish and teach the truth as they see it</u> in the field of their competence. It is subject to no control or authority except the control or authority of the rational methods by which truths or conclusions are sought and established in these disciplines."<br><br>3. That is only one aspect though. Such a view does not comprehend fully the scope of academic freedom recognized by the Constitution. For it is to be noted that the reference is to the "institutions of higher learning" as the recipients of this boon. It would follow then that the school or college itself is possessed of such a right. It decides for itself its aims and objectives and how best to attain them. It is free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. It has a wide sphere of autonomy certainly extending to the choice of students. This constitutional provision is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a gradging fashion. That would be to frustrate its purpose, nullify its intent. Former President Vicente G. Sinco of the University of the Philippines, in his Philippine Political Law, is similarly of the view that it "definitely grants the right of academic freedom to the university as an institution as distinguished from the academic freedom of a university professor." He cited the following from Dr. Marcel Bouchard, Rector of the University of Dijon, France, President of the conference of rectors and vice-chancellors of European universities: "It is a well-established fact, and yet one which sometimes tends to be obscured in discussions of the problems of freedom, that the collective liberty of an organization is by no means the same thing as the freedom of the individual members within it; in fact, the two kinds of freedom are not even necessarily connected. In considering the problems of academic freedom one must distinguish, therefore, between the autonomy of the university, as a corporate body, and the freedom of the individual university teacher." Also: "To clarify further the distinction between the freedom of the university and that of the individual scholar, he says: The personal aspect of freedom consists in the right of each university teacher-recognized and effectively guaranteed by society-<u>to seek and express the truth as he personally sees it, both in his academic work and in his capacity as a private citizen</u>. Thus the status of the individual university teacher is at least as important, in considering academic freedom, as the status of the institutions to which they belong and through which they disseminate their learning." x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><i>Garcia</i> and subsequent cases would show the Court's attempts to outline the distinction between academic freedom as a right enjoyed by the educational institution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> or its individual stakeholders such as the teacher/researcher/educator<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or student.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center>B</center><br>In this case, and save for petitioner-intervenor St. Thomas More School of Law and Business (St. Thomas More), all petitioners appear to be <i>individual</i> educators and students.

That upgrading is sought by selectivity in the process of admission, selectivity consisting, among other things, of limiting admission to those who exhibit in the required degree the aptitude for medical studies and eventually for medical practice. The need to maintain, and the difficulties of maintaining, high standards in our professional schools in general, and medical schools in particular, in the current stage of our social and economic development, are widely known.<br><br><b>We believe that the government is entitled to prescribe an admission test like the NMAT as a means for achieving its stated objective of "upgrading the selection of applicants into [our] medical schools" and of "improv[ing] the quality of medical education in the country."</b> Given the widespread use today of such admission tests in, for instance, medical schools in the United States of America (the Medical College Admission Test [MCAT] and quite probably in other countries with far more developed educational resources than our own, and taking into account the failure or inability of the petitioners to even attempt to prove otherwise, we are entitled to hold <b>that the NMAT is reasonably related to the securing of the ultimate end of legislation and regulation in this area.

Although the same DO provides that the NMAT rating of an applicant will be considered "with other admission requirements" as basis for the issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility, it also provides that no such Certificate will be issued without the required NMAT qualification (that is, meeting the <b>cut-off score</b>-which shall be determined by the Board of Medical Education on a yearly basis). <b>That the NMAT, similar to the PhiLSAT, was meant to be exclusionary in nature is clear from DepEd DO No. 11, issued subsequently in 1987, which provides that the cut-off score of 45<sup>th</sup> percentile shall he followed for the December 6, 1987 and April 24, 1988 NMAT examinations.</b><br><br>In fact, this exclusionary nature appears to subsist to this day.

A university ceases to be true to its own nature if it becomes the tool of Church or State or any sectional interest.

According to Justice Makasiar:<br><blockquote>What is involved here is not merely academic freedom of the higher institutions of learning as guaranteed by Section 8(2) of Article [V] of the 1973 Constitution. The issue here strikes at the broader freedom of expression of the individual - the very core of human liberty.<br><br>Even if the term "academic freedom" were to be limited to institutions of higher learning ­which to the mind of Dr. Vicente Sinco, an eminent authority in Constitutional Law, is the right of the university as an institution, not the academic freedom of the university professor (Sinco, Phil. Political Law, 1962 ed., 489)-the term "institutions of higher learning" contained in the aforecited provision of our New Constitution comprehends not only the faculty and the college administrators but also the members of the student body. While it is true that the university professor may have the initiative and resourcefulness to pursue his own research and formulate his conclusions concerning the problem of his own science or subject, the motivation therefor may be provoked by questions addressed to him by his students. In this respect, the student-specially a graduate student-must not be restrained from raising questions or from challenging the validity of dogmas whether theological or not. The true scholar never avoids, but on the contrary welcomes and encourages, such searching questions even if the same will have the tendency to uncover his own ignorance. It is not the happiness and self-fulfillment of the professor alone that are guaranteed. The happiness and full development of the curious intellect of the student are protected by the narrow guarantee of academic freedom and <u>more so by the broader right of free expression, which includes free speech and press, and academic freedom</u>.

Apart from the reasons already stated in the <i>ponencia</i>, I note that the petitioners, particularly those in G.R. No. 230642, questioned the entire law, not just the provision empowering the LEB to impose standards for admission into law schools. Moreover, the substantive issues in this case had been expanded in the Advisory for the oral arguments, to cover the following:</masscases.com></https:></https:></http:><br><http: www.="" ust.edu.ph="" civil-law=""><https: arellanolaw.edu="" alpr="" v4n1c.pdf=""><https: supreme.justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 22="" 1=""><masscases.com cases="" sjc="" 61="" 61mass53.html=""><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>Whether or not R.A. No. 7662 violates the academic freedom of law schools, specifically:<br><br>a. Section 7(c) which empowers the LEB to set the standards of accreditation for law schools taking into account, among others, the size of enrollment, the qualifications of the members of the faculty, the library and other facilities[;]<br><br>b. Section 7(e) which empowers the LEB to prescribe minimum standards for law admission;<br><br>c.

As there are other pressing concerns about the operations of the LEB-vis-a-vis academic freedom, the <i>ponencia</i> was correct in looking into the LEB's issuances and rulings beyond those covering the PhiLSAT. Stated otherwise, the Court is called upon to look at the entirety of R.A. 7662, as well as the issuances of the LEB, and to test their validity on the basis of the primordial issue of whether they violate the academic freedom of law schools: an exercise the Court is actually called upon to do given that there are no factual issues involved.<br><br>While it is true that, on the surface, the issue on the validity of the PhiLSAT is the centerpiece of the instant petitions, a deeper understanding of the issues raised herein, as well as the discussions that arose from the oral arguments, readily reveals that at the heart of the instant controversy is the constitutionality of the LEB's powers under R.A. 7662 <u><b>and the reasonableness of the exercise of such powers</b></u>, as measured through the yardstick of academic freedom.<br><br>It must not be lost on the Court that the exercise by the LEB of its powers under the aforesaid law, including its exercise of control over the law schools' operations, the qualifications of the deans and professors, and especially the curriculum, are even more intrusive and invasive than the PhiLSAT, which only deals with admission to law school. Therefore, it would be a wasted opportunity for the Court to adopt a short-sighted approach and shirk away from delving into the constitutionality of the other powers and acts of the LEB, especially considering that, as extensively shown herein, the LEB's exercise of these powers is punctuated by blatant violations of academic freedom. The Court's ruling in <i>Pimentel Jr. v. Hon. Aguirre</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> teaches:<br><blockquote>x x x By the <b><u>mere enactment</u></b> of the questioned law or the <b><u>approval of the challenged action</u></b>, the dispute is said to have ripened into a judicial controversy even without any other overt act. Indeed, even a singular violation of the Constitution and/or the law is enough to awaken judicial duty. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>By the same token, when an act of the President, who in our constitutional scheme is a coequal of Congress, is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution and the laws, as in the present case, settling the dispute becomes the duty and the responsibility of the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>I submit that the Court not only has the opportunity but, in fact, the duty to settle the disputes given the serious allegations of infringement of the Constitution. The Court should thus not foster lingering or recurring litigation as this case already presents the opportune time to rule on the constitutionality of the LEB's statutory powers and how the LEB exercises the same. Hence, I maintain that the Court's disposition of the instant case should not be unduly restricted to only the question of the PhiLSAT's constitutionality.<br><br>For ease of reference, quoted below are the functions and powers of the LEB under R.A. 7662:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Powers and Functions</i>. - For the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Act, the Board shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>a) to administer the legal education system in the country in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Act[;]<br><br>b) to supervise the law schools in the country, consistent with its powers and functions as herein enumerated;<br><br>c) to set the standards of accreditation for law schools taking into account, among others, the size of enrollment, the qualifications of the members of the faculty, the library and other facilities, without encroaching upon the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning;<br><br>d) to accredit law schools that meet the standards of accreditation;<br><br>e) to prescribe minimum standards for law admission and minimum qualifications and compensation of faculty members;<br><br>f) to prescribe the basic curricula for the course of study aligned to the requirements for admission to the Bar, law practice and social consciousness, and such other courses of study as may be prescribed by the law schools and colleges under the different levels of accreditation status;<br><br>g) to establish a law practice internship as a requirement for taking the Bar which a law student shall undergo with any duly accredited private or public law office or firm or legal assistance group anytime during the law course for a specific period that the Board may decide, but not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months.

As a result, I have identified several other LEB issuances beyond those identified by the <i>ponencia</i> which are arbitrary and unreasonable, and thus null and void.<br><br><i>A. Issues on Academic Freedom</i><br><br>The guarantee of academic freedom is enshrined in Section 5(2), Article XIV of the Constitution, which states that: "[a]cademic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning." This institutional academic freedom includes "the right of the school or college to decide for itself, its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The essential freedoms subsumed in the term "academic freedom" are: 1) who may teach; 2) what may be taught; 3) how it shall be taught; and 4) who may be admitted to study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the Constitution also recognizes the State's power to regulate educational institutions. Section 4(1), Article XIV of the Constitution provides that: "[t]he State recognizes the complementary roles of public and private institutions in the educational system and shall exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions." As gleaned from the quoted provision, the State's power to regulate is subject to the requirement of <i>reasonableness</i>.<br><br>The limitation on the State's power to regulate was introduced in the 1987 Constitution. Under the 1973 Constitution, it only states that "[a]ll educational institutions shall be under the supervision of, and subject to regulation by, the State."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The framers of the current Constitution saw the need to add the word "reasonable" before the phrase "supervision and regulation" in order to qualify the State's power over educational institutions. This is extant from the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission on August 29, 1986:<br><blockquote>MR. GUINGONA. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>When we speak of <b>State supervision and regulation, we refer to the <u>external governance of educational institutions</u>, particularly private educational institutions as distinguished from the internal governance by their respective boards of directors or trustees and their administrative officials</b>. Even without a provision on external governance, the State would still have the inherent right to regulate educational institutions through the exercise of its police power. <u><b>We have thought it advisable to restate the supervisory and regulatory functions of the State provided in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions with the addition of the word "reasonable." We found it necessary to add the word "reasonable"</b></u> because of an <i>obiter dictum</i> of our Supreme Court in a decision in the case of <i>Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities vs. The Secretary of Education and the Board of Textbooks</i> in 1955. In that case, the court said, and I quote:<br><blockquote>It is enough to point out that local educators and writers think the Constitution provides for control of education by the State.<br><br>The Solicitor General cites many authorities to show that the power to regulate means power to control, and quotes from the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention to prove that State control of private education was intended by organic law.<br></blockquote><b>The addition, therefore, of the word "reasonable" is meant to underscore the sense of the committee, that when the Constitution speaks of State supervision and regulation, <u>it does not in any way mean control</u>. We refer only to the power of the State to provide regulations and to see to it that these regulations are duly followed and implemented. <u>It does not include the right to manage, dictate, overrule and prohibit.</u> Therefore, it <u>does not include the right to dominate</u>.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Delegate Clemente, chairman of the 1973 Constitutional Convention's Committee on Education, has this to say about supervision and regulation, and I quote:<br><blockquote>While we are agreed that we need some kind of supervision and regulation by the State, there seems to be a prevailing notion among some sectors in education that <u>there is too much interference of the State in the management of private education. If that is true, we need some kind of re-examination of this function of the State to supervise and regulate education because we are all agreed that there must be some kind of diversity, as well as flexibility, in the management of private education</u>.

MAAMBONG. What I am trying to say is that we have bogged down in this discussion because we do not see how we can reconcile a concept of state regulation and supervision with the concept of academic freedom.<br><br>MR. GASCON. <b>When we speak of state regulation and supervision, that <u>does not mean dictation</u></b>, because we have already defined what education is. Hence, in the pursuit of knowledge in schools we should provide the educational institution as much academic freedom as it needs. <b>When we speak of regulation, we speak of guidelines and others. <u>We do not believe that the State has any right to impose its ideas on the educational institution because that would already be a violation of their constitutional rights.</u></b><br><br><b><u>There is no conflict between our perspectives.</u> When we speak of regulations, we speak of providing guidelines and cooperation in as far as defining curricula, et cetera, <u>but that does not give any mandate to the State to impose its ideas on the educational institution</u>.</b> That is what academic freedom is all about.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>In sum, <u><b>"reasonable supervision and regulation" by the State over educational institutions does not include the power to control, manage, dictate, overrule, prohibit, and dominate</b></u>.<br><br>As applied to the instant case, in order to determine whether the LEB's functions violate the academic freedom of law schools, it must be ascertained whether the LEB's discharge of its functions is reasonable.<br><br>However, a review of the issuances of the LEB (<i>i.e.</i>, memorandum orders, memorandum circulars and resolutions), <u><b>of which this Court can take judicial notice</b></u>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and in which there are no factual questions, reveals that the LEB has gone beyond its powers of reasonable supervision and regulation of the law schools. Dean Sedfrey M. Candelaria (Dean Candelaria), as <i>amicus curiae</i> for this case, expressed a similar view in his <i>Amicus Brief</i> "[i]t is my considered view that a number of LEB issuances may have overstepped the limits of its jurisdiction, powers and functions.

To illustrate:<br><br><i>First</i>. In the guise of accreditation, the LEB has gravely abused its minimal supervisorial authority by requiring as part of an institution's application for a permit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to operate: a) "a copy of the roster of its administrative officials, including the members of the Board of Trustees or Directors,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> b) "a roster of its faculty members for the proposed law school, x x x [including] the <u>academic credentials and personal data sheets of the dean and of the faculty members</u>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> c) "the present library holdings for law as well as the name and <u>qualifications of the law librarian</u>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and, quite ridiculously, d) "<u>pictures of [, among others, the] dean's office, and faculty lounge of the law school</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Under LEB Memorandum Order No. 1, Series of 2011 (LEBMO No. 1-2011), the application for a permit to operate may be denied upon evaluation and ocular inspection,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> if the LEB finds that the law program is "substandard in the quality of its operation[,] x x x when surrounding circumstances make it very difficult for it to form a <u>suitable</u> faculty or for any valid and weighty reasons, the proposed law school could not possibly deliver quality legal education."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The foregoing grounds for denial of an application to operate under LEBMO No. 1-2011 are not only vague and arbitrary but worse, blatantly violative of an institution's academic freedom. By insisting that it can review 1) the "suitability" of the faculty and personnel through the submission of their academic credentials and personal data sheets, and 2) the "quality" of a school's operations through an evaluation of an institution's library holdings and faculty facilities, <u><b>the LEB has unreasonably interfered with an institution's right to select its faculty and staff and to determine the facilities and benefits that will be made available for their use</b></u>.<br><br><i>Second</i>. Again in the guise of accreditation, the LEB overreached its mandate anew by authorizing itself to interview<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the dean and faculty members of schools applying for recognition status<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in order for it to determine whether "its students are prepared for the last year of the law curriculum, and that the professors who are to teach review subjects are prepared for the last year of the law course."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This requirement is so unreasonable that if an institution undergoing accreditation is found deficient, recognition may be denied and the law school may be closed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>LEB Memorandum Order No.2, Series of 2013 (LEBMO No. 2-2013) likewise provides that law schools that have a "<u>weak faculty</u>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "inadequate library research facilities,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> "no faculty syllabus,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> "no moot court room,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and "no faculty lounge,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> as determined by the LEB, shall be considered "substandard,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and shall be "unfit to continue operating a law program."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The LEB's supposed authority to review 1) an individual faculty member's ability to teach and 2) the strength or weakness of the faculty as a whole, is not only presumptuous but is a gross violation of an institution's right to set academic standards and procedures for evaluating the qualifications and performance of its own educators.<br><br>Third. In gross violation of an institution's right to select "who may teach," the LEB has also imposed the requirement that the members of the faculty, in addition to their respective law degrees and Bar memberships, must likewise possess Masters of Law degrees (LLM). LEBMO No. 1-2011 pertinently provides:<br><blockquote><b><i>Section 50.</i></b> The members of the <u>faculty of a law school should, at the very least, possess a Ll.B. or a J.D. degree</u> and should <u>be members of the Philippine Bar</u>.

More importantly, the requirement is arbitrary and miserably fails to take into account the distinct nature of the legal profession, <i>i.e.</i>, that legal expertise is not necessarily developed or acquired only through further studies but also (<u><b>or more so</b></u>) through constant and continuous law practice in various specialized fields.<br><br>Under the foregoing rule, a seasoned law practitioner with 10 or 20 years of experience from an established law firm will not be qualified to teach in a law school without an LLM, unless he or she is able to prove to the LEB (not to the institution) that he or she is an expert in the subject he or she seeks to teach. This does not only prejudice the institution, but more so the law student who is, by LEB fiat, senselessly deprived of the opportunity to learn from the wisdom of experience. The significance of actual law practice vis-a-vis law study is highlighted by the fact that a minimum number of years in the former is required as a qualification for appointment as a judge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In contrast, an LLM degree is not even required for members of the Court.<br><br>The LEB also failed to consider that 1) LLM programs impose onerous financial/time constraints and opportunity costs on incumbent or potential faculty members, 2) few schools in the Philippines offer LLM programs, and 3) LLM programs abroad teaching foreign laws do not necessarily augment legal expertise, knowledge, and experience in Philippine law. As Dean Candelaria accurately noted in his <i>Amicus Brief</i>, "[t]he mandatory requirement of graduate degrees in law for deans and faculty members under LEB policies, while laudable and ideal, may not be easily realizable in light of the practical difficulties in accessing and maintaining enrollment in graduate programs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Upon being asked during the oral arguments to expound on this matter, Dean Candelaria elucidated as follows:<br><blockquote><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CAGUIOA:</b><br>Okay, on page seven (7) of your Brief, you mentioned that the master's requirement while laudable, may not be easily realizable in light of the practical difficulties in accessing and maintaining enrollment in graduate programs. Can you inform the Court exactly what [these] practical difficulties are?<br><br><b>DEAN CANDELARIA:</b><br>Your Honor, I teach at least in two (2) schools where there is graduate degree being offered, the Ateneo and San Beda Graduate School of Law with the consortium with the academy, and I have seen the difficulties in particular, for instance, for sitting deans or faculty members, to appropriate the time to actually access the centers for learning, because we don't have as much presence, perhaps, in the Visayas or Mindan[a]o. And of course, we have to ad[a]pt now, because some schools now are going out there, like Ateneo De Naga, has actually requested on-site the offerings. So, difficulties really abound insofar as remote areas are concerned. Manila is not so much problematic, for those who teach in Manila. But for those who would have to fly, from Samar, I know I have a student from Samar, from Mindanao, who would tranche a weekend curriculum, let's say at San Beda . . .<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CAGUIOA:</b><br>So, in other words, Dean, what you are saying is that, as an example, the physical location or the topography of the area is such that, insisting on this requirement would be a grave prejudice to these other law schools because they cannot, in fact, access further higher learning to comply with the requirements of [the] LEB.<br><br><b>DEAN CANDELARIA:</b><br>At this stage, Your Honor, as the lack of institutions is really evident, I think we may have to work on this progressively in the near future. With the cooperation of the Bench, the Bar, the Association of Law Schools, and also the Philippine Association of Law Professors, to be able to achieve that goal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>Undoubtedly, the LEB overreaches its authority in requiring an LLM as a "minimum qualification." <b>In imposing the foregoing requirement, the LEB arbitrarily usurped an institution's academic authority to gauge and to evaluate the qualifications of its educators on an individual basis, and hastily reduced the pool of expertise available for selection - to the detriment of the institution, the faculty, the students, and the profession as a whole.</b><br><br><i>Fourth</i>. The same observations may be made about the qualifications imposed on deans of law schools and graduate law schools, who are required to possess a Master's or Doctorate Degree, respectively. LEBMO No. 1-2011 states:<br><blockquote><b><i>Section 51.</i></b> The dean should have, aside from complying with the requirements above, <u>at least a Master of Laws (Ll.M.) degree or a master's degree in a related field, and should have been a Member of the Bar for at least 5 years prior to his appointment as dean</u>.<br><br><b><i>Section 52.</i></b> The dean of a graduate school of law should possess at least <u>a doctorate degree in law</u> and should be an <u>acknowledged authority in law, as evidenced by publications and membership in learned societies and organizations; members of the faculty of a graduate school of law should possess at least a Master of Laws (Ll.M.) degree or the relevant master's or doctor's degrees in related fields</u>.<br><br>Aside from the foregoing, <u>retired justices of the Supreme Court</u>, the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals may serve as deans of schools of law, provided that they <u>have had teaching experience as professors of law and provided further that, with the approval of the Legal Education Board, a graduate school of law may accredit their experience in the collegiate appellate courts and the judgments they have penned towards the degree ad eundem of Master of Laws</u>. (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The unreasonableness of the foregoing provisions is exemplified by the fact that deans are primarily "school administrators." While certainly, many legal luminaries have occupied, and currently occupy, the position of dean, there is no justifiable reason to absolutely require (rather than encourage or recommend) an LLM (for law deans) and Doctorate Degree (for graduate law deans), when the same would not necessarily improve the management or administration of a law institution. <u><b>On the other hand, if legal scholarship and authority were to be made the standard, it is peculiar that even a retired Member of the Court would prove unfit, unless otherwise approved by the members of the LEB.</b></u><br><br>Notably, the members of the LEB - while seeing it fit to impose arbitrary requirements to gauge the suitability of faculty members, and to evaluate the strength or weakness of the faculty as a whole - are themselves not subjected to the same educational qualifications. As pointed out by Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen during the oral arguments:<br><blockquote><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br>Excuse me, for a moment, you are requiring from all Deans, which you supervise, [and] law professors that they have an advanced degree, yet the LEB does not have an advanced degree, how do you explain this?<br><br><b>[MR.] AQUENDE:</b><br>Your Honor, the justification or the rationale that was prepared by the previous Board because it was not approved during our term, the previous Board looked into the function of the LEB and which is not academic in nature, Your Honor.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>JUSTICE LEONEN:</b><br>And in LEB, maybe, even perhaps, you should take care first that the LEB members are all, at minimum, have masteral degrees from reputable law schools here or abroad or a doctoral degree for that matter before you apply it to your constituents, but my point is, isn't that unreasonable x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x that you require deans to take an advance[d] degree x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In other words, you imposed an educational requirement on law schools and certainly according to our jurisprudence, who to teach is an academic matter?

While presumably imposed for the benefit of the students and the professor, the imposition of the foregoing is better left to the individual institution which would be in a better position to determine the needs and capacities of its students and its faculty.<br><br>To reiterate, academic institutions are free to select their faculty, to fix their qualifications, to evaluate their performance, and to determine their ranks, positions, and teaching loads. The LEB's purported power to prescribe <i>minimum</i> qualifications and compensation of faculty members should be construed to cover only minimal state interference when some important public interest calls for the exercise of reasonable supervision. <b>It does <u><i>not</i></u> include a blanket authority <u>to impose trivial rules as it sees fit</u>.

An academic institution should be given the necessary independence to identify, design and establish the courses and subjects that it deems crucial to a student's personal and professional development and what it believes will best reflect and inculcate its fundamental academic values.

I'll give you an example concretely. When I took Administrative Law, it was offered with Public Corporation, I think it was also with Election Law, and Public Officers. That has been the experience for a long time. In more recent times, there had been splits by the Legal Education Board, and the problem that students who have taken it, or who are about to take it for instance, would be displaced in terms of the ladder of courses that they will take. So, we've had students who have had tenure problems, because they have to take one which, at that time, was actually not offered so, there is an administrative problem imputing the number of units, that's one concrete problem. On faculty for instance, the assignment, there have been changes when it comes to faculty assignments and I think the problem with many law schools also, is hiring. Faculty members who may have to teach new courses also that are now being required by the Legal Education Board. I think for instance, Environmental Law. I know Environmental Law is booming in this country, there is a roster of lawyers right now who have gone into Environmental Law. But there are other subjects, of course, that are being introduced that may really be not, I think, easily taught by incumbent faculty members. <u><b>And the last one is tuition rates.

On the dangers of having the State actually prescribe what may be taught in educational institutions of higher learning, the Constitutional Commissioners had this to say:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS. <b>What I am concerned about, and I am sure the committee is concerned about also, is <u>the danger always of the State prescribing subjects</u>.</b> I recall that when the sponsor was the dean of Arts and Sciences in La Salle, his association of private school deans was precisely fighting the various prescriptions imposed by the State - that the schools must teach this, must teach that. Are we opening that up here?<br><br>MR. VILLACORTA. The Commissioner is right in describing these as guidelines. This is not to say that there will be specific subjects that will embody these principles on a one to-one correspondence. In other words, we are not saying that there should be a subject called nationalism or ecology. That was what we were fighting against in the Association of Philippine Colleges of Arts and Sciences. The government always came up with what they called thrusts, and therefore the corresponding subjects imposed on schools that are supposed to embody these thrusts. So, we had current issues. It was a course that was required on the tertiary level. Then there was a time when they required subjects that dealt with green revolution; and then agrarian reform. Taxation is in fact still a required course. <u>We are not thinking in those terms. These are merely guidelines.</u><br><br>FR. BERNAS. <b>In other words, while the State will give the goals and guidelines, as it were, how these are to be attained is to be determined by the institution by virtue of its academic freedom.</b><br><br>MR. VILLACORTA. That is right, Mr. Presiding Officer. I invite, of course, my fellow members in the committee who might have some reservations on the points I raised.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. But I guess what I am trying to point out is: Are we really serious about academic freedom?<br><br>MR. VILLACORTA. Definitely, we are. Would the Commissioner have certain misgivings about the way we defined it?<br><br>FR. BERNAS. I would, <b>if the committee goes beyond mere guidelines, because if we allow the State to start dictating what subjects should be taught and how these would be taught, I think it would be very harmful for the educational system</b>. Usually, legislation is done by legislators who are not educators and who know very little about education. <u>Perhaps education should be left largely to educators, with certain supervision, and so forth.</u><br><br>MR. VILLACORTA. Excuse me, Mr. Presiding Officer, if I may interject. I am sure the Honorable Bernas, being very much experienced in education, is aware of the fact that there is this great need to develop certain priority concerns in the molding of our youths' mind and behavior. For example, love of country is something that is very lacking in our society and I wonder if the Honorable Bernas would have any reservation against giving emphasis to nationalism.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. I have nothing against motherhood concepts, Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>MR. VILLACORTA. But this is always the dilemma of educators. To what extent do we give freedom as to the subject matter and manner of teaching versus certain imperatives of national development? In the last dispensation, we found a lopsided importance given to so-called national development which turned out to be just serving the interest of the leadership. The other members of the committee are fully aware of the dangers inherent in the State spelling out the priorities in education, but at the same time, we cannot overlook the fact that there are certain areas which must be emphasized in a developing society. Of course, we would wish that we shall not always be a developing society bereft of economic development as well as national unity. But we like the advise of the Honorable Bernas, as well as our colleagues in the Commission, on how we can constitutionalize certain priorities in educational development as well as curricular development without infringing necessarily on the goals of academic freedom. Moreover, jurisprudence accords academic freedom only to institutions of higher learning.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. So, I am quite satisfied that <u><b>these are guidelines</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>In sum, the LEB's authority to prescribe the "basic curricula" is limited by the Constitutional right of law schools to academic freedom and to the due process standard of reasonableness. When the LEB (or any branch of government for that matter) interferes with Constitutional rights and freedoms and overreaches its authority, <u><b>as it has done in this case</b></u>, it is the Court's Constitutional duty to make it tow the line.<br><br><i>iii. How to teach</i><br><br>As regards the aspect of academic freedom on <i>how to teach</i>, several issuances of the LEB readily reveal that, over the years, the LEB has exercised considerable power in <i>controlling</i>, and not merely recommending or supervising, the manner by which legal education institutions and law school professors conduct the teaching of law courses.<br><br>To cite a concrete example of how the LEB interferes with the law schools' right to determine the manner of instruction, the LEB issued LEBMO No. 1-2011, which, as earlier discussed, introduced policies and standards of legal education and provided for a manual of regulations for law schools. <u><b>The said LEBMO is riddled with various rules, regulations, and restrictions that go into the manner by which law schools teach their students.</b></u><br><br>For instance, according to Section 18(a) of LEBMO No. 1-2011, with respect to the LLB curriculum, the LEB requires law schools to complete the teaching of all subjects in the LLB curriculum within the entire semester as prescribed by the model curriculum provided in the LEBMO. Law schools are prohibited from completing the curriculum in <i>modular fashion, i.e.</i>, completing the subject by a class held continuously for a number of days, although satisfying the required number of hours. Evidently, the manner by which the law schools implement its curriculum is restricted.<br><br>The said provision also prohibits distance education, unless otherwise provided for by the LEB. For instance, if a law school professor wishes to conduct class through a video teleconference when he/she is, temporarily outside of the country, because LEBMO No. 1-2011 prohibits distance education unless approved by the LEB, the professor cannot do so. Clearly, this illustrates how the LEB interferes with the professors' prerogative to determine what methods they will employ in teaching their respective classes.<br><br>Further, under Section 18(c), the LEB imposes the total number of credits that shall be awarded to a student pursuing his/her LLM, as well as the specific number of units to be credited upon a successful defense before a Panel of Oral Examiners. The said provision also dictates upon the law school the specific type of output that a student must submit in a non-thesis master's program. Similarly, under Section 18(d), the issuance not only determines the minimum academic credits as regards the degree of SID or DCL; even the specific number of pages of a doctoral dissertation is imposed, <i>i.e.</i>, 200 pages. In fact, under Section 20 of the same issuance, legal education institutions are mandated to utilize internet access and to put up a Moot Court room in the process of teaching their students.<br><br>With respect to assessing the respective faculties of the law schools, under Section 41.2 of the issuance, the LEB is allowed to revoke the permits or recognitions given to legal education institutions when the LEB deems that there is gross incompetence on the part of the dean and the corps of professors or instructors. Simply stated, under the issuance, the LEB is permitted to assess the teaching performance of law school faculty members and mete out penalties in line with such assessment. The evaluation of the performance and competence of faculty members is part and parcel of a law school's right to determine its own manner of instruction. <u><b>Worse, the said issuance is silent as to how the LEB gauges gross incompetence.</b></u><br><br>As discussed earlier, under Section 58 of LEBMO No. 1-2011, the LEB prescribes course specifications, wherein the names of the courses, the number of units per course, the number of hours to be spent per week, and the various methods of instruction that must be utilized are dictated upon the legal education institution and the law school professors who teach the various courses indicated therein.<br><br>As a glaring example, under Section 58.1 of the aforesaid issuance, on the course of <i>Persons and Family Relations</i> in the LLB program, the instructor is specifically required to conduct "[c]ases, recitations and lectures" for 4 hours a week. For <i>Legal Technique and Logic</i>, on the other hand, the teaching methods prescribed are limited to "[r]ecitations and lectures" only, for 2 hours per week. Does this mean that professors who teach <i>Persons and Family Relations and Legal Technique and Logic</i> are discouraged, or worse, prohibited, to require group work or group presentations in their respective classes, considering that these methods of instruction were not included in the course specifications? That seems to be the case, based on a reading of the said issuance.<br><br>To stress, as clearly illustrated in the foregoing examples, the LEB, through LEBMO No. 1-2011, <u><b>dictates with much particularity and, therefore, unduly restricts</b></u> the method of teaching that may be adopted by the law school professors. This does not merely encroach on the academic freedom of the legal education institutions as to how to teach; the academic freedom of the faculty members themselves is directly infringed.<br><br>It must equally be stressed that the imposition of the course specifications provided under LEBMO No. 1-2011 is not merely recommendatory. It is <i>mandatory</i> in nature, considering that under Section 58 of the issuance, the law schools may provide their own course descriptions <i>only</i> when the same are not provided under the issuance and if in conformity with the subject titles stated in the model curricula provided in the issuance.<br><br>Astonishingly, under Section 59 of LEBMO No. 1-2011, the LEB even imposes specific rules and regulations on the manner by which the law schools grade its students. Law schools are even required to submit their grading system and a complete explanation thereof before the LEB.<br><br>To further illustrate how the LEB meddles with the right of the law schools to determine their own grading system, Section 59(a) specifies certain factors that must be considered by the law school professor in determining the student's final grade, <i>i.e.</i>, "[p]articipation in class through recitation, exchange of ideas, presentation of reports, and group discussion."<br><br>Under Section 59(b), law schools are forced to drop students who incur absences totaling 20% of the total number of contact hours or required hours (units) for the subject. Worse, law schools are required to inscribe the entry "FA" (Failed due to Absences) in the student's official transcript of records.<br><br>Section 59(d), on the other hand, interferes with the law schools' management of their respective apprenticeship programs. Under the said provision, when apprenticeship is required by the law school and the student does not complete the mandated number of apprenticeship hours, or the person supervising the apprenticeship program deems the performance of the student unsatisfactory, the law school dean is forced to "require of the student such number of hours more in apprenticeship as will fulfill the purposes of the apprenticeship program."<br><br>Also, under Section 59(e), when a program requires the submission and defense of a thesis, in a situation where a student fails to submit or receives a failing grade, the issuance directs law schools to allow students to "improve, correct or change the thesis and present it anew for the evaluation of the law school, through its dean or the professor assigned to direct thesis-writing." It is readily apparent that the very manner by which legal education institutions conduct their thesis program is interfered with.<br><br>Beyond LEBMO No. 1-2011, various rules and regulations that interfere in the legal education institutions' right to determine their manner of teaching are likewise found in LEBMO No. 2-2013.<br><br>In the said issuance, the LEB imposes several restrictions as to the allowable load of students in the law schools. As previously discussed, under Section 4 of LEBMO No. 2-2013, students are not permitted to take any advanced subject until passing prerequisite subjects. Further, under Section 5, the LEB sets the maximum number of academic units in excess of the normal load that may be allowed for graduating students, <i>i.e.</i>, six units. Under Sections 6 and 8, the requirements for the cross enrollment and transfer of students from one law school to another, respectively, are imposed.<br><br><b>Several impositions are also made even on the most miniscule of details regarding the request, transfer, and release of school records and transfer credentials.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><b> Interestingly, even the <u><i>format</i></u> of the school records is forced upon the law schools, as found in Section 7</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><b> of the issuance. Under Section 12, the rules on denial of final examinations, withholding of grades, and refusal to re-enroll are likewise dictated upon the legal education institutions.</b><br><br>Under Section 14 of LEBMO No. 2-2013, which mirrors Section 59(b) of LEBMO No. 1-2011, the LEB requires that professors fail students who incur absences of more than 20% of the prescribed number of class hours. This provision is a clear example of how the LEB directly interferes with the law professors' freedom to manage their respective classes.<br><br>LEBMO No. 2-2013 even imposes upon the legal education institutions the manner by which they should conduct their respective apprenticeship programs, determining the list of specific activities that should be required for students undergoing the apprenticeship programs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>As regards the law schools' right to determine which of their students are eligible to graduate, Section 16 of the issuance imposes residency requirements for graduation, establishing the rule that no student shall be allowed to graduate from any law school where he or she has not established academic residency for at least the two last semesters of his or her course of study. In fact, to further underscore the high level of interference and overreach exercised by the LEB, LEBMO No. 2-2013 even imposes upon the law schools certain rules on determining which students may participate in the commencement exercise of the law schools.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The interference of the LEB with the manner by which law schools implement their curriculum is so pervasive that, under LEBMO No. 2-2013, in order for a law school to open another branch<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> or hold extension classes,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> prior approval of the LEB is required.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Aside from the foregoing provisions of the LEBMO, I invite the Court's attention to Article III of the said issuance, which imposes numerous restrictions on <i>the power of law schools to maintain discipline and to determine the manner by which they conduct administrative proceedings</i>.<br><br>For example, under Section 20, the LEB forces upon law schools certain rules on when and how they can preventively suspend, suspend, expel, and not readmit their students.<br><br>The law school may only preventively suspend a student "when the evidence of guilt is strong and the Dean is morally convinced that the continued stay of the student pending investigation would cause sufficient distraction to the normal operations of the law school, or would pose real or imminent threat or danger to persons and property inside the law school's premises."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>If the law school decides to suspend a student, its action constrained to denying the erring student from attending classes for a period not exceeding 20% of the prescribed total class days for the school term.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>With respect to the penalty of non-readmission, when meeting out the said penalty, the law school is forced to allow the student to complete the current school term when the resolution for non-readmission was promulgated. The law school is likewise mandated to issue the transfer credentials of the erring student upon promulgation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>As regards the penalty of exclusion, the LEB allows the law schools to mete out such penalty "for acts or offenses such as dishonesty, hazing that involves physical, moral or psychological violence that does not result in death of a student, carrying deadly weapons, immorality, selling and/or possession of prohibited drugs, drug dependency, drunkenness, hooliganism, vandalism and other offenses analogous to the foregoing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>The said issuance also confines the power of law schools to expel a student. Under LEBMO No. 2-2013, the permissible instances when law schools can expel a student are limited to (a) participation of a student as a principal in a fraternity hazing that results in the death of a law student; (b) unlawful physical assault of higher education institution officials inside the school campus; and (c) commission of an offense with an imposable minimum penalty of more than 12 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Hence, based on this provision, if a student participates in a fraternity hazing wherein the death of a non-law student occurs, absurdly, the law school has no power to expel a student.<br><br>Further, in cases wherein the administrative charge filed against a student amounts to a criminal offense, Section 22 of the LEBMO requires law schools to proceed with the administrative proceedings until termination even if the criminal case has not yet been decided by the court.<br><br>Notably, under Section 19 of LEBMO No. 2-2013, if the law school imposes a sanction of expulsion against a student, the student may appeal the disciplinary action meted out by the school before the LEB. <b><u>The latter is empowered under the LEBMO to <i>reverse and set aside</i> the school's decision to expel the student.</u></b> Without a shred of doubt, this is a clear derogation of the law school's right to discipline its students.<br><br>It must be emphasized that the right of the school to discipline its students is an integral aspect of the academic freedom of how to teach.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Because the schools' power to instill discipline in their students is subsumed in their academic freedom, the Court has generally adopted a stance of deference and non-interference, declining to meddle with the right of schools to impose disciplinary sanctions, which includes the power to dismiss or expel, students who violate disciplinary rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> In fact, the power of schools to discipline their students is so established and recognized that, in our jurisprudence, even the power to impose disciplinary measures has extended to schools even after graduation for any act done by the student prior thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br><u><b>Hence, the various rules imposed by the LEB that control and unduly restrict the law schools' determination of the manner by which they discipline their students undoubtedly amount to a serious breach of their academic freedom to determine how to teach.</b></u><br><br>Another exemplar of the LEB's unwarranted and undue interference in the law schools' prerogative to control the manner of instruction is LEB Memorandum Order No. 10, Series of 2017 (LEBMO No. 10-2017), which imposes guidelines on the adoption of the academic/school calendar. While the said LEBMO allows law schools to establish their own academic/school calendars and set their own opening dates, it nevertheless restrictively confines the academic/school calendar to no less than 36 weeks, wherein the total number of days shall not be less than 200 per calendar year. Moreover, the issuance requires law schools to set the start of their school calendar not earlier than the last week of May, but not later than the last day of August. The law schools' discretion to determine the amount of weeks and days in their academic/school calendars, as well as the period of commencement of the academic year, is clipped.<br><br>The aforementioned issuances and their provisions are but examples of how the LEB has exercised the power of control - not supervision - over the legal education institutions' rights to determine the manner by which law courses are taught and how such institutions manage their internal affairs.<br><br><i>iv. Who may be admitted</i><br><br>With respect to the academic freedom aspect of who may be admitted to the schools, I reiterate my position that the <i>ponencia</i> is correct in holding that the PhiLSAT is violative of academic freedom. Mandating legal education institutions to reject examinees who failed to obtain the prescribed passing score amounts to a <i>complete transfer of control</i> over student admissions from the law schools to the LEB. To emphasize, the permissible power of the State over institutions of higher learning is limited to supervision and regulation, <i>not control</i>.<br><br>Beyond the PhiLSAT, however, the LEB has imposed other restrictions that similarly interfere with the law school's right to determine who to admit and teach.<br><br>Under LEBMO No. 1-2011, where the applicant for admission into a law school is a graduate of a foreign institution, instead of allowing the law schools to determine for themselves whether to admit the student or not, the matter is referred exclusively to the LEB, who shall determine the eligibility of the candidate for admission to law school.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Hence, under the LEBMO, the LEB is given complete control and discretion as to the admissions of foreign graduates. This is a clear derogation of the right of law schools to determine who to admit.<br><br>Further, under Section 16 of the same LEBMO, the LEB forces law schools to reject applicants for admission to the LLB or JD program of studies who failed to earn at least 18 units in English, 6 units in Mathematics, and 18 units of social science subjects. <u><b>Such requirement has no basis under the Rules of Court or under any law.</b></u> The aforesaid requirement is purely the creation of the LEB. The same may be said with respect to the rules on the prerequisites for admission to graduate programs in law imposed under Section 17.<br><br><i>B. Other Issues Under the LEB Law</i><br><br><i>i.

Thus, the LEB declared a 3 year moratorium on opening of new law schools.<br><br>This unilateral declaration, <u><b>which is merely based on the LEB's opinion</b></u>, seems to have been undertaken without consultation with stakeholders, specifically the law schools, which the LEB plans to inspect and monitor.<br><br></li><li>LEB Resolution No. 16, Series of 2011 (LEB Resolution 16-2011)­ The LEB considers a small student population in a law school as not financially viable and would result in "substandard legal education," unless subsidized by the management.

R.A. 7662's provision on law practice internship</i><br><br>With regard to the provision in R.A. 7662 empowering the LEB to impose an internship requirement as a prerequisite to take the Bar examinations, I agree with the <i>ponencia</i>'s ruling<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> that the said provision of law is unconstitutional on its face. Section 7(g) of R.A. 7662 provides that the LEB is granted the power:<br><blockquote>g) to establish a law practice internship as a requirement for taking the Bar which a law student shall undergo with any duly accredited private or public law office or firm or legal assistance group anytime during the law course for a specific period that the Board may decide, but not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months. For this purpose, the Board shall prescribe the necessary guidelines for such accreditation and the specifications of such internship which shall include the actual work of a new member of the Bar.</blockquote>To my mind, the <i>ponencia</i> correctly holds that the aforequoted provision encroaches on the power of the Supreme Court to prescribe the requirement for admission to the Bar as provided under Section 2 of Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Requirements for all applicants for admission to the bar</i>. - Every applicant for admission as a member of the bar must be a citizen of the Philippines, at least twenty-one years of age, of good moral character, and a resident of the Philippines; and must produce before the Supreme Court satisfactory evidence of good moral character, and that no charges against him, involving moral turpitude, have been filed or are pending in any court in the Philippines.</blockquote>In his <i>Amicus Brief</i>, Dean Candelaria also noted that some of the provisions of R.A. 7662 are in apparent conflict with the power of the Court to promulgate rules and that law practice internship and mandatory continuing legal education are both subjects of Court rules and issuances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, it is my view that the <i>ponencia</i> was justified in striking down the particular provision of R.A. 7662 for being unconstitutional.<br><br><i>Conclusion</i><br><br>To end, I reiterate my agreement with the <i>ponencia</i>'s conclusions for the reasons I have already discussed above.<br><br>Verily, after a meticulous review of the circulars, memorandum orders and other issuances of the LEB, it has become apparent that the LEB has committed acts of overreach, clearly going beyond mere supervision of law schools. A careful analysis of how the LEB exercised and continues to exercise its powers readily reveals that the LEB is already unduly interfering and meddling with the law schools' right to determine who may teach, what may be taught, how to teach and who may be admitted to study. As illustrated above, the exercise of the LEB's powers are evidently beyond <i>reasonable</i> supervision and regulation by the State.<br><br>Perhaps, if the various LEB rules and regulations cited here were merely recommendatory in nature or were mere guidelines (following the intent of the Constitutional Commissioners), then the exercise of the LEB's power could possibly pass constitutional muster. <u><b><i>However, this is not the case.</i></b></u> As seen from the discussion above, the many issuances of the LEB were imposed on the law schools under pain of administrative sanctions - which include the closing down of the law school for non-compliance. <b>The questionable issuances cited here show that the LEB is exercising the power to control, manage, dictate, overrule, prohibit and dominate the law schools - in absolute disregard of the Constitutional guarantee of academic freedom.</b> As such, the Court is called upon <u><b><i>in this case</i></b></u> to curb the abuse, and to strike down these issuances for being violative of the Constitutional right of the law schools to exercise academic freedom.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> in <b>PARTLY GRANTING</b> the petitions and in declaring the following:<br><blockquote>The jurisdiction of the Legal Education Board over legal education is <b>UPHELD</b>.<br><br>The Court further declares: <br><br>As <b>CONSTITUTIONAL</b>:<br><ol><li>Section 7(c) of R.A.

In addition, I wish to highlight certain important matters that were not mentioned in the <i>ponencia</i>.<br><br><b><i>The Importance of Education in the Philippine Setting</i></b><br><br>Education is a continuing concern that is impressed with public interest. The importance of education in our country is apparent from the numerous Constitutional provisions highlighting the obligation of the State to nurture and protect our educational systems, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>"<b>ARTICLE II. DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES AND STATE POLICIES PRINCIPLES</b><br><br>Article II, Section 17. The State shall give priority to education, science and technology, arts, culture, and sports to foster patriotism and nationalism, accelerate social progress, and promote total human liberation and development.<br><br><b>ARTICLE XIV. EDUCATION</b><br><br>Article XIV, Section 1. The State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education at all levels, and shall take appropriate steps to make such education accessible to all.<br><br>Article XIV, Section 2. The State shall:<br><br>1. Establish, maintain, and support a complete, adequate, and integrated system of education relevant to the needs of the people and society;<br><br>2. Establish and maintain, a system of free public education in the elementary and high school levels. Without limiting the natural rights of parents to rear their children, elementary education is compulsory for all children of school age;<br><br>3. Establish and maintain a system of scholarship grants, student loan programs, subsidies, and other incentives which shall be available to deserving students in both public and private schools, especially to the underprivileged;<br><br>4. Encourage non-formal, informal, and indigenous learning systems, as well as self-learning, independent, and out-of-school study programs particularly those that respond to community needs; and<br><br>5. Provide adult citizens, the disabled, and out-of-school youth with training in civics, vocational efficiency, and other skills.<br><br><i>Article XIV, Section 4</i>. The State recognizes the complementary roles of public and private institutions in the educational system and shall exercise reasonable supervision and regulation of all educational institutions."</blockquote>The common thread that runs through these Constitutional provisions is the State's priority towards education. This stems from the reality that "education and total human development [are] the gateway not only to intellectual and moral development but also to economic advancement and the cultivation of the yearning for freedom and justice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> It leads to the promotion of "total human liberation and development."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In view of the importance of education, the State is bound to protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality education, and to undertake steps to make it accessible and affordable for all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Added to this, all systems of education must be relevant to the needs of the people and the society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Pursuant thereto, on December 23, 1999, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7662 or the Legal Education Reform Act of 1993. The law was created to fulfill the State's policy to uplift the standards of legal education to prepare law students for advocacy, counseling, problem solving, and decision-making; to infuse in them the ethics of the legal profession and impress on them the importance and dignity of the legal profession as an equal and indispensable partner of the Bench.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> To achieve these ends, the lawmakers created a Legal Education Board ("LEB"), to pursue the following objectives, to wit:<br><blockquote>(a) to administer the legal education system in the country in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Act;<br><br>(b) to supervise the law schools in the country, consistent with its powers and functions as herein enumerated;<br><br>(c) to set the standards of accreditation for law schools taking into account, among others, the size of enrollment, the qualifications of the members of the faculty, the library and other facilities, without encroaching upon the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning;<br><br>(d) to accredit law schools that meet the standards of accreditation;<br><br><b>(e) to prescribe minimum standards for law admission and minimum qualifications and compensation of faculty members;</b><br><br>(f) to prescribe the basic curricula for the course of study aligned to the requirements for admission to the Bar, law practice and social consciousness, and such other courses of study as may be prescribed by the law schools and colleges under the different levels of accreditation status;<br><br>(g) to establish a law practice internship as a requirement for taking the Bar which a law student shall undergo with any duly accredited private or public law office or firm or legal assistance group anytime during the law course for a specific period that the Board may decide, but not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months. For this purpose, the Board shall prescribe the necessary guidelines for such accreditation and the specifications of such internship which shall include the actual work of a new member of the Bar.<br><br>(h) to adopt a system of continuing legal education. For this purpose, the Board may provide for the mandatory attendance of practicing lawyers in such courses and for such duration as the Board may deem necessary; and<br><br>(i) to perform such other functions and prescribe such rules and regulations necessary for the attainment of the policies and objectives of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Latching on to its power to prescribe the minimum standards for law admission, on December 29, 2016, the LEB released LEBMO No. 7, Series of 2016, which provides for the implementation of a nationwide uniform law school admission test - the PhilSAT. It is an aptitude exam that is designed to "measure the academic potential of the examinee to pursue the study of law," through a series of questions that gauge his/her proficiencies in communications, language, critical thinking, and verbal and quantitative reasoning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Under LEBMO No. 7, the PhilSAT shall be administered once a year on or before April 16 in Metro Manila, Baguio City, Legazpi City, Cebu City, Iloilo City, Davao City, and Cagayan de Oro City. A prospective test taker must pay a testing fee of Php 1,500.00 (later reduced to Php 1,000).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Basically, the PhilSAT intends to predict the capacity of the test taker to survive in a challenging legal education program. It is surmised that if the examinee obtains a grade of 55 and above, then he/she can surely endure the rigors of law school.<br><br>In addition, it is assumed that those who graduated with honors and have been granted a professional civil service eligibility possess the basic competencies to thrive in law school. As such, they are exempt from the requirement of taking the PhilSAT, provided that they enroll in a law school within two years from their college graduation, and obtain a Certificate of Exemption from the LEB.<br><br>On the part of the law schools, they are strictly enjoined from admitting an applicant who failed to obtain the minimum required score, or an honor graduate who neglected to submit the Certificate of Exemption. Any law school who violates this rule shall be subjected to administrative sanctions, ranging :from the termination or phasing-out of its lw program; provisional cancellation of its government recognition and placing of its law program under Permit Status, and/or paying a fine of not less than Php 10,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the LEB issued LEBMO No. 11, which provided for transitional provisions to LEBMO No. 7, allowing conditional admission and enrollment to those who failed to take the PhilSAT last April 16, 2017. The test takers' conditional enrollment was premised on an undertaking that they will take the next scheduled PhilSAT, and obtain the required minimum score, otherwise, their conditional admission shall be revoked.

However, this right is not unbridled, and is limited by the Constitutional admonition that said right must be exercised in a reasonable manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This means that the extent of State supervision and regulation may not transgress the cherished freedoms granted under the Constitution.<br><br><b><i>The PhilSAT is Violative of the Law Schools' Academic Freedom</i></b><br><br>Inasmuch as the State possesses the right to supervise and regulate educational institutions, the Constitution craftily ensures that the exercise thereof will not spiral into tyranny. To avoid any form of despotism in the regulation of institutions, the Constitution adds a layer of protection in favor of the academic institutions by ensuring that notwithstanding the possibility of state interference in their affairs, "[a]cademic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Law schools, as institutions of higher education, are the recipients of this boon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>This institutional autonomy granted unto universities has been in existence as early as the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Despite being strongly entrenched in our fundamental law, surprisingly, the body of jurisprudence on the matter of academic freedom is scarce. Noted Constitutionalist Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas, SJ theorizes that the scarcity stems from either a positive aspect - where occasions for litigation and controversy surrounding the matter are rare due to the unhampered freedom enjoyed by the academic world, or, in a negative aspect - due to a general ignorance or naivety regarding its meaning, purpose, and utility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The instant case is one of the rare occasions where the issue of academic freedom comes to fore, and thus, presents an opportunity for the Court to further elucidate its meaning.<br><br>Interestingly, academic freedom is an amorphous concept that eludes exact definition. The framers of the Constitution intended it to remain as expansive and dynamic, in a desire to give the courts a wide latitude to develop its meaning further, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In anticipation of the question as to whether and what aspects of academic freedom are included herein, ConCom Commissioner Adolfo S. Azcuna explained: "Since academic freedom is a dynamic concept, we want to expand the frontiers of freedom, especially in education, therefore, we shall leave it to the courts to develop further the parameters of academic freedom."<br><br>More to the point, Commissioner Jose Luis Martin C. Gascon asked: "When we speak of the sentence 'academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning,' do we mean that academic freedom shall be enjoyed by the institution itself?" Azcuna replied: "Not only that, it also includes . . . ." Gascon finished off the broken thought, ­ "the faculty and the students." Azcuna replied: "Yes."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>In Philippine jurisprudence, one of the earliest definitions of this term emerged from the case of <b><i>Garcia v. The Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology</i></b> where the Court held that "the internal conditions for academic freedom in a university are that the academic staff should have de facto control of the following functions: (i) admission and examination of students; (ii) the curricula for courses of study; (iii) the appointment and tenure of office of academic staff and (iv) the allocation of income among the different categories of expenditure."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the cases that followed, the parameters of academic freedom were simplified to pertain to a general liberty to decide (i) who may teach; (ii) who may be taught; (iii) how lessons shall be taught; and (iv) who may be admitted to study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Certainly, "[i]t is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation; x x x an atmosphere in which there prevail the 'four essential freedoms' of a university."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, insofar as the academic institution is concerned, it possesses the general right to determine not only the subject matter, or manner of teaching, but likewise has a free reign to select its own students. This liberty was described in <b><i>Garcia</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> as "a wide sphere of autonomy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, the school has the .right to decide its admission criteria for itself, in accordance with "its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them - free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Moreover, the Court nips in the bud any attempts to curtail or limit this freedom, warning that "[t]his constitutional provision [academic freedom] is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a grudging fashion. That would be to frustrate its purposes and nullify its intent."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>Ateneo de Manila University v. Judge Capulong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court went further by characterizing the right of the schools to choose their own students as "inherent," explaining that,<br><blockquote>"educational institutions of higher learning are <b>inherently</b> endowed with the right to establish their policies, academic and otherwise, unhampered by external controls or pressure. In the Frankfurter formulation, this is articulated in the areas of: (1) what shall be taught, e.g., the curriculum and (2) who may be admitted to study."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>Indeed, institutions of higher learning are inherently endowed with the right to establish their own policies - academic and otherwise, unhampered by external controls or pressure. This includes the creation of their own distinct policies, standards or criteria in the selection of their students, in accordance with their vision-mission and objectives. Remarkably, this prerogative is essential to their very functioning and identity. For sure, the schools' body politic serves as a representation of their standards, an embodiment of their vision, and a reflection of their ideals.<br><br>Equally important, in <i>University of San Agustin, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court stressed that concomitant to the right of the schools to pursue their academic freedom, are the duties to ensure that this freedom is not jeopardized,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and to staunchly avert any possible encroachments thereto. They must zealously guard their liberty against the State. Correlatively, on the part of the State, it should only interfere in instances where the public welfare necessitates its intrusion.<br><br>This idea was likewise evinced by the framers of the 1987 Constitution, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>MR. GASCON: When we speak of state regulation and supervision, that does not mean dictation, because we have already defined what education is. Hence, in the pursuit of knowledge in schools we should provide the educational institution as much academic freedom it needs. When we speak of regulation, we speak of guidelines and others. We do not believe that the State has any right to impose its ideas on the educational institution because that would already be a violation of their constitutional rights.<br><br>There is no conflict between our perspectives. When we speak of regulations, we speak of providing guidelines and cooperation in as far as defining curricular et cetera, but that does not give any mandate to the State to impose its ideas ·on the educational institution. That is what academic freedom is all about.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>In fact, even the legislative and executive branches of government protect this liberty. Particularly, under <i>Batas Pambansa</i> (B.P.) Blg. 232, as amended, the State affirms the objective of establishing and maintaining a complete, adequate and integrated system of education relevant to the goals of national development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Further, Section 13(2) of B.P. Blg. 232 recognizes that to achieve this goal, the determination of admission standards should be left to the schools, and not to the State, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 13. Rights of Schools.</b> - In addition to their rights provided for by law, school shall enjoy the following:<br><br>1. The right of their governing boards or lawful authorities to provide for the proper governance of the school and to adopt and enforce administrative or management systems.<br><br>2. The right for institutions of higher learning to determine on academic grounds <b>who shall be admitted to study</b>, who may teach, and what shall be the subjects of the study and research. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Of course, this is not to relegate the State to being an impotent commander or a mere passive guardian. The State may set minimum admission requirements, provided that these are reasonable and equitable in their application, both for the school and the applicant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Said standards must never transgress upon Constitutional rights.<br><br>Judged against these parameters, it becomes all too apparent that LEBMO No. 7, insofar as it imposes the PhilSAT, is a constricting regulation that binds the hands of the schools from choosing who to admit in their law program. The LEB thrusts upon the law schools a pre-selected roster of applicants, and effectively deprives them of the right to select their own students on the basis of factors and criteria of their own choosing. Consequently, the law schools are left with no choice but to elect from this limited pool. Worse, they are forbidden from admitting those who failed to comply with the LEB's requirements, under pain of administrative sanctions.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the imposition of the PhilSAT is an oppressive and arbitrary measure. The LEB is bereft of power to substitute its own judgment for that of the universities. Rather, the universities should be free to consider other criteria (aside from the PhilSAT) in determining their prospective students' aptitude and ability to survive in law school. In fact, during the Oral Arguments held on March 5, 2019, amicus curiae Dean Sedfrey Candelaria revealed that passing the law entrance exam is not a guarantee that the student will survive through law school:<br><blockquote><b>JUSTICE A. REYES:</b><br>All right. But then you would always state that it is not a guarantee that a student will pass law school because he passed the law entrance exam?<br><br><b>DEAN CANDELARIA:</b><br>I agree, Your Honor, in fact in my conversations with Father Bernas who has a longer stay with me in the law school, I think he has even said that any students catch up, let [sic] say, people who may have studied in other regions, they easily catch up once they go to Manila, at least in the Ateneo when he was Dean and I've observed this also during my tenure that there are people who have caught up with the rest come second year. . ."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>Concededly, although the PhilSAT measures a person's aptitude or ability to cope with the rigors of law school, this is but a one-sided assessment. It fails to consider the person's diligence, drive or zeal - which are equally important in successfully obtaining a degree in law. Surely, one who may not be as proficient in language or reasoning, but is filled with a passion and a desire to learn, may perform as well as another who is innately intelligent, but who is apathetic and indifferent. There are certainly other extraneous factors, traits or characteristics that make a good student, which the law school must be allowed to consider, should it so desire.<br><br><b><i>The PhilSAT is Violative of the Students' Academic Freedom and Right to Acquire Knowledge</i></b><br><br>Article XIV, Section 5(3) of the 1987 Constitution declares that "[e]very citizen has a right to select a profession or course of study, subject to fair, reasonable, and equitable admission and academic requirements."<br><br>Certainly, the right to pursue a course of higher learning is supported, no less by the State. It must endeavor to ensure a becoming respect for every citizen's right to select his/her course of study.

Although these rights are not absolute, they may only be curbed by standards that are "fair, reasonable, and equitable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Although the Constitution fails to specifically mention that academic freedom is equally enjoyed by students, this lacuna was supplied by the Court in <b><i>Ateneo de Manila University v.

Albeit a radical sense of freedom, in our jurisdiction, this so-called thirst may be curbed by reasonable standards.<br><br>Remarkably, the framers of the 1987 Constitution supported the idea of academic freedom as a "spirit of free inquiry,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which includes the pursuit of truth and advocacy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Moreover, they believed that academic freedom is essential to create an environment that will "encourage creative and critical thinking."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In turn, this free flow of ideas will promote the full and wholistic development of the students. Also, more than the promotion of the students' welfare, the framers even went further by saying that this freedom of thought may even lead to the country's improvement - "so far as this [academic freedom is allowed full play in the academic institutions or in the institutions of higher learning, I think we will end up the better as people."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the framers stressed the need to protect this cherished freedom. They emphasized that the right to learn and discover, "should be protected as long as the activities fall within the canons of scholarship, and subjected as it were to the forces of the market place of ideas."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> They believed that if the State encourages critical and creative thinking, it will naturally protect it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In addition, the law affirms the right of students to select their own course of study. This is evident from Section 9(2) of B.P. Blg. 232, otherwise known as the Education Act of 1982, as amended:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 9. Rights of Students in School.</b> - In addition to other rights, and subject to the limitations prescribed by law and regulations, students and pupils in all schools shall enjoy the following rights:<br><br>1. The right to receive, primarily through competent instruction, relevant qualify education in line with national goals and conducive to their full development as person with human dignity.<br><br>2. <b>The right to freely choose their field of study subject to existing curricula and to continue their course therein up to graduation, except in cases of academic deficiency, or violation of disciplinary regulations.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>More so, as adverted to by the <i>ponencia</i>, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that "[e]veryone has a right to education. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Significantly, the Constitution, the law, and international conventions. are one in affirming the students' right to apply to a school of their own, choosing, and correspondingly, select their own course of study. Although said right of the students is subject to their compliance with the criteria dictated by the school, it must be stressed however that the student and the school are free to negotiate between themselves, without the interference of the State. This scenario should be likened to a free marketplace where the school showcases its product- its curricula, professors, environment, while a student, in turn, flaunts his/her own capabilities, skills, and talents. The parties should be left to freely decide for themselves whether they are a fit for each other. The State should not meddle, unless absolutely necessary for the public's safety and welfare. Should it decide to intervene, its power is in no way almighty, but must be circumscribed within the bounds of reasonableness.<br><br><b><i>The Right to Study law is an Adjunct of One's Fundamental Right to Acquire Knowledge. In the Same Vein, the Manner Through Which the Law School Decides to Teach the Law is an Exercise of its Freedom of Expression</i></b><br><br>This concept was broached during the deliberations for the 1973 Constitution. Delegate Vicente G. Sinco intimated that the freedom of the teacher and of the student may be anchored on the basic Constitutional guarantees of freedom, in addition to the specific guarantee of academic freedom:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote>by expressly guaranteeing academic freedom the new provision implicitly distinguishes academic freedom from a citizen's political right of free expression. Litigation on this new freedom, therefore will force the courts to search for standards of adjudication, standards not necessarily identical with those that have already been established for the general freedom of expression. <b>Academic freedom is freedom not just in the context of a political freedom but also in the context of a narrower academic community.</b> The implication of this distinction must be explored. The search for standards for academic freedom must take into consideration not just the general theory of freedom of expression but also the functions of a university.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote>More so, beyond the Philippine laws and Constitution, the right to knowledge is a universal human right, protected no less by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ("ICPR").<br><br>Specifically, Article 19 of the ICPR, affirms that:<br><blockquote>Article 19<br><br>1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.<br><br><b>2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.</b><br><br>3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:<br><blockquote>(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;<br>(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Indeed, freedom of expression, which includes the right to receive information and ideas of all kinds, is a civil and political right. It is an inalienable right that stems from a person's inherent dignity. It is likewise the foundation of freedom, justice and peace. in the world.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As such, this essential guarantee may only be restricted insofar as it violates the rights and reputation of others, or if absolutely necessary to protect national security and public order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Moreover, knowledge cannot be passed without a medium. Thus, the right of the law school to teach, the information it shares, and its manner of teaching are representations of its freedom of expression. The State should only step in, should it find that "the means or methods of instruction are clearly found to be inefficient, impractical, or riddled with corruption."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, I wish to underscore that a distinction exists between the right to study law and the privilege to practice it. Although these two activities may be related, they are not one and the same. The study of law does not <i>ipso facto</i> lead to the practice thereof. This was a point that I stressed during the Oral Arguments on March 5, 2019:<br><blockquote>"<b>JUSTICE A. REYES:</b> But you are not in the pursuit of the study of law not in the pursuit of being a lawyer. Is there a need for an entrance exam if he just wants to study the law itself as a person?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>He doesn't want to become a lawyer, he just wants to be a student of the law. He has a lot of time on his hands, he has all the money. He just wants to study law, is there anything wrong with that?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote>Lest it be forgotten, the law is not only a profession, but it is first and foremost, a field of study. It is an interesting and practical science, that proves useful for everyday life, and for one's personal growth and career. For instance, the Law on Obligations and Contracts is practical for one engaged in business; Constitutional Law piques the interest of one desirous to learn about the workings of the government and the citizen's fundamental rights; and Criminal Law, inflames one curious about society's penal laws and systems. For others, obtaining a Bachelor's Degree or a Juris Doctor in Law serves as a gateway to promotion. These are but a few examples of a myriad of realities pertaining to the law's importance as an academic field.<br><br>Certainly, the State has no legitimate interest in preventing such individuals who want to learn about the law, who have free time on their hands, and who possess resources to fund a legal education. Neither does it have the right to prevent a law school that is willing and capable of teaching such persons from admitting them in their program.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>This concern was likewise echoed by the eminent magistrate, Justice Antonio T. Carpio, when he said:<br><blockquote>Preventing anyone from going to law school who can afford to go to school pay for his own tuition fees, that's unreasonable. Even if he scores only one percent (1%), if the school is willing to accept him, he is willing to pay, you cannot stop him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote>Also, as eloquently articulated by Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen,<br><blockquote>Considering, Chair, that this affects a freedom and a primordial freedom at that, freedom of expression, academic freedom, the way we teach our, as Justice Andy Reyes pointed out, the way we teach law to our citizens and therefore, to me, the level of scrutiny should not be cursory. The level of scrutiny must be deep and I would think it would apply strict scrutiny in this regard. Therefore, if there was no study that supported it, then perhaps, it may be stricken down as unreasonable, and therefore, grave abuse of discretion. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote>It is therefore apparent that an individual's right to knowledge and the manner by which such knowledge is pursued, are entitled to a high degree of protection by the State and its agencies. Our State is in no way autocratic. It is not repressive, and should not prevent its citizens from gaining knowledge that will promote their personal growth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> These are simple realities that cannot be ignored. To deprive a person of his right to knowledge, which is an adjunct of one's freedom of expression, may not be done under flimsy and vague pretexts. This Constitutional protection to freedom of expression enjoys an exalted place in the spectrum of rights, and is certainly entitled to the highest level of scrutiny.<br><br><b><i>A Legitimate Objective Will not in Itself Justify State Intrusion if the Means Employed Pursuant Thereto are Unreasonable and Oppressive</i></b><br><br>There is no doubt that the ultimate goal of attaining quality legal education is a legitimate and lofty objective. For sure, no country would negligently allow degenerate institutions that fail to properly educate students to persist to the detriment of the community. However, the issue is not as simple. It must be noted that the test for a valid exercise of police power is two-pronged. The presence of a legitimate State objective must be balanced alongside a reasonable means for achieving such goal: One cannot exist without the other.<br><br>Remarkably, in <i>Lupangco v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the Court struck down the regulation issued by the Professional Regulatory' Commission which prohibited those taking the accountancy licensure examinations from attending review classes, conferences and receiving hand-outs, review materials, or tips three days immediately preceeding the examination day. The Court stressed that although the measure was backed by a noble objective, this will not serve as a justification to violate constitutional freedoms, to wit:<br><blockquote>Of course, We realize that the questioned resolution was adopted for a commendable purpose which is "to preserve the integrity and purity of the licensure examinations." However, its good aim cannot be a cloak to conceal its constitutional infirmities. On its face, it can be readily seen that it is unreasonable in that an examinee cannot even <i>attend any review class, briefing, conference or the like, or receive any hand-out, review material, or any tip from any school, college or university, or any review center or the like or any reviewer, lecturer, instructor, official or employee of any of the aforementioned or similar institutions</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>Indeed, the level of supervision and regulation granted unto the State must be reasonable. This "reasonableness" in no way grants a warrant for the State to exercise oppressive control over the schools. In the case of the PhilSAT, in addition to being arbitrary and oppressive, the LEB likewise failed to establish that the means employed will serve its purpose of improving the quality of legal education.<br><br>In fact, during the oral arguments, Chairperson Aquende admitted that the LEB issuances imposing the PhilSAT were bereft of statistical basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This presents an even greater challenge against the PhilSAT. It appears that the LEB merely operates on the hunch that the PhilSAT will improve the quality of legal education. Although I agree with the point made by Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa that the schools (or the LEB) are not required to conduct statistical research regarding the effectiveness of the PhilSAT. This is only to underscore the absence of any factual basis proving the LEB's contention.<br><br>Worse, the PhilSAT renders nugatory the Constitutional provision mandating that education should be made accessible to all by limiting a legal degree to an elite few. Students who desire to obtain a degree in law are immediately barred from this pursuit, simply on their purported inanity, as determined by the PhilSAT. In effect, the State punishes the students instead of encouraging them to learn, thereby making the law a restrictive subject that is only available to an exclusive few who possess the required aptitude and wealth.<br><br>All told, this case is riddled with paradoxes. The LEB, in its desire to achieve quality legal education, bullheadedly pursued such end and trampled upon the right to accessible education. It must be stressed that quality education may not be accomplished by excluding a segment of the population from learning. Access to education should never be sacrificed to achieve this end. Rather, these two goals should go hand-in-hand. Barring the citizens from pursuing further studies and learning more about the law, lead to stripping them of their fundamental right to knowledge. There is nothing more stifling to our democracy than repressing our own citizens' pursuit for personal growth. For sure, there are other Constitutionally permissible ways of achieving this end.<br><br>As a final note, the law is personified by Lady Justice, whose eyes are covered with a blindfold as an assurance that she will always dispense justice objectively to her suitors, regardless of their wealth and power; her scales of justice are perfectly balanced, for she delicately weighs all circumstances before her; her sword is scathing, proving that her justice is swift and firm - this is the symbol of law and justice. Ironically, however, with the PhilSAT, entry to the study of law (a field that will train one to imbibe justice and fairness) is far from objective arid just. In this oppressive scenario, Lady Justice's eyes are opened wide as she peremptorily judges prospective students, barring the inane from learning the law; her scales are tilted in favor of an elite few; and her sword is sharp and piercing against those who failed to reach her criteria. This is not the law, and it should never be. <b>Thus, I vote to declare as unconstitutional LEBMO No. 7, and all its adjunct orders.</b><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Petition, p. 1148.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Main Decision, p. 15.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Deliberations for the I 987 Constitution, Volume IV, p. 170; Bernas, p. 91. <br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 1987 CONSTITUTION, Article II, Sec. 17.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 1987 CONSTITUTION, Article XIV, Sec. 2(3).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 1987 CONSTITUTION, Article XIV, Sec. 2(1).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> REPUBLIC ACT No. 7662 - An Act Providing for Reforms in the Legal Education, Creating for the Purpose, A Legal Education Board and For Other Purposes.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> LEBMO No. 7.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> LEBMO No. 7; LEBMO No. 2-2013, Section 32.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 1987 CONSTITUTION, Article XIV, Section 4(1).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 1987 CONSTITUTION, Article XIV, Section 5(2).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>The PTA of St. Mathew Christian Academy, et al. v.

No. 230642, it seeks to nullify Republic Act No. 7662 and abolish the Legal Education Board (<i>LEB</i>); and in G.R. No. 242954, to annul and set aside LEB Memorandum Order Nos. 7-2016 and 11-2017, dated December 29, 2016 and April 20, 2017, respectively, and LEB Memorandum Circular No. 18-2018, dated October 5, 2018.<br><br>I vote to partly grant the consolidated petitions.<br><br>There is a stereotype that the study of law is a precursor for the practice of law. However, the study of law is not that simple. There may be instances when a person studies law for its philosophy, wisdom, and concepts; and choose not to take the bar examinations as he or she is not interested in becoming a lawyer. Thus, the study of law does not always result into the practice of law. Nonetheless, even after hurdling the bar, lawyers and judges are still mandated to continue the study of law. It is a well-settled rule that the study of law is a never-ending and ceaseless process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The study of the law is not an exact science with definite fields of black and white and unbending rules and rigid dogmas. The beauty of this discipline in the words of Justice Holmes, is the "penumbra shading gradually from one extreme to another," that gives rise to those honest differences of opinion among the brotherhood as to its correct interpretation. Honest differences are allowed and, indeed, inevitable, but we certainly must frown on stilted readings to suit one's motives, especially if they are less than noble. The law does not permit this, and much less, for that matter, does equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><i>Academic Freedom of Institutions of Higher Learning</i><br><br>It is clear that the study of law is within the domain of academic freedom. In <i>Ateneo de Manila University v. Judge Capulong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Court stated that the term "academic freedom", which has evolved to describe the emerging rights related to intellectual liberty, has traditionally been associated with freedom of thought, speech, expression and the press; in other words, it has been identified with the right of individuals in universities, such as professors, researchers and administrators, to investigate, pursue, discuss and, in the immortal words of Socrates, "to follow the argument wherever it may lead," free from internal and external interference or pressure. Obviously, its optimum impact is best realized where this freedom is exercised judiciously and does not degenerate into unbridled license. Early cases on this individual aspect of academic freedom have stressed the need for assuring to such individuals a measure of independence through the guarantees of autonomy and security of tenure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Academic freedom has long been recognized by our organic laws. Section 5, Article XIV, of the 1935 Constitution states that universities established by the State shall enjoy academic freedom. Likewise, Section 8, Article XV, of the 1973 Constitution states that all institutions of higher learning shall enjoy academic freedom. Under the present Constitution, Section 5, Article XIV, states that academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning. Verily, institutions of higher learning, such as schools, colleges, and universities offering a degree program in law, all have constitutionally enshrined academic freedom.<br><br>Academic freedom of institutions of higher learning have the following essential freedoms: (1) who may teach; (2) what may be taught; (3) how it shall be taught; and (4) who may be admitted to study.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This was first discussed in the Supreme Court of the United States (<i>SCOTUS</i>) case of <i>Sweezy v. New Hampshire</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In that case, Paul Sweezy, who was an economist and lecturer in the University of New Hampshire, was subpoenaed by the State Attorney General to answer several questions, which included inquiries regarding his lectures on Socialism at the university. Paul Sweezy refused to answer particular questions and was declared in contempt of court. The SCOTUS reversed the contempt charge on the basis of violation of academic freedom and stated that:<br><blockquote>The essentiality of freedom in the community of American universities is almost self-evident. No one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth. To impose any straitjacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation. No field of education is so thoroughly comprehended by man that new discoveries cannot yet be made. Particularly is that true in the social sciences, where few, if any, principles are accepted as absolutes. Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain new maturity and understanding; otherwise, our civilization will stagnate and die.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>In the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter, he explained the importance of academic freedom in a university, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>"In a university knowledge is its own end, not merely a means to an end. A university ceases to be true to its own nature if it becomes the tool of Church or State or any sectional interest. A university is characterized by the spirit of free inquiry, its ideal being the ideal of Socrates-'to follow the argument where it leads.' This implies the right to examine, question, modify or reject traditional ideas and beliefs. Dogma and hypothesis are incompatible, and the concept of an immutable doctrine is repugnant to the spirit of a university. The concern of its scholars is not merely to add and revise facts in relation to an accepted framework, but to be ever examining and modifying the framework itself.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>"Freedom to reason and freedom for disputation on the basis of observation and experiment are the necessary conditions for the advancement of scientific knowledge. A sense of freedom is also necessary for creative work in the arts which, equally with scientific research, is the concern of the university.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>". . . It is the business of a university to provide that atmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, experiment and creation. It is an atmosphere in which there prevail 'the four essential freedoms' of a university-<b>to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In the subsequent case of <i>Keyishian v. Board of Regents</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the SCOTUS held that a law cannot force teachers to sign an oath stating they are not members of certain communist parties pursuant to their academic freedom and because the law is overbreadth, to wit:<br><blockquote>Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendent value to all of us, and not merely to the teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom. "The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools." The classroom is peculiarly the "marketplace of ideas." The Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth "out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection."</blockquote>On the other hand, in <i>University of California Regents v. Bakke</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the SCOTUS tackled the legality of the university policy which requires a particular number of minorities for admission. It grounded its analysis on academic freedom and stated that "the university's use of race in its admission may use for the attainment of a diverse student body. Nothing less than the nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this United States. <b>In seeking the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the 'robust exchange of ideas,' a university seeks to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.</b> Both tradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Nevertheless, while race may be considered as one of the several factors for admission, the SCOTUS ruled that the specific or fixed number of minorities for university admission is too unreasonable. The ruling in <i>University of California Regents v. Bakke</i> was affirmed in <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> regarding admission in the University of Michigan Law School, <i>Gratz v. Bollinger</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> regarding the point system admission policy of the University of Michigan, and <i>Fisher v. University of Texas</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><i>Academic Freedom in Philippine Jurisdiction</i><br><br>The four essential freedoms constituting academic freedom have also been discussed by our jurisprudence. In <i>University of the Phils. v. Civil Service Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court discussed institutions of higher learning's freedom to determine "who may teach." In that case, a professor was on leave of absence without pay for four (4) years. Nevertheless, the university therein still accepted the professor back to work even though the Civil Service Commission had terminated his services. The Court ruled that the university has the academic freedom to determine who shall teach. This freedom encompasses the autonomy to choose who should teach and, concomitant therewith, who should be retained in its rolls of professors and other academic personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It was also stated therein that "since academic freedom is a dynamic concept, we want to expand the frontiers of freedom, especially in education, therefore, we shall leave it to the courts to develop further the parameters of academic freedom."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence has also recognized that institutions of higher learning have the enshrined freedom to determine "who may be admitted to study." In <i>Garcia v. The Faculty Admission Committee, Loyola School of Theology</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> it involved a student who wanted to compel the Loyola School of Theology to accept her in their Master of Arts in Theology program. The respondent therein invoked its academic freedom to admit students in its program. The Court denied the petition and held that the respondent indeed had the academic freedom to determine who would be admitted to their school. It was highlighted that colleges and universities should not be looked upon as public utilities devoid of any discretion as to whom to admit or reject Education, especially higher education, belongs to a different, and certainly higher category.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In <i>Ateneo de Manila University v. Judge Capulong</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the law students involved in the hazing incident argued that the school imposed arbitrary rules and penalties regarding its admission policy. The Court held that the law school, which is an institute of higher learning, had the academic freedom to determine who may be admitted, including the power to promulgate rules concerning student discipline. The establishment of rules governing university-student relations, particularly those pertaining to student discipline, may be regarded as vital, not merely to the smooth and efficient operation of the institution, but to its very survival.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In <i>Licup v. University of San Carlos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the students involved committed demonstrations in the university that were far from peaceful and the school administration imposed the penalty of non-admission. The Court affirmed the penalty imposed by the school. While it is true that students are entitled to the right to pursue their education, the school is likewise entitled to academic freedom and has the concomitant right to see to it that this freedom is not jeopardized. The Court underscored that an institution of learning has a contractual obligation to afford its students a fair opportunity to complete the course they seek to pursue. However, when a student commits a serious breach of discipline or fails to maintain the required academic standard, he forfeits that contractual right; and the Court should not review the discretion of university authorities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>However, academic freedom of institutions of higher learning is not absolute; rather, it is subject to the limitation of reasonability and that it should not be arbitrarily exercised. In <i>Isabelo, Jr. v. Perpetual Help College of Rizal, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the student therein, who questioned the tuition fee hike of the school, was expelled because he allegedly had Citizen's Military Training (<i>CMT</i>) deficiencies. The Court held that the school cannot invoke academic freedom to immediately expel its student based on mere deficiencies in the CMT. The Court held that "[w]hile we ordinarily would not delve into the exercise of sound judgment, we will not, however, hesitate to act when we perceive taints of arbitrariness in the process. The punishment of expulsion appears to us rather disproportionate to his having had some unit deficiencies in his CMT course. Indeed, the DECS itself is conceding to the grant of the instant petition. The circumstances lend truth to the petitioner's claim that the private respondent has strongly been influenced by his active participation in questioning PHCR's application for tuition fee increase."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in <i>Morales v. The Board of Regents of the University of the Phils.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court emphasized that the discretion of schools of learning to formulate rules and guidelines in the granting of honors for purposes of graduation forms part of academic freedom. And such discretion may not be disturbed much less controlled by the courts, unless there is grave abuse of discretion in its exercise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that institutions of higher learning are granted academic freedom by the Constitution, which includes that freedom to determine who may be admitted to study. The academic freedom of these institutions, however, are not unbridled and subject to the test of reasonableness.<br><br><i>LEB Memorandum Orders and Circular unreasonably restrict academic freedom</i> <br><br>LEB Memorandum Order No. 7-2016 instituted the PhilSAT, which is an aptitude test that measures the academic potential of an examinee. Only those who pass with a 55% score on the examination shall be allowed admission in law schools. LEB Memorandum Order No, 11-2017, states that those who failed the first PhilSAT may be conditionally admitted to law schools in the first semester of school year 2017 to 2018 provided they take the next scheduled PhilSAT. On the other hand, LEB Memorandum Circular No. 18-2018 discontinued the conditional admission of students. Thus, the LEB requires the mandatory taking of the PhilSAT before being admitted to any law school; and, a student shall not be admitted if he or she fails the said examination. In other words, PhilSAT is exclusionary and those that do not pass the said test shall not be admitted in the study of law. The respondents argue that LEB's institution of the PhilSAT is within the State's power to regulate all educational institutions.<br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> that the LEB Memorandum Orders and Circular, requiring the PhilSAT as mandatory and exclusionary, are unconstitutional.<br><br>Institutes of higher learning have academic freedom, under the Constitution, and this includes the freedom to determine who may be admitted to study. Such freedom may only be limited by the State based on the test of reasonability. In this case, however, the assailed LEB Memorandum Orders fail to provide a reasonable justification for restraining the admission of students to law schools based on the following reasons:<br><br><i>First</i>, by making the PhilSAT mandatory and exclusionary, the LEB significantly restricts the freedom of law schools to determine who shall be admitted as law students. Only those who pass the said examination shall be considered for admission to these institutions of higher learning. Consequently, the LEB, through the PhilSAT, first chooses the potential law students, and only afterwards, shall the law schools be allowed to choose their students from the limited pool of student-passers. The said institutes of higher learning are barred from considering those students who failed the examinations, regardless of their previous academic grades and achievements.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the LEB does not give any justification for the required passing score of 55% and the format of the examinations. The studies cited by the LEB were conducted by different organizations, for different professions, and for foreign jurisdictions. Indeed, no concrete study conducted in the Philippines for the legal profession was provided to substantiate the passing score and the test format. It is not even clear whether the consensus of the law schools in the country was secured before the LEB imposed the PhilSAT. Without any concrete basis for the conduct of the examination, it would be unreasonable to impose the same mandatorily and without exemption to the institutes of higher learning.<br><br><i>Third</i>, law schools are given no option other than to follow the LEB Memorandum Orders and Circular. Failure to comply with these shall result in administrative sanctions, ranging from closure of the law school, phase-out of the law program, provision cancellation of its recognition and/or liability to pay a fine of P10,000.00 for each infraction. Even without a valid reason, for the imposition of the PhilSAT requirement, the LEB completely restricts the law schools from accepting students who did not pass the said examination. The schools' exercise of academic freedom to choose their students is restricted by the threat of administrative and pecuniary sanctions.<br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the LEB Memorandum Orders and Circular were issued under the exercise of police power of the State to regulate the rights of certain institutions, it does not justify the unreasonable restriction on the academic freedom of institutes of higher learning. Notwithstanding its extensive sweep, police power is not without its own limitations. For all its awesome consequences, it may not be exercised arbitrarily or unreasonably. Otherwise, and in that event, it defeats the purpose for which it is exercised, that is, to advance the public good. Thus, when the power is used to further private interests at the expense of the citizenry, there is a clear misuse of the power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Here, the LEB failed to establish the reasonable means to limit the academic freedom of the institutes of higher learning. Again, there is no valid explanation provided on the mandatory and exclusionary requirement of the PhilSAT, its passing grade, and format of examinations. Manifestly, to impose a penalty on law schools based on an unreasonable policy that restricts academic freedom would be an invalid exercise of police power.<br><br><i>PhilSAT is different from the NMAT and LSAT</i><br><br>One of the arguments of the LEB is that the PhilSAT is comparable to the National Medical Admission Test (NMAT), which was upheld by the Court in <i>Tablarin v. Judge Gutierrez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and the Law School Admission Test (<i>LSAT</i>) in the United States.<br><br>I disagree.<br><br>There are too many differences between the PhilSAT and the NMAT that they cannot be treated in the same vein. One of the most notable differences is that in the NMAT, there is actually no passing or failing grade; rather, the examinees are merely given a percentile score. Medical schools have the discretion to determine the acceptable percentile score of their potential students. Thus, even with the NMAT, medical schools have full freedom and control of students they intend to admit. They have the sole discretion to impose the required percentile score in the NMAT, whether high or low, as a requirement for admission. In fact, some medical schools are even allowed to conditionally accept students who have not yet taken their NMAT.<br><br>Unlike the NMAT, the PhilSAT provides for a strict passing score of 55%. This passing score was provided by the LEB and not decided by the law schools themselves. These law schools have no option in adjusting the passing score and they can only accept students who pass the said test. Stated differently, law schools have no discretion to determine which students they will admit insofar as the PhilSAT requirement is concerned.<br><br>On the other hand, the LSAT is a nationwide admission. test for law · schools in the United States. The said test is administered by the Law School Admission Council (<i>LSAC</i>), which is a non-profit corporation comprised of more than 200 law schools in the United States and Canada. The institutes of higher learning themselves participate, prepare, and conduct the LSAT, and not their government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Nonetheless, even if there is the LSAT in the United States, the said examination is not an absolute requirement for law school admission. The American Bar Association Standards and Rules of Procedure merely require each student-applicant to take a valid and reliable admission test and it is not only confined to the LSAT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, law schools in the United States are allowed to require other admission tests provided that these are valid and reliable. Indeed, the LSAT requirement in the United States does not unreasonably restrict the academic freedom of the law schools therein.<br><br>With the PhilSAT, however, the examination is mandatory and exclusionary, and local law schools have no discretion to choose a different admission test. The law schools are only confined to choosing those students who pass the PhilSAT, which does not provide any valid justification for restricting academic freedom.<br><br>Evidently, both the NMAT and the LSAT are different from the PhilSAT. The former respect and consider the academic freedom of institutes of higher learning in their liberty of choosing their students; while with the latter, law schools are unreasonably constrained in determining the students it may accept for enrollment.<br><br><i>Uniform Admission Examination instituted by Foreign Law Schools</i><br><br><b>I firmly believe that PhilSAT should be set aside; instead, the law schools in the Philippines, through the Philippine Association of Law Schools (<i>PALS</i>), and under the mere supervision of LEB, should establish a unified, standardized, and acceptable law admission examination.</b> Said examination must be unrestrictive of academic freedom, cost-efficient, accessible, and an effective tool in assessing incoming law students. At the onset, I will discuss the constitutional viability of a unified law admission examination, spearheaded by the law schools, pursuant to their right to academic freedom.<br><br>There was a time when law schools could follow the advice of Wigmore, who believed that "the way to find out whether a boy [or girl] has the makings of a competent lawyer is to see what he [or she] can do in a first year of law studies."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In those days there were enough spaces to admit every applicant who met minimal credentials, and they all could be given the opportunity to prove themselves in law school. But by the 1920's many law schools found that they could not admit all minimally qualified applicants, and a selection process began. The pressure to use some kind of admissions test mounted, and a number of schools instituted them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the United States, the LSAT was formulated by the LSAC. The idea of LSAT began on May 17, 1945, when Frank Bowles, Admission Director at Columbia Law School, wrote to the President of College Entrance Examination Board (<i>CEEB</i>) suggesting the creation of a law capacity test to be used in admission decisions. It was discussed that the validity of the LSAT would be linked to its correlation with grades in the first year of law study. Consequently, correlation with success in taking the bar examination was rejected because candidates often take the bar exam several times and everybody passes them sooner or later.

That applicant would be offered admission not because he is black, but because as an individual he has shown he has the potential, while the Harvard man may have taken less advantage of the vastly superior opportunities offered him. Because of the weight of the prior handicaps, that black applicant may not realize his full potential in the first year of law school, or even in the full three years, but in the long pull of a legal career his achievements may far outstrip those of his classmates whose earlier records appeared superior by conventional criteria. There is currently no test available to the Admissions Committee that can predict such possibilities with assurance, but the Committee may nevertheless seek to gauge it as best it can, and weigh this factor in its decisions. <b>Such a policy would not be limited to blacks, or Chicanos or Filipinos, or American Indians, although undoubtedly groups such as these may in practice be the principal beneficiaries of it.</b> But a poor Appalachian white, or a second generation Chinese in San Francisco, or some other American whose lineage is so diverse as to defy ethnic labels, may demonstrate similar potential and thus be accorded favorable consideration by the Committee<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (emphases supplied)</blockquote>On the other hand, in the United Kingdom (<i>UK</i>), there is a National Admissions Test for Law (<i>LNAT</i>), which was adopted in 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It is the only aptitude test currently used in the UK for the selection of people to the legal profession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It was established by a consortium of Universities, comprised of the following: University of Bristol, Durham University, University of Nottingham and University of Oxford, King's College London, LSE London School of Economics and Political Science, and University College London.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The LNAT consists of a multiple choice test and a written essay and is designed to measure the following verbal reasoning skills: comprehension, interpretation, analysis, synthesis, induction, and deduction.

Before CLAT, each university running Bachelor of Laws courses conducted its own admission test. As a result, students aspiring for good legal education had to write a number of admission tests; and this multiplicity of admission tests caused tremendous hardship, both physically and financially, to candidates. In 2006, this issue was raised in a Writ Petition filed by Varun Bhagat against the Union of India and the various National Law Schools in the Supreme Court of India.

Instead, it must be initiated and organized by the law schools themselves, pursuant to their constitutionally enshrined academic freedom.<br><br>Currently, there is an organization of law schools in the country. The PALS, established in 1967, is a non-stock corporation composed of 112 law schools nationwide.

As discussed earlier, a unified admission test for law schools proves to be one of the effective mechanisms in determining who among the applicants are mostly likely to succeed in the first year of law study. And, more importantly, this unified admission examination is conducted and organized by the law schools' themselves through their academic freedom. Manifestly, this system of unified law admission examination, conducted by the law schools themselves, has been observed and successfully implemented in the United States, U.K. and India.<br><br>The flaws in the LEB Memoranda and Orders will not be followed if the law schools will organize this unified admission test. A standardized admission examination must not be the sole measure in determining whether an applicant wilt be accepted in law school. The answers a student can give in an admission examination is limited by the creativity and intelligence of the test-maker. A student with a better or more original understanding of the problem than the test-maker may realize that none of the alternative answers are any good, but there is no way for that student to demonstrate his or her understanding. If a student is strong-minded, nonconformist, unusual, original, or creative, that student must stifle his or her impulses and conform to the norms that the test-maker established. The more profoundly gifted the candidate is, the more his or her resentment will rise against the mental strait jacket into which the testers would force his or her mind.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Stated differently, the unified admission test should not be exclusionary.<br><br>Accordingly, the law admission test should not be the sole basis for admission in law schools. As discussed earlier, there are other relevant factors, such as undergraduate achievements, motivation, or cultural backgrounds that the admission test cannot measure. Besides the admission test, the law school must still be given discretion to determine on its own, based on its academic freedom, the decision of whom to admit as students. Thus, the proposed standardized admission test should only be one of many criteria for admission to any law school. It would be the decision of each law school whether to accept or deny admission of a potential law student under their academic freedom which would not be curtailed by the unified law entrance examination since it would only be one of several factors for admission.<br><br>At the end of the day, the decision of creating a standardized admission test for law schools rests upon the law schools in the country. These institutions of higher learning may come together, through the PALS, and initiate for the creation and implementation of a standardized admission test. It would be the culmination of the collective effort of law schools in their exercise of academic freedom.<br><br>In the event that the law schools pursue drafting, creating and organizing a standardized admission test for legal studies in the, Philippines, the LEB would not be entirely set aside in this endeavor. Under R.A. No. 7662, one of the powers of the LEB is to <u><b>supervise</b></u> the law schools in the country.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The power of supervision is defined as the power of a superior officer to see to it that lower officers perform their functions in accordance with law. This is distinguished from the power of control or the power of an officer to alter or modify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> An officer in control lays down the rules in the doing of an act. It they are not followed, he may, in his discretion, order the act undone or re-done by his subordinate or he may even decide to do it himself. Supervision does not cover such authority. The supervisor or superintendent merely sees to it that the rules are followed, but he himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, he may order the work done or re-done but only to conform to the prescribed rules. He may not prescribe his own manner for the doing of the act. He has no judgment on this matter except to see to it that the rules are followed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the LEB may only supervise the proposed standardized admission test of the law schools. <b>It cannot substitute its own judgment with respect to said test organized by the law schools; otherwise, it would violate the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning.</b> The LEB may only oversee whether the policies set forth by the law schools in the admission test are reasonable and just. It cannot, however, ultimately override the collective decisions of the law schools in the admission test for law students. In that manner, the LEB serves its purpose in the supervision of legal education and, at the same time, the academic freedom of law schools is respected.<br><br>Further, to ensure the success of the law admission test initiated by the law schools in the Philippines and supervised by the LEB, concrete studies on the effectiveness of this test must be conducted. There must be an effective monitoring system for the examination. It must be determined, before and after the admission test, whether said examination actually predicts and helps the success of law students, at the very least, in their first year of legal study. The admission examination should not be conducted for the sake of merely having one. It must have some tangible and definite benefit for the law schools and potential law students. To achieve this quality-control mechanism, the law schools, through PALS, and the LEB must thoroughly coordinate with each other to determine the most effective manner in conducting the admission examinations. It is only through constant cooperation and consultation with the stakeholders that the success of any admission examination will be guaranteed.<br><br>While the State has the power to regulate the education of its citizens, the 1987 Constitution expressly grants academic freedom in all institutions of higher learning, including law schools. Thus, the right to determine whom shall be admitted to law school should rest solely in these institutions. The State cannot absolutely control this important pillar of academic freedom of institutes of higher learning. I genuinely believe that it is only through the combined efforts of the law schools in the country that the envisioned unified admission test for law schools can achieve fruition based on the Constitution, the laws, and its practical implementation. Again, the LEB should only supervise the said unified admission examination conducted by the law schools.<br><br><i>Existing problems of the PhilSAT</i><br><br>If the law schools in the Philippines ultimately decide to conduct a unified and standardized law admission examination, as supervised by the LEB, then it must address the existing problems created by the PhilSAT. The problems were created precisely because the admission examination was solely conducted by the LEB, through its regulatory power. The law schools had no concrete voice in the formulation of the PhilSAT and their academic freedom is disrespected. Thus, it created several problems, particularly, financial burden and accessibility.<br><br>Under the PhilSAT, the LEB initially imposed a testing fee of P1,500.00 per examination, which was subsequently lowered to P1,000.00;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and there are only seven (7) testing centers across the entire country - Baguio City, Metro Manila, Legazpi City, Iloilo City, Cebu City, Davao City and Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Also, the LEB failed to explain why it had to impose said fee for a mere written examination. The sum collected by the LEB for the examination could amount to millions of pesos considering that there are thousands of students taking the PhilSAT. Glaringly, the LEB did not give any sufficient basis to justify the imposition of a P1,000.00 fee for an entrance examination.<br><br>Further, the LEB also failed to consider the transportation and logistical expenses that would be incurred by an examinee coming from the far-flung areas to take the examination in the limited seven (7) testing centers.

There should be no additional and unnecessary financial burden imposed on the examinees.<br><br>Likewise, the admission test should be accessible to all aspiring law students, especially those from the distant regions. The unified admission test should be conducted in numerous and strategic testing sites spread throughout the country. The law schools must avoid the situation where only those privileged students living in the capital cities will have access to the said unified examination. Moreover, considering that the examination shall now be conducted by the law schools in the Philippines, <b>then they may consider conducting the said test in their own school at a unified time and date with the rest of the law schools in the country to guarantee the examination's accessibility</b>.<br><br>It must be underscored that the study of law should not be hindered by financial and geographical hardships; rather, it must be reasonable and accessible to the examinees. Otherwise, it would defeat the purpose of a unified admission examination - to ensure that those intellectually capable to become law students, regardless of social status, shall be admitted to the study of law.<br><br><i>The Supreme Court and the study of law</i><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> states that the Court's rule-making power covers only the practice of law and cannot be unduly widened to cover the study of law. Nonetheless, it declares that the State, though statutes enacted by Congress and administrative regulations issued by the executive, consistently exercise police power over legal education. Hence, admissions, being an area of legal education, necessarily fall within the scope of the State's police power.<br><br>I dissent.<br><br>It is impossible to completely separate the interests of the Supreme Court and the law schools and the other branches of government with respect to legal education. There are several reasons that the study of law is affected, one way or another, by the Court's rule-making power.<br><br><i>First</i>, the Court has the exclusive power to promulgate rules for admission to the practice of law. Thus, the Court prescribe specific subjects that a law school must offer before its students can be admitted for the bar examinations. Section 5 of Rule 138 states:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 5. Additional requirements for other applicants.</b> - All applicants for admission other than those referred to in the two preceding sections shall, before being admitted to the examination, satisfactorily show that they have successfully completed all the prescribed courses for the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree, in a law school or university officially recognized by the Philippine Government or by the proper authority in the foreign jurisdiction where the degree has been granted.<br><br>No applicant who obtained the Bachelor of Laws degree in this jurisdiction shall be admitted to the bar examination unless he or she has satisfactorily completed the following course in a law school or university duly recognized by the government civil law, commercial law, remedial law, criminal law, public and private international law, political law, labor and social legislation, medical jurisprudence, taxation, legal ethics, and clinical legal education program.<br><br>A Filipino citizen who graduated from a foreign law school shall be admitted to the bar examination only upon submission to the Supreme Court of certifications showing: (a) completion of all courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree; (b) recognition or accreditation of the law school by the proper authority; and (c) completion of all fourth year subjects in the Bachelor of Laws academic program in a law school duly recognized by the Philippine Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote>Section 5 provides several requirements for the admission to the bar. Nevertheless, these requirements also affect the curriculum offered by law school. In effect, for a law school to successfully field bar examinees, it must offer all the prescribed courses for the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree. Thus, it cannot simply offer a two (2)-year short course on law.<br><br>More importantly, Section 5 provides for the specific courses that must be completed in a law school before a student may be allowed to take the bar examinations, to wit: civil law, commercial law, remedial law, criminal law, public and private international law, political law, labor and social legislation, medical jurisprudence, taxation, legal ethics, and clinical legal education program. Pursuant to this provision, a law school is mandated to offer these courses; otherwise, it will not be able to produce law graduates qualified to take the bar examinations. Stated simply, Section 5 provides for the minimum courses that a law school must offer to its law students. This is one of the direct provisions of the Rules of Court that the Court itself participate in the legal education of law students.<br><br><i>Second</i>, even before a student begins his study of law, the Supreme Court already provides the requirements for his or her pre-law studies. Section 6 of Rule 138 states:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 6. Pre-Law.</b> - No applicant for admission to the bar examination shall be admitted unless he presents a ce1iificate that he has satisfied the Secretary of Education that, before he began the study of law, he had pursued and satisfactorily completed in an authorized and recognized university or college, requiring for admission thereto the completion of a four-year high school course, the course of study prescribed therein for a bachelor's degree in arts or sciences with any of the following subjects as major or field of concentration: political science, logic, english, spanish, history and economics.</blockquote>The above-quoted provision provides that any potential law student must have a four-year high school course and a bachelor's degree in arts or sciences. If a law school admits students without these completed courses, then it will not be able to produce bar examinees. Verily, this rule affects the admission policy of the institutes of higher learning with respect to law students.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the precursor of Republic Act No. 7662, which is DECS Order No. 27, also recognizes that the Supreme Court contributes to the requirements for admission in law courses, to wit:<br><blockquote><center><b>Article VIII<br>Admission, Residence and Other Requirements</b></center><br><b>Section 1.</b> No applicant shall be enrolled in the law course unless he complies with specific requirements for admission by the Bureau of Higher Education and <b>the Supreme Court of the Philippines</b>, for which purpose he must present to the registrar the necessary credentials before the end of the enrolment period.</blockquote><i>Lastly</i>, even after earning a law degree, the Supreme Court continues to participate in the study of law. Bar Matter No. 850, which was adopted by the Court on August 22, 2000, provides for the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education requirement for members of the Bar. Continuing legal education is required of members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (<i>IBP</i>) to ensure that throughout their career, they keep abreast with law and jurisprudence, maintain the ethics of the profession and enhance the standards of the practice of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the Philippine Judicial Academy (<i>PHILJA</i>), initially created by the Supreme Court on March 12, 1996 through the issuance of Administrative Order No. 35-96, is a separate but component unit of the Supreme Court. It is an all-important factor in the promotion of judicial education in the Philippines. It receives full patronage and support from the Court which guarantees the participation of judges and court personnel in its programs and activities. PHILJA was institutionalized as a training school for justices, judges, court personnel, lawyers, and aspirants to judicial posts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></masscases.com></https:></https:></http:></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br><http: www.="" ust.edu.ph="" civil-law=""><https: arellanolaw.edu="" alpr="" v4n1c.pdf=""><https: supreme.justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 22="" 1=""><masscases.com cases="" sjc="" 61="" 61mass53.html=""></masscases.com></https:></https:></http:></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: www.="" ust.edu.ph="" civil-law=""><https: arellanolaw.edu="" alpr="" v4n1c.pdf=""><https: supreme.justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 22="" 1=""><masscases.com cases="" sjc="" 61="" 61mass53.html=""><i>Coordination and cooperation with the various stakeholders in legal education</i><br><br>The Supreme Court, either directly or indirectly, affects the legal education administered by the law schools as institutes of higher learning. The Court's authority over legal education is primarily observed in the bar examinations. Nevertheless, such authority or influence of the Court over legal education should be viewed in a coordinated and cooperative manner; and not as a limitation or restriction.<br><br>For more an a century, the bar examinations conducted by the Court have been the centerpiece of every law student's plight. The preparation, success and defeat of bar examinees are annual recurrences. The low passing percentage of the bar examinations proves it as one of the most difficult tests in the country. There are on-going initiatives to remedy this predicament and improve the legal education.<br><br>However, it must be stressed that the bar examination is not the sole and penultimate goal of the study of law. There is no clear evidence that grades and other evaluators of law school performance, and even the bar examination, are particularly good predictors of competence or success as a lawyer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The legal education is a wide spectrum of discipline, ranging from the traditional subjects of political, civil, and remedial laws, to the liberal and. innovative subjects of media, sports, and competition laws. It is not confined to litigation practice, court hearings, and drafting pleadings and other legal documents. The study of law is a dynamic concept that seeks to analyze, comprehend and apply the effects and interrelationships of the Constitution, laws, rules, and regulations, in view of a just and humane society.<br><br>Thus, instead of restricting the study of law only to the bar examinations, the Court must endeavor to promote its liberalization. The bar-­centric mindset of law schools must be amended. It must be emphasized that legal education should not confine law students to the syllabi for bar examinations. Instead, law schools must encourage their students to freely take elective subjects that spark their interests; participate in legal aid clinics to render free legal service; experience debate and moot court competitions; and publish law journal articles for their respective schools. These liberalizations of legal education must be accomplished for the enrichment of the law student's knowledge. In order to implement these innovative measures, various stakeholders in the entire country must be consulted and conferred with to ensure active, wide, and effective participation.<br><br>Notably, the Court has recently issued A.M. No. 19-03-24-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> otherwise known as the Revised Law Student Practice Rule, which liberalizes the Law Student Practice. It was issued to ensure access to justice for the marginalized sectors, to enhance learning opportunities of law students, to instill among them the value of legal professional social responsibility, and to prepare them for the practice of law. Further, the completion of clinical legal education courses was made a prerequisite of the bar examinations to produce practice-ready lawyers. Thus, the Court recognizes that, aside from the written bar examination, the practical aspect of legal education is an essential component in the formation of competent and able lawyers.<br><br>Again, while the Supreme Court has some authority over the legal education, this should be channeled in cooperation and coordination with different law schools of the country and even with the legislative and executive branch of the government, through the LEB. At best, the Court should only provide the minimum course requirements for the purpose of the bar examinations and should not be considered as a hindrance the study of law. Beyond that, law schools are directed to promote the innovative measures in legal education in furtherance of their academic freedom. Through a comprehensive and novel approach, the goal of improving the legal education is definitely within reach.<br><br><i>Constitutionality of R.A. No. 7662</i><br><br>One of the issues raised by the parties is that R.A. No. 7662 is unconstitutional because it infringes on the power of the Court to supervise the bar examination and legal education.<br><br>With respect to that issue, the Court must emphasize the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. The doctrine states that this Court may choose to ignore or side-step a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which the case can be disposed of.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> To remain true to its democratic moorings, judicial involvement must remain guided by a framework or deference and constitutional avoidance. This same principle underlies the basic doctrine that courts are to refrain from issuing advisory opinions. Specifically as regards this Court, only constitutional issues that are narrowly framed, sufficient to resolve an actual case, may be entertained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In other words, if the determination of the constitutionality of a particular statute can be avoided based on some other ground, then the Court will not touch upon the issue of unconstitutionality.<br><br>Here, the powers of the LEB enumerated under Section 7 of R.A. No. 7662 are assailed because they contradict the judicial power of the Court. Section 5, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 5.</b> The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(5) Promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, <b>the admission to the practice of law, the integrated bar, and legal assistance to the under-privileged</b>. Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. Rules of procedure of special courts and quasi-judicial bodies shall remain effective unless disapproved by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>Some of the powers of the LEB under R.A. No. 7662 can be harmonized with the Constitution. For instance, Section 7(c) of R.A. No. 7662 states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 7. Powers and Functions.</b> - For the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Act, the Board shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) to set the standards of accreditation for law schools taking into account, among others, the size of enrollment, the qualifications of the members of the faculty, the library and other facilities, <b>without encroaching upon the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning[.]</b> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Said provision states that the LEB has the power to set the standards of accreditation for law schools. However, it also provides for a reasonable limitation on the exercise of such power: it should not encroach the academic freedom of institutions of higher learning. With this, the law schools are safeguarded that the LEB will not arbitrarily exercise its power to set the standards of accreditation because of the reasonable limitation of academic freedom. This reasonable limitation should also be read together with the, other powers provided by R.A. No. 7662 so that the LEB will not encroach upon the constitutional rights of law schools. Pursuant to this interpretation, majority of the powers of the LEB listed under the law will conform to the organic law and the Court will not be required to pass upon the constitutionality of these statutory provisions.<br><br>However, under Section 7 of R.A. No. 7662, there is a provision that is inescapably unconstitutional. No amount of judicial interpretation can evade the inevitable conclusion that this provision violates the Constitution. Section 7(h) of R.A. No. 7662 states:<br><blockquote>Section 7. Powers and Functions. - For the purpose of achieving the objectives of this Act, the Board shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(h) to adopt a system of continuing legal education. For this purpose, the Board may provide for the mandatory attendance of <b>practicing lawyers</b> in such courses and for such duration as the Board may deem necessary[.] (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The provision clearly covers the continuing legal education of practicing lawyers. However, Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court has the exclusive judicial power to: "[p]romulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, <b>practice</b>, and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated Bar, and legal assistance to the under-privileged." Accordingly, only the Court has the power to prescribe rules with respect to the continuing practice of lawyers.<br><br>Pursuant to this judicial power, the Court issued Bar Matter No. 850 dated August 22, 2000, adopting the rules on Mandatory Continuing Legal Education for members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (<i>IBP</i>). Continuing legal education is required of members of the IBP to ensure that throughout their career, they keep abreast with law and jurisprudence, maintain the ethics of the profession and enhance the standards of the practice of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Here, Section 7(h) covers the continuing legal education of practicing lawyers. Evidently, this encroaches upon the power of the Court to promulgate rules on the practice of lawyers. The objective of R.A. No. 7662 is only to effect reforms in the Philippine legal education, not in the legal profession. In his Explanatory Note in B.M. No. 979-B, Associate Justice Jose C. Vitug stated that the concept of continuing legal education encompasses not only law students but also the members of the legal profession. The inclusion of the continuing legal education under R.A. No. 7662 implies that the LEB has jurisdiction over the education of persons who have finished the law course and are already licensed to practice law. In other words, this particular power, directly involves members of the legal profession, which is outside the realm of R.A. No. 7662. Undeniably, Section 7(h) of R.A. No. 7662 is unconstitutional because it violates Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution.<br><br><i>Fate of the Legal Education Board</i><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> states that LEB Memorandum Orders and Circular regarding the PhilSAT are unconstitutional because these do not meet the fair, reasonable, and equitable admission and academic requirements. Nevertheless, it states that Section 7(e) of R.A. No. 7662 is constitutional insofar as it gives the LEB, an agency of the executive branch, the power to prescribe the minimum requisites for admission to legal education.<br><br>I concur.<br><br>Although PhilSAT is declared unconstitutional for employing unreasonable means for the admission of students to law schools, the LEB still has numerous powers and responsibilities under its charter. As stated above, one of its vital functions is its power to accredit and set the standards of accreditation for law schools taking into account, among others, the size of enrollment, the qualifications of the members of the faculty, the library and other facilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> If a law school is underperforming, the LEB may withdraw or downgrade the accreditation status of such law school, especially if it fails to maintain the required standards. This is an important role in ensuring that law schools keep an adequate, satisfactory, and respectable curriculum program for its law students.<br><br>Likewise, I agree with the Office of the Solicitor General that the powers and functions of the LEB should be read in accordance with its mandate to guide law students and law schools.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> R.A. No. 7662 should not be interpreted to include matters that are already within the exclusive jurisdiction of Court, such as the bar examinations, law student practice, and the practice of law.<br><br>In addition, the powers and functions of the LEB should always be interpreted in light of the institutes of higher learning's academic freedom. Thus, the LEB should consider the academic freedom of law schools when it issues orders, circulars, and regulations under its power of supervision. The Constitution bestows institutes of higher learning academic freedom, which is fu1iher compromised of several freedoms. These freedoms may only be subjected to reasonable limitations. Anything beyond reasonable, or arbitrary, shall be considered an infringement of such freedoms.<br><br>The importance of LEB's role in improving the legal education in our country cannot be overemphasized. It can bridge the gap between the different law schools from the capital cities to the far-flung areas in the provinces. It can conduct studies and give recommendations on how to improve the state of legal education. It can also promote the innovative approaches in the holistic study of law. This can be achieved if the LEB is open and willing to coordinate, through consultations and meetings, with the various stakeholders, law schools, government agencies, and the Supreme Court.<br><br><b>However, the LEB should be strictly warned that it should not gravely abuse its discretion.</b> Otherwise, the Court will not think twice in striking down any arbitrary exercise of power, including those that violate the fundamental rights of institutions of higher learning under their academic freedom.<br><br><i>Conclusion</i><br></masscases.com></https:></https:></http:></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: www.="" ust.edu.ph="" civil-law=""><https: arellanolaw.edu="" alpr="" v4n1c.pdf=""><https: supreme.justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 22="" 1=""><masscases.com cases="" sjc="" 61="" 61mass53.html=""><br></masscases.com></https:></https:></http:></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: www.="" ust.edu.ph="" civil-law=""><https: arellanolaw.edu="" alpr="" v4n1c.pdf=""><https: supreme.justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 22="" 1=""><masscases.com cases="" sjc="" 61="" 61mass53.html="">I sincerely believe that it is now high time to develop, innovate, modernize, and improve the legal education system in our country. The petitions at bench are valuable opportunities for the esteemed members of the Court to discuss and examine the current and future state of legal education in the country. The different stakeholders must assess and recommend innovations and improvements in the country's state of legal education in view of the changes brought about by the developments in law, the needs of the people, and technological innovations. Verily, the stakeholders should be concerned in remodeling legal education because it is an indisputable fact that legal education is the very foundation upon which the exercise of the law profession rests.<br><br>The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the practice of law is imbued with public interest, and that a lawyer owes substantial duties, not only to his client, but also to his brethren in the profession, to the courts, and to the public, and takes part in the administration of justice, one of the most important functions of the State, as an officer of the court. Accordingly, lawyers are bound to maintain, not only a high standard of legal proficiency, but also of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>This goal of remodeling legal education will be realized through a multi-sectoral approach of cooperation, initiative, and the promotion of free­thinking. The outdated, obsolete, and unproductive aspects in legal education that cause disadvantageous effects to the study of law should definitely be set aside. It must be underscored that the purpose of the study of law is not only to successfully hurdle the bar examinations, but also to produce competent and noble lawyers who shall represent and stand up for justice, truth, and equity for the benefit and welfare of the Filipino people.<br><br>I vote to <b>PARTLY GRANT</b> the consolidated petitions. The PhilSAT should be <b>SET ASIDE</b>. It must be the law schools of the Philippines, through the Philippine Association of Law Schools, under the supervision of the Legal Education Board, which should formulate the unified and standardized law admission examination, carrying only reasonable fees and accessible to all aspiring law students.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Heirs of Piedad v.

They are laden with perks and advantages that are sorely denied others. Yet this is not discrimination.

I would like to say that in my view there is a slogan when we speak of quality of education that I feel we should be aware of, which is, "Better than ever is not enough."

I now endeavour to do this and more.<br><br><center><b>THOUGHTFUL RUMINATIONS</b></center><br><b>First.</b> I have been confronted with the idea that as regards <b>education in institutions of higher learning</b>, the State's supervisory and regulatory power is only an <b><i>auxiliary</i></b> power in relation to educational institutions, be it basic, secondary, or higher education. It has been said that this must be necessarily so because the right and duty to educate, being part and parcel of youth-rearing, does not inure to the State at the first instance. Rather, it belongs essentially and naturally to the parents who surrender it by delegation to the educational institutions.<br><br>I beg to differ. It is well-taken if this idea were referring only to <b><i>pre­school</i></b> or <b><i>elementary school</i></b> students. But the cases here are not about the education of young and impressionable children. They are about <i>the education which molds an individual into a legal professional</i>, the one whom another would meet to seek help about his or her life, liberty, or property. Nor are the cases here about nurturing generally socially acceptable values.<br><br>They are about piecing together building blocks <i>to develop focused core values essential to professions, including the legal profession</i>. With respect to the latter, regardless of how a potential student of law has been reared by his or her or its natural or surrogate parents, <b>he or she must learn focused core values that the confluence of private and public communities relevant to the legal profession has judged to be important</b>. In fact, <b>some of these focused core values may be different from the basic values which the potential student of law may have been taught at home</b>.<br><br><b>For example:<br></b><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="49%"><div align="center">Home Values</div></td><td width="51%"><div align="center">Lawyer's Values</div></td></tr><tr><td>1.

The Supreme Court <b>will also have to intervene when its power to administer admission to the Bar</b> is infringed. <b>Admission to law school is far different from admission to the Bar.</b> As the <i>Decision</i> has aptly discussed, <b>historically, textually, practicably</b>, and <b>legally</b>, there has been <b>no</b> demonstrable assignment of the function to supervise and regulate legal education to the Supreme Court.<br><br><b>Textual.</b> The confusion regarding the Supreme Court's supervisory and regulatory role stems from Subsection 5(5) of Article VIII of the <i>Constitution</i> which enunciates <i>the power of the Supreme Court to promulgate rules concerning the admission to the practice of law</i>.<br><br><i>Admission to the practice of law</i>, however, <b>is not the same as</b> <i>law school admission</i>, which is part and parcel of legal education regulation and supervision. The former presupposes the completion of a law degree and the submission of an application for the Bar examinations, among others.

Legal education and law schools <b>have been consistently placed</b> for supervision and regulation under the jurisdiction of the legislature, and in turn, the country's education departments.<br><br>For instance, it was the <i>University of the Philippines College of Law</i> which pioneered the legal education curriculum in the Philippines. <b>On the basis of statutory authority</b>, the <i>Bureau of Private Schools</i> acted as supervisor of law schools and national coordinator of law deans. Thereafter, the <i>Bureau of Higher Education</i> regulated law schools. Still further later, <i>DECS Order No. 27-1989, series of 1989</i> outlined the policies and standards for legal education, qualifications, and functions of a law dean, and qualifications, compensation and conditions of employment of law faculty, formulated a law curriculum, and imposed law admission standards.<br><br><b>Impracticable.</b> The Supreme Court <b>has no office and staff</b> dedicated to the task of supervising and regulating legal education and law schools.

The <b>reason</b> is that <b>this task involves administrative functions</b> - "those which involve the regulation and control over the conduct and affairs of individuals for their own welfare and the promulgation of rules and regulations to better carry out the policy of the legislature or such as are devolved upon the administrative agency by the organic law of its existence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><i>Manila Electric Co. v.

In that case, a petition was filed requesting the members of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, to fix the terms and the compensation to be paid to Manila Electric Company for the use of right of way. The Court held that it would be improper and illegal for the members of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, whose decision shall be final, to act on the petition of Manila Electric Company. The Court explained:<br><blockquote>We run counter to this dilemma. Either the members of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, exercise judicial functions, or as members of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, <b>exercise administrative or <i>quasi</i> judicial functions</b>. The first case would appear not to fall within the jurisdiction granted the Supreme Court. Even conceding that it does, it would presuppose the right to bring the matter in dispute before the courts, for any other construction would tend to oust the courts of jurisdiction and render the award a nullity. But if this be the proper construction, <b>we would then have the anomaly of a decision by the members of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, taken therefrom to the courts and eventually coming before the Supreme Court, where the Supreme Court would review the decision of its members acting as arbitrators</b>. Or in the second case, <b>if the functions performed by the members of the Supreme Court, sitting as a board of arbitrators, be considered as administrative or <i>quasi</i> judicial in nature, that would result in the performance of duties which the members of the Supreme Court could not lawfully take it upon themselves to perform</b>. The present petition also furnishes an apt illustration of another anomaly, for we find the Supreme Court as a court asked to determine if the members of the court may be constituted a board of arbitrators, which is not a court at all.<br><br>The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands represents one of the three divisions of power in our government. <b>It is judicial power and judicial power only which is exercised by the Supreme Court.

This <b>rational connection</b> is <i>intuitive, logical</i>, and <i>common-sensical</i>. <b>Prescribing these minimum standards</b> can lead to and accomplish the <b>objectives</b> of Subsection 7(e) as they favorably affect the <b>quality of students</b> that a law school admits as well as the <b>quality of law faculty</b> who in turn <b>mentors</b> the students whose aptitude for law studies has been tested. In the words of Professor Bernas, paraphrasing the Constitutional Commission:<br><blockquote>. . . . the <b>duty of providing quality education entails the duty of screening those who seek education</b>. Necessarily too, <b>the talent that is required in order to merit quality education goes up as one goes higher in the educational ladder of progression</b> . . . . However, as already seen, there is also recognition of the right of school to impose admission standards. <b>The state itself may also set admission standards.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>Subsection 7(e) <b>impairs the right of a citizen to select</b> a profession and a course of study <i>and</i> the <b>academic freedom</b> of every law school only <b>as little as reasonably possible</b>. For Subsection 7(e) prescribes only <b>minimum</b> standards of law admission and faculty competence and compensation.<br><br>This provision is <b>not overinclusive</b> or <b>underinclusive</b> as the <b>minimum</b> standards <b>do not impact</b> on aspects of a citizen's right to select a profession or course of study <i>or</i> the academic freedom of a law school <b>other than</b> the <i>admission of students</i> into a <i>law degree program</i> of a <i>law school</i>.<br><br>Subsection 7(e) is tailor-fit to the objective of <b>fostering law student success</b> in law school and <b>ensuring competent law faculty</b> to teach these students.<br><br>It is <b>reasonable to assume</b> that <i>every self-respecting law school</i> would see Subsection 7(e)'s requirements of <i>minimum standards for law admission</i> and <i>faculty compensation and competence</i> as <b>necessary ingredients</b> of <b>quality</b> legal education, and that these minimum requisites would <b>coincide</b> with each law school's good practices in administering legal education.<br><br>At the <b>final stage</b> of the <b>proportionality analysis</b>, there is <b>proportionality between</b> the <b>overall salutary effects of the objectives of Subsection 7(e)</b> and the <b>deleterious impact of prescribing minimum standards for admission of students in law schools and minimum qualifications and compensation for the law faculty</b>.<br><br>The <b>benefits</b> obtained from <b>achieving the objectives</b> are obvious. <i>No one can argue</i> against students who are <b>academically competent</b> and have a <b>personality</b> ready for the rigors of legal education. It will spare both the law student and the law school of the waste of time, expense, and trauma of not being able to fit in and succeed. <b>Minimum</b> standards for law admission and law faculty competence and compensation are base-line <b>predictors of success in law school and quality of the legal education</b> it offers. Professor Bernas and the Constitutional Commission, as quoted above, shared this observation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the <b>deleterious effect</b> of the <b>imposition of such minimum standards</b> is speculative<br><br>In the first place, <b>petitioners offered no evidence</b> of the <b>oppressive</b> or <b>discriminatory nature</b> and <b>other evils</b> that could be attributed to the prescription of such minimum standards.

Actually, it is <i>difficult to imagine how the narrative of quality legal education</i> <b>could not lead to</b> the <i>imposition of standards referred to in Subsection 7(e)</i>. This <b>intuitive justification</b> for these measures was <b>not lost on the Constitutional Commission</b> who believed that the duty to provide and promote <b>quality education</b> demanded the screening of students for base-line competencies:<br><blockquote>[T]he <b>duty of providing quality education entails the duty of screening those who seek education</b>.

Thus:<br><blockquote>1. Policy and Rationale. - <b>To improve the quality of legal education</b>, all those seeking admission to the basic law courses leading to either a Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor degree shall be <b>required to take</b> the Philippine Law School Admission Test (PhiLSAT), a nationwide uniform admission test to be administered under the control and supervision of the [Legal Education Board].<br><br>2. Test Design. - The PhiLSAT shall be designed as a <b>one-day aptitude test that can measure the academic potential of the examinee to pursue the study of law</b>. It shall <b>test communications and language proficiency, critical thinking skills, and verbal and quantitative reasoning</b>. (<i>emphasis added</i>)</blockquote><b>No. 1 of LEBMO No. 7</b> states the <b>animating purpose, <i>to improve the quality of legal education</i></b>, for requiring the <b>taking</b> of the <b>PhiLSAT</b> by applicants for admission to a law school.<br><br>No. 2 of LEBMO No. 7 <b>provides the mechanism for achieving</b> No. 1.<br><br><b>Nos. 7 and 9 of LEBMO No. 7</b> further clarify <b>how PhiLSAT would be used to measure</b> the <b>academic potential</b> of an applicant to a law school:<br><blockquote>7. Passing Score - The <b>cut off or passing score</b> for the PhilSAT shall be <b>FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT (55%) correct answers</b>, or such percentile score as may be prescribed by the LEB.<br><br>8. Test Results - Every examinee who passed the PhilSAT shall be issued by the testing administrator a CERTIFICATE OF LEGIBILITY (COE), which shall contains the examinees test score/rating and general average to the bachelor's degree completed. Examinees who fail to meet the cut-off or passing score shall by issued a Certificate of Grade containing his/her test score/rating. The COE shall be valid for two (2) years and shall be submitted to the admitting law school by the applicant.<br><br>9. Admission Requirement - All college graduates or graduating students <b>applying for admission to the basic law course</b> shall be <b>required to pass the PhilSAT as a requirement for admission to any law School in the Philippines</b>. Upon the affectivity of this memorandum order, no applicant shall be admitted for enrollment as a first year student in the basic law courses leading to a degree of either Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor unless he/she has passed the PhilSAT taken within 2 years before the start of studies for the basic law course and presents a valid COE as proof thereof. (<i>emphasis added</i>)</blockquote>This stage of the analysis requires us to refer to <b>Nos. 10 and 11 of LEBMO No. 7</b>:<br><blockquote>10. Exemption. - Honor graduates granted professional civil service professional eligibility pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 907 who are enrolling within two (2) years from their college graduation are exempted from taking and passing the PhiLSAT from for purposes of admission to the basic law course.<br><br>11. Institutional Admission Requirements. - The PhiLSAT shall be without prejudice to the right of a law school in the exercise of its academic freedom to prescribe or impose <b>additional</b> requirements for admission, <b><u><i>such as but not limited to</i></u></b>:<br><br>a. A score in the PhiLSAT higher than the cut-off or passing score set by the LEB;<br><br>b. Additional or supplemental admission tests to measure the competencies and/or personality of the applicant; and<br><br>c. Personal interview of the applicant (<i>emphasis added</i>)</blockquote><b>No. 11 of LEBMO No. 7</b> itself <b>expressly recognizes</b> the <b>right of law schools</b> to <b>impose screening measures in addition to</b> the <b>taking</b> or <b>writing</b> of <b>PhiLSAT</b>, <u><b><i>such as but not limited to</i></b></u> a <b>PhiLSAT score of higher than 55%, additional admission tests</b>, and <b>personal interview</b> of the <b>applicant</b>.<br><br>The law school <b>may also opt to rely solely on the result of the PhiLSAT</b> in accepting students.<br><br>The <b>additional requirements</b> that <b>a law school</b> may <b>impose</b> would have to be <b>of the same kind</b> as a <b>PhiLSAT score of higher than 55%, additional admission tests</b>, or a <b>personal interview of the applicant</b> - the <b><i>defining characteristic</i></b> of the specie in the enumeration is the <b><i>ability to measure the competencies and/or personality of the applicant relevant to and indicative of an applicant's success in law school</i></b> - an applicant's <i>communications or language proficiency, critical thinking skills, and verbal and quantitative reasoning, and personality fit for success in law school</i>. So <b>any screening module that makes such measurements</b> could be imposed as an <b>additional measure</b>.<br><br>On the other hand, <b>No. 10 of LEBMO No. 7</b> provides for an exemption from both writing and passing PhiLSAT. This, however, <b>does not exempt</b> an applicant from the <b>other admission requirements of a law school</b> if one has been imposed.<br><br>Thus, the <b>scheme</b> under LEBMO No. 7 can be summarized as follows:<br><br>1. <b>Objective</b>: to measure the <b>academic potential</b> of an applicant to a law school to pursue a law degree <b>in terms of baseline competencies</b> in <i>communications or language proficiency, critical thinking skills, and verbal and quantitative reasoning</i>.<br><br>2. <b>Means:</b> (a) <b>writing</b> the one-day aptitude test on communications or language proficiency, critical thinking skills, and verbal and quantitative reasoning, and <b>passing</b> this test with a score of 55% of correct answers; (b) <b>non-admission</b> of applicants who score less than 55% in PhiLSAT and <b>imposition of administrative fine</b> against law schools admitting law students who did not write or pass PhiLSAT; and (c) <b>law school admission requirements in addition</b> to writing and passing PhiLSAT, if any.<br><br>3. <b>Exemption:</b> as stated in No. 10 of LEBMO No. 7.<br><br>PhiLSAT as an admission requirement is <b>reasonable</b> because it is <b>minimally impairing of academic freedom</b>.<br><br>The <b>scope of the area</b> measured by PhiLSAT is <b>limited to academic potential</b> - <i>communications or language proficiency, critical thinking skills, and verbal and quantitative reasoning</i> - and <b>does not extend to an applicant's personality or emotional quotient</b>.<br><br>PhiLSAT <b>competencies</b> are the <b>most basic of skills needed to survive as</b> and <b>gain something from being</b>, a law student. There is <b>nothing fancy, whimsical</b> or <b>arbitrary</b> about these competencies. PhiLSAT <b>does not intrude</b> into a law school's decision to prescribe <b>other admission requirements</b> covering other sets of skills.<br><br>Further, PhiLSAT's <b>passing score</b> is <b><i>minimal - 55%</i></b>. If an applicant <b>cannot even obtain a score of at least 55% in this test</b> involving the <b>most basic of skills required</b> in a law school, then <b>the applicant's aptitude must lie somewhere else</b>.<br><br>A snapshot or sample of PhiLSAT questions bears this out:<br><br><b>TEST A.

It is <b>only this minimal requirement</b> of <i>writing and passing PhiLSAT at the very reasonable score of 55% on multiple choice questions that reflects an applicant's capacity for reading, writing, computing and analyzing individual questions and fact scenarios</i>, <b>which the State demands of every law school to factor in as an admission requirement</b>.<br><br>More, a law school <b>may admit as students</b> those <i>who have not written and passed PhiLSAT but have obtained professional civil service eligibility</i> within two years from the date of their graduation in college.<br><br>In addition, a law school <i>desirous of proving the propriety of another exemption from taking and passing PhiLSAT</i> can very well <b>petition the Legal Education Board</b> for this purpose.<br><br>To repeat, <b>While LEBMO No. 7 impacts on a law school's academic freedom, the impairment is minimal and based on rational considerations</b>.<br><br>As regards individual applicants to law school, the <b>demand</b> and <b>effect</b> of PhiLSAT upon them <b>thoughtfully account for</b> their <b>dignity</b> as individuals. This is because <b>PhiLSAT relieves an applicant</b> of the <i>potential pain and agony of unmet expectations</i> and <i>wastage of time, resources and efforts</i>. Unsuccessful PhiLSAT examinees may have their aptitude in something else.<br><br>In any event, the <b>scheme</b> under LEBMO No. 7 <b>is also very accommodating</b> of applicants who fail the test. PhiLSAT is now <b>offered twice a year</b>, and an applicant <b>can write it as many times</b> as he or she is willing to take.<br><br>To stress anew, PhiLSAT as envisioned in LEBMO No. 7 <b>minimally impairs</b> the limited <i>right of a citizen to select a profession or a course of study</i> and a <i>law school's academic freedom</i>, is <b>consistent with</b> the <i>State's power of reasonable regulation and supervision of all educational institutions</i>, and is therefore <b>reasonable</b>.<br><br>I conclude, therefore, that there is <b>proportionality</b> between the <b>overall salutary effects of the objectives of PhiLSAT</b> and the <b>deleterious effect of passing PhiLSAT</b> as an admission requirement.<br><br>As in the case for Subsection 7(e), the <b>benefits obtained from achieving the objectives</b> are obvious - <i>no one can argue against students who have been measured to have the necessary skills in communications and language, critical thinking, and verbal and quantitative reasoning</i>. On the other hand, the <b>deleterious effect of the imposition of PhiLSAT</b> to stress anew is <b>speculative</b>. There is in fact <b>no evidence of the evils</b> that could be attributed to this minimal admission requirement. It <b>has not been shown</b> that <i>PhiLSAT questions are arbitrary</i>, the <i>test results are oppressive to the examinees (in fact, as shown above, <b>easily more than half</b> of the applicants have passed the first versions of PhiLSAT)</i>, <b>or</b> <i>the scope of PhiLSAT has occupied the</i> <b>entire field of admission standards</b> and <i>has left nothing for law schools to prescribe</i>. These allegations <b>have not been proven</b> to be true.<br><br><b>Existence of Transparency and Intelligibility.</b> PhiLSAT has had a <b>long history of validation and re-validation</b> that both the <i>Decision</i> and the <i>Memorandum</i> of the Office of the Solicitor General have been able to recount succinctly. The <b>bases for which PhiLSAT</b> was <b>conceived</b> and <b>required</b> for applicants to law school have thus been <b>made transparent and intelligible</b>. One can therefore concede that <b>PhiLSAT</b> was <b>not the result</b> of an <i>arbitrary and capricious exercise of wisdom</i> by its authors.<br><br><b>Action as being within a range of possible, acceptable and defensible outcomes.</b> It is open to the Legal Education Board to impose PhiLSAT as one of several measures to achieve the constitutional objective of quality education. In fact, a <b>mandatory law school admission test</b> was <b>one of the reform agenda to improve the quality of the instruction</b> given by law schools as recommended by the Court's <i>Special Study group on Bar Examination Reforms</i>, and later, by the <i>Committee on Legal Education and Bar Matters</i> and the Court's <i>Bar Matter No. 1161</i>.<br><br>To reiterate, <b>both</b> Subsection 7(e) of RA 7662 and LEBMO Order No. 7 on PhiLSAT are <b>reasonable</b> forms of State regulation and supervision of law schools.<br><br><b>I also reflect on some of the <i>Decision's</i> ratio.</b><br><br>I refer to the <b>presumption that the legislature intended to enact a valid, sensible and just law</b> and <b>one which operates no further than may be necessary to effectuate the specific purpose of the law</b>. In a word, Subsection 7(e) and LEBMO No. 7 are <b>presumed to be reasonable</b>.<br><br>As <b>reasonableness is a fact-heavy determination</b>, <i>absent evidence of unreasonableness from petitioners</i>, it would be <b>speculative to jump to the conclusion</b> that <i>PhiLSAT is in fact unreasonable</i>. Petitioners need to prove facts to disprove the presumption.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>I agree that the subject of PhiLSAT is to improve the quality of legal education, which falls squarely within the scope of police power.<br><br>But I do not agree that PhiLSAT is irrelevant to such purpose and that it is further arbitrary and oppressive. In the first place, I do not share the view that there is an apparent discord between the purpose of improving legal education and prescribing a qualifying and restrictive examination because the design of the PhiLSAT itself appears to be disconnected with the aptitude for law that it seeks to measure. The discussions above should prove that PhiLSAT is <b>not only relevant</b> to the objectives set out by the <i>Constitution</i> and RA 7662 <b>but is also proportionate</b> as a means to these objectives.<br><br>Notably, <b>petitioners presented no evidence on these factual issues</b>. Hence, it cannot be said that the ratio in the <i>Decision</i> is based on facts and circumstances. There is not even a discussion in the <i>Decision</i> on the structure and contents of the PhiLSAT tests that have been administered thus far. To be sure, the <b>absence of an evidentiary record makes the <i>Decision's</i> conclusions at best speculative</b>.<br><br>An evidentiary record is important because the <i>Decision</i> itself recognizes the presumption that the legislature intended to enact a valid, sensible and just law and one which operates no further than may be necessary to effectuate the specific purpose of the law. Yet, although petitioners adduced no contrary evidence, the <i>Decision</i> goes on to conclude that the presumption of validity has been rebutted.<br><br>If there is any <b>evidence on record</b> here, <b>it is to the effect that LEBMO No. 7's PhiLSAT actually measures a potential law student's aptitude for law</b>. As the <i>Decision</i> itself acknowledges, the PhiLSAT is essentially an aptitude test measuring the examinee's communications and language proficiency, critical thinking, verbal and quantitative reasoning, and that i was designed to measure the academic potential of the examinee to pursue the study of law.<br><br>There is <b>no denying</b> that the <b>ability to read a large volume of material in English</b> and <b>write, think and argue in English are important indicators</b> of <b>one's ability to complete a law degree</b>. While PhiLSAT is <b>not an exact predictor of success</b> in law school, it is its <b>undeniable</b> role in <b>measuring a student's strong potentials for success</b> that must be taken into account.<br><br>Further, as the <i>Decision</i> itself notes, the Court, through <i>Resolution</i> dated September 4, 2001, <b>approved the recommendations</b> of our own Committee on Legal Education and Bar Matters, including "d) to prescribe minimum standards for admission to law schools <b>including a system of law aptitude examination</b>[.]" The Court <i>could not have recommended a measure</i> that would have been an unreasonable imposition on potential students of law or on academic freedom.<br><br>Some law schools are already imposing strict admission standards. That is true. <b>But</b> this fact does not automatically render PhiLSAT irrelevant or unreasonable.<br><br><b>PhiLSAT would not have come into being had there been no legitimate concerns about improving the state of our legal education.</b> The top law schools are precisely top law schools <b>because of strict admission standards</b> they have in place.<br><br>These law schools, however, are <b>not the only law schools</b> in the Philippines. They do <b>not have the monopoly of law students</b> in the country. In fact, <b>they are only a minority</b>. There are so many more law schools and law students out there, whose state of competencies LEBMO No. 7 seeks to capture.<br><br>It is also a contradiction in terms that we <i>land the best admission standards and practices of some law schools</i>, <b>yet reject the passing of PhiLSAT as a requirement for law school admission</b>. <b>Their standards and practices indubitably prove a reasonable connection</b> <i>between the regulation of admissions to legal education</i> <b>and</b> <i>in ensuring that those allowed to study law and eventually allowed to practice law are competent, knowledgeable or morally upright</i>.<br><br><b>But these law schools are not the reason why</b> we are debating about how to improve legal education standards. If <b>every</b> law school has exercised responsibly their role in ensuring that admission standards and practices are up to par with quality legal education, we would not be talking about requiring PhiLSAT anymore.<br><br>The indubitable social and legislative facts prove that . a screening mechanism like PhiLSAT is necessary. If we are again going; the way of making such screening mechanism an optional device for law school admission, as the <i>Decision</i> does, <b>then the Court is not just overhauling the undeniable social and legislative facts upon which Subsection 7(e) of RA 7662 was based, the <i>Decision</i> is also turning its back to the problems that have long beset our legal education</b>.<br><br><i>Common sense dictates</i> that the <i>absence of filters would clog sooner than later the pipeline of knowledge</i>. <b>PhiLSAT acts as that filter</b> which <i>removes students whose capacity, values, forbearance and aptitude may not be for the study of law</i>. This is <b>true for aspiring law students</b> (there must be a State-imposed method to determine an entry level student's aptitude, capacity, forbearance and values for law study) as <b>it is true for those who want to be appointed to the Bench</b> (where the battery of tests administered by the JBC presumably makes not only for a fair selection process but also for a pool of competent aspirants).<br><br>I <b>do not agree</b> that the imposition of the PhiLSAT cut off score was made without the benefit of a prior scientific study, thereby making it arbitrary. To my mind, this is a <b>reversal of the onus</b> of who proves what. Since the <i>Decision admits the existence of the presumption</i> that the <b>legislature intended to enact a valid, sensible and just law</b> and one which <b>operates no further than may be necessary to effectuate the specific purpose of the law</b>, it is <b>up to the petitioners to establish</b> that Congress - both the House and the Senate - and the Legal Education Board acted arbitrarily. <b>Petitioners did not adduce evidence to this effect.</b><br><br>On the contrary, the other Branches of Government have tests validating PhiLSAT. It is <b>not for these Branches of Government to explain the relevance and validity</b> of these studies if, on their face, these studies appear to be relevant. The <b>actions of these Branches of Government are entitled to deference</b> not only because of the presumption above-mentioned but also due to their status as agents of sovereignty. Again, the <b>burden is on petitioners to prove by evidence their claim</b> that PhiLSAT is arbitrary for having been imposed without prior scientific study, or that petitioners' own studies disprove the presumption.<br><br>I also do not think that it is arbitrary and harsh to impose penalties upon law schools that do not make PhiLSAT a requirement for law school admission.<br><br>Again, <b>petitioners have not adduced evidence</b> that <i>unduly oppressiveness</i> will be the case. In any event, <b>there is nothing oppressive about penalizing an entity that does not comply with regulations</b>. This set­up of regulatory and even criminal penalties <b>has been done so often</b> to deter violations and enforce obedience. This is especially true <i>where the regulation involved is intended towards a socially positive and uplifting goal</i>, but <i>compliance is not assured</i>.<br><br>In addition, <b>whether to attach a penalty to a measure is a policy and not a legal decision</b>. The decision to impose a penalty <b>speaks to the utility and wisdom or desirability</b> of the manner by which breach of the regulation is deterred, and compliance, maximized.<br><br>There is, too, further <b>nothing abusive about the scoring methodology</b> in LEBMO No. 7. It is <b>common among law schools that examinations are graded based on a minimum percentage of correct answers</b> and <b>not on a percentile score</b>. The <b>Supreme Court's Bar examinations</b> are <b>scored on the basis of correct and wrong answers</b>, and <b>passers are those who reach the minimum required scores</b>.<br><br>The ruling in <i>Tablarin</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> is relevant. This case law focused on the validity of the National Medical Admissions Test (NMAT) as a valid and reasonable police power measure as an admission standard into medical schools. <i>Tablarin</i> held that NMAT is an educational regulatory tool related to one of the legitimate objectives of police power - public order, specifically, securing of the health and physical safety and wellbeing of the population. <i>Tablarin</i> also recognized that though NMAT is at the most initial and lowest rung of the requisites to attain this police power objective, NMAT is nonetheless an essential part of the police power objective. <i>Tablarin</i> confirmed that <b>NMAT serves as a gate-keeping measure to weed out misfits</b> in the sense of those whose aptitude and inclinations are not for the field of medicine. The fact that NMAT was described by the Court as a factor in becoming better doctors (or medical practitioners) does not detract from the ruling in <i>Tablarin</i> that <b>NMAT is first and foremost a legitimate screening device for those wishing to be admitted to medical schools</b>.<br><br>Hence, <b>NMAT serves the same function as that of PhiLSAT</b>. Because PhiLSAT is the NMAT equivalent in essential respects, the ruling in <i>Tablarin</i> justifying NMAT as a legitimate police power exercise should also apply to the cases-at-bar about PhiLSAT.<br><br><b>PhiLSAT serves an equivalent function as the LSAT.</b> LSAT is a standardised test designed to identify individuals who are likely to succeed in first year law school. <b>Unlike in PhiLSAT which is a State-sponsored measure</b>, all law schools in North America require applicants to take LSAT. LSAT is administered by a non-profit corporation located in the United States.<br><br><b>LSAT, like PhiLSAT, is a screening device for entry into the great learning of the law.</b> The <b>theory</b> behind both LSAT and PhiLSAT is that <b>law schools seek students who have substantial promise for success in law school, and as a result, a strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law as shown by their preliminary aptitude for law</b>.<br><br>To be sure, we <b>cannot distance or segregate law school experience from the practice of law</b> because the former should ideally segue to the latter. Law schools <b>do not exist exclusively just to teach law students</b>; law schools <b>are also there to transform their students into lawyers</b>. It is unrealistic to say otherwise.<br><br>If law schools were to simply exist to teach <i>without regard to whether their students become lawyers</i>, <b>law school education would lose both its clientele and its relevance in the real world</b> - this is the common sensical and obvious context of the educative process. Despite the division of authority as between legal education and practice of law and the obvious difference between them, in reality, <b>one bridges to the other as one cannot be dissociated from the other</b>.<br><br>The difference between LSAT and PhiLSAT is not conceptual but operational - that is, how much weight is to be given by institutions of higher learning - the law schools - to the scores obtained by an examinee. They also differ in the scoring system - LSAT is percentile-based while PhiLSAT as now envisioned is raw score-based.<br><br>Most law schools in common law countries <b>have several streams</b> about how an applicant is to be admitted as a law student. The <b>most common if not the only stream</b> is through high LSAT scores and grade point averages. So it is a common goal for those asp1nng to enter law schools in those countries to take LSAT and aim for high LSAT percentiles and GPAs.<br><br>Among these law schools, there may be other streams of admission ­ those who have achieved extensive relevant experiences abroad or in-country and those who would bring interesting diversity to the law school student population. <b>But the number of these students vis-a-vis the entire population of law students in a law school is miniscule.</b> The students admitted through these other streams <b>constitute a very small minority</b> of the entire population of law students.<br><br><b>The majority are still required to show competence through LSAT scores.</b> The <b>lower scores an applicant has</b>, the <b>lower the chance the applicant can get to enroll in a law school</b> - IF THEY HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL.<br><br>In any event, LSAT is not anchored on a State sponsored measure. Why the countries under LSAT regimes do not require State supervision and regulation could be attributed to their perception that their law societies (the equivalent of our Integrated Bar) and law schools are mature enough to self­ regulate.<br><br>If we had no concerns about law schools which have no proportionate standards to the nobility of legal education, then perhaps we can adopt as liberal a policy as the countries utilizing LSAT and having different admission streams. But obviously, our experiences are not the same as their experiences; our situation is not similar to their situations.<br><br>In any case, <b>PhiLSAT tries to mirror the admission practices</b> where LSAT is the screening device. If LSAT <b>can be waived in exceptional circumstances, this exceptional stream where LSAT is waived</b> <b>is akin</b>, in the case of PhiLSAT, to recall from above, <b>to the <i>exemption under No. 10 of LEBMO No. 7 for honor graduates</i></b>.<br><br>PhiLSAT as embodied in LEBMO No. 7 is not objectionable for being unreasonable. Having been imposed by a law that carries the presumption of validity and reasonableness that has not been disproven by contrary evidence from petitioners' end, PhiLSAT cannot be ignored or set aside as this has been imposed by the State through an administrative regulation-LEBMO No. 7 - which finds its basis in RA 7662.<br><br>I agree with the <i>Decision</i> that the reasonable supervision and regulation clause is not a stand-alone provision but must be read in conjunction with the other constitutional provisions which include, in particular, the clause on academic freedom. I agree as well that institutions of higher learning has a wide sphere of autonomy certainly extending to the choice of students.<br><br><b>Yet, this sphere of autonomy is not absolute or limitless.</b> Autonomy cannot result in arbitrary or discriminatory admission policies. If autonomy were to have such a result, restrictive police power can curb such actuality or tendency. <b>Autonomy too cannot disregard the constitutional power of the State to exercise reasonable regulation and supervision of all educational institutions.</b> Thus, I agree with the <i>Decision</i> that affirmative police power can be legitimately exercised in the regulation and supervision of institutions of higher learning. The <i>Decision</i> aptly ruled that institutions of higher learning enjoy ample discretion to decide for itself who to admit, being part of their academic freedom, but the State, in the exercise of its reasonable supervision and regulation over education, can impose minimum regulations. <b><i>This is what RA 7662 and LEBMO No. 7 have done.</i></b><br><br>The <b>issue is not</b> whether the State can intervene in the admission requirements of law schools or any other institution of higher learning - <b>the rule of law has already said <i>the State can</i>. The issue is whether the degree and breadth of the intervention that the State can legally do is reasonable supervision and regulation</b>.<br><br>In this light, I do not agree that the PhiLSAT cut off score is a direct intrusion into the law school's essential freedom to choose <i>who may be admitted to study</i>. I maintain that PhiLSAT plays a viable and vital role in determining an entry law student's aptitude for law. The ability to read a large volume of materials in English and write in English are important indicators of the ability to complete a law degree. Again, while the PhiLSAT is not an exact predictor of success in law school, it is a factor that must be taken into account.<br><br>For the reasons I have stated, I <b>disagree with the <i>Decision</i></b> that in mandating that only students who scored at least 55% correct answers shall be admitted to any law school, PhiLSAT usurps the right and duty of the law school to determine for itself the criteria for the admission of students and thereafter, to apply such criteria on a case to case basis. <b>There is a way to read reason into LEBMO Order No. 7 that is neither strained nor unwarranted.</b> I have shown this in the foregoing disquisition.<br><br>Another. <b>I disagree with the <i>Decision</i></b> that the law schools are left with absolutely no discretion to choose its students in accordance with its own policies, but are dictated to surrender such discretion in favor of a State-­determined pool of applicants. <b>This is a hyperbole that finds no basis in fact and law.</b> It is <b>highly speculative</b> that the <b>complexion of the student body</b> and the <b>number of students</b> a <b>law school admits will be different</b> just because PhiLSAT was put in place. There is no evidence of that in the records. In any case, <i>the State is also a stakeholder in our educational institutions. The State cannot lightly be disregarded when it comes to reasonable minimal regulation and supervision</i>.<br><br>I therefore do not concur with the ruling that the requirement of passing the PhiLSAT insofar as admission to law school is concerned should be struck down not only for being unreasonable but also for encroaching upon the law school's exercise of discretion as to who to admit in its law program.<br><br>In practical terms, PhiLSAT is the default means by which one could become a law student. Hence, one desirous of becoming a law student would want to take and pass PhiLSAT. If he or she fails the first time, he or she can. try again and again and again. Then perhaps if one still fails PhiLSAT, legal education is not for his or her aptitude. It is not of course the end of the world. It is the door that opens to other fitting opportunities for self-improvement if not self-aggrandizement.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to affirm the constitutionality in full of Subsection 7(e) and LEBMO Order No. 7, series of 2016.</masscases.com></https:></https:></http:><http: www.="" ust.edu.ph="" civil-law=""><https: arellanolaw.edu="" alpr="" v4n1c.pdf=""><https: supreme.justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 22="" 1=""><masscases.com cases="" sjc="" 61="" 61mass53.html=""><blockquote><ol start="3"><li><b>Are Subsections 7(g) and (h) of RA 7662 <i>ultra vires</i> for encroaching into the constitutional powers of the Supreme Court.</b></li></ol></blockquote>These provisions read:<br><blockquote>(g) to establish a law practice internship as a requirement for taking the Bar which a law student shall undergo with any duly accredited private or public law office or firm or legal assistance group anytime during the law course for a specific period that the Board may decide, but not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months.

No. L-24693, July 31, 1967: "<b>Primarily what calls for a reversal of such a decision is the absence of any evidence to offset the presumption of validity that attaches to a challenged statute or ordinance</b>. As was expressed categorically by Justice Malcolm: "The presumption is all in favor of validity . . . The action of the elected representatives of the people cannot be lightly set aside . . . ." It admits of no doubt therefore that there being a presumption of validity, the necessity for evidence to rebut it is unavoidable, unless the statute or ordinance is void on its face, which is not the case here. The principle has been nowhere better expressed than in the leading case of O'Gorman &amp; Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., where the American Supreme Court through Justice Brandeis tersely and succinctly summed up the matter thus: 'The statute here questioned deals with a subject clearly within the scope of the police power. We are asked to declare it void on the ground that the specific method of regulation prescribed is unreasonable and hence deprives the plaintiff of due process of law. As underlying questions of fact may condition the constitutionality of legislation of this character, the presumption of constitutionality must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the statute.' <b>No such factual foundation being laid in the present case, the lower court deciding the matter on the pleadings and the stipulation of facts, the presumption of validity must prevail and the judgment against the ordinance set aside.</b>" (emphasis added)<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> 236 Phil. 768, (1987).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Uy Ha v.
