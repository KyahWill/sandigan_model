Joint trial on the merits thereafter ensued.<br><br>Evidence for the prosecution shows that on the evening January 13 and 21, 2011 which was a few after her 9<sup>th</sup> was sleeping in their house situated at <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> Quezon City. On that evening, she was with her father, ABC, and her three brothers, and they were all sleeping on a cushion on the floor. AAA was suddenly awakened when she felt that something round was pressed on the side of her head. When she opened her eyes, she was not able to see anything because it was dark. AAA wondered as the lights were usually turned on when they sleep. Thinking that it was one of her brother's foot that was on her face, AAA tried to remove it but she heard the voice of ABC saying, "<i>Baril ito</i>. <i>Huwag kang maingay</i>." AAA kept silent because of fear. ABC started stripping AAA by removing her t-shirt, shorts, and panty. AAA tried to put her panty back on but ABC prevailed in undressing her despite her struggle. ABC then inserted his penis into AAA's vagina until she felt that he urinated inside her vagina. After, ABC threatened to kill her brothers if AAA should tell about the incident to the police and to her <i>lola</i> EEE who reside nearby. The following morning, AAA woke up feeling a sharp pain in her vagina. When she washed, she felt that there was a wound at the tip of the center of her vagina.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>AAA testified that ABC raped her many times and sometimes twice a week especially on Saturdays an d Sundays when ABC was drunk. These unfortunate events became more frequent when ABC lost his job February 2011 which lasted for a year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Evidence for the prosecution likewise shows that on the evening between April and May, 2011, AAA's brother, DDD, was at home with his siblings, AAA, FFF and GGG. They were in bed when their father, ABC, arrived. ABC told DDD to turn off the 1ight, which he did and then to go to sleep. They all laid down facing the wall with DDD near the door, next to him was ABC, GGG, AAA, and FFF. Later, ABC moved to AAA's side. DDD was still awake at that time and he saw ABC stand up and went on top of AAA, ABC took out something which went in and out of AAA's vagina. But because the room was dimly lit, DDD testified that he only saw shadows, with the illumination coming from the moonlight outside. Thereafter, DDD saw ABC lay beside AAA, and then he eventually fell asleep. DDD did not reveal to anyone about what he saw for fear that he might not be allowed to go out of the house and that he will get spanked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>One year later, or on January 29, 2012, AAA revealed her ordeal to her aunt CCC who did not believe her initially until she showed a "kiss mark" on her breast. Immediately, CCC took AAA to the authorities where they filed a complaint against ABC. Acting on the complaint, police officers arrested ABC for investigation.<br><br>AAA was subjected to a physical and medical examination by Dr. Escaro.

There is no showing that the trial court judge overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight which would affect the result of the case, his assessment of credibility deserves this Court's highest respect.</blockquote>Moreover, in <i>People v. Bandoquillo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><blockquote>It is settled that "when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are often accorded finality" unless it is shown that the lower court had overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated some fact or circumstance of weight which, if properly considered, would have altered the result of the case.

Nonetheless, the Court had already held in <i>People v. Simon</i> that when an offense is defined in a special law but the penalty therefor is taken from the technical nomenclature in the RPC, the legal effects under the system of penalties native to the Code would necessarily apply to the special law. Thus, in <i>People v. Santos</i>, which also involved a case of acts of lasciviousness under Sec. 5 (b), Art. III of RA 7610, the Court held that in the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the minimum term shall be taken from the penalty one degree lower to the prescribed penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, that is <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum, which ranges from twelve (12) years, ten (10) months and twenty-one (21) days to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, while the maximum shall be taken from the medium period of the imposable penalty, that is <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, which ranges from fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and twenty (20) days to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and nine (9) days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Given the presence of the alternative aggravating circumstance of relationship in the instant case the perpetrator being the father of AAA and without any mitigating circumstances to offset the same, the term of the sentence was properly imposed by the appellate court in its maximum period pursuant to Section 31 (c), Article XII of R.
