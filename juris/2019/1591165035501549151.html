				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For&nbsp; consideration of this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; is the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Decision<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> dated February&nbsp; 15,2017 of the Court of Appeals <i>(CA)</i> affirming the Judgment<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> dated August 20,2014 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 25, Bifian, Laguna in Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 21888-B,&nbsp; finding&nbsp; appellants John&nbsp; Sanota&nbsp; y Sarmiento (Sanota), Deo Dayto y Genorga@ "Rubrob" (Dayto) and Rolando Espineli y Acebo @ "Landoy" <i>(Espineli) </i>guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery&nbsp; with&nbsp; Homicide as defined&nbsp; and&nbsp; penalized&nbsp; under Article&nbsp; 294&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code (RPC).<br><br>The facts follow.<br><br>According to Santiago&nbsp; Abion, Jr. <i>(Abion)</i>, on March&nbsp; 31, 2011, around 4:00 p.m.,&nbsp; he was feeding&nbsp; his ducks&nbsp; at the back of his house&nbsp; when&nbsp; he saw appellants having a drinking spree at a hut located five (5) meters away from his house.&nbsp; From a distance of three (3) meters, he overheard the three (3) appellants planning to raid a house in Hacienda 8.&nbsp; Abion also heard the same appellants saying that anyone who blocks their path will be killed. Thereafter, Abion entered his house and cooked food for dinner.&nbsp; Later, in the evening of the same day, appellant Espineli arrived at Abion's house and invited the latter to a birthday party in Don Jose, Santa Rosa, Laguna.&nbsp;&nbsp; After Abion asked permission&nbsp; from his wife, he and appellant&nbsp; Espineli&nbsp; boarded a motorcycle owned and driven by the same appellant.&nbsp; Instead of going to Don Jose, Santa Rosa, Laguna, the motorcycle headed towards Hacienda 8, and after five (5) minutes of travelling,&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; Espineli&nbsp; parked the motorcycle&nbsp; beside the road and in front of the house of Don Alfonso Quiros (Quiros). Appellant Espineli told Abion to stay put as he had to talk to his fellow security guard inside the house of Quiros.&nbsp; After a few seconds, appellants Sanota and Dayto arrived and the two asked Abion where appellant Espineli was.&nbsp; Abion told them that appellant Espineli went inside the house of Quiros and, thereafter, appellants Sanota and Dayto went inside the same house.&nbsp; Abion followed appellants Sanota and Dayto, and when he was twenty (20) meters away from the house of Quiros, he saw appellant Espineli&nbsp; handing a gun to appellant Dayto, and the latter, with a gun in his possession, climbed the window of the same house.&nbsp; After five (5) minutes, Abion heard a gunshot and saw appellant Dayto come out of the window of the house of Quiros with a gun on his right hand and a "black thing" on his left. Appellants Sanota and Dayto then fled to the forest, while appellant Espineli proceeded to where the motorcycle was parked.&nbsp; Abion also went back to the motorcycle and pretended that he didn't witness the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant Espineli drove the motorcycle and Abion alighted in Barangay&nbsp; Hernandez where the latter was told by the former to keep quiet.&nbsp; The following day, Abion heard from his neighbors that Quiros' house has been robbed and that the latter's&nbsp; son, Jose Miguel Quiros (Jose Miguel)&nbsp; was killed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abion&nbsp; pretended&nbsp; not to know about the incident, but through the prodding of his wife who works as a gardener of Quiros, he was able to execute a Sinumpaang Salaysay<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated April 5, 2011.<br><br>Thus, an Information was filed against the three (3) appellants charging them with the crime of Robbery with Homicide, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about March 31, 2011, in the City of Santa Rosa, Laguna, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above­ named&nbsp; accused, armed&nbsp; with&nbsp; a gun, conspiring, confederating, and helping one another,&nbsp; through&nbsp; the employment&nbsp; of violence&nbsp; and intimidation against Jose Miguel&nbsp; Quiros&nbsp; y Lopez, who is the son of complainant Miguel Alfonso Quiros&nbsp; y Yulo,&nbsp; with&nbsp; intent&nbsp; to gain,&nbsp; and without&nbsp; the consent&nbsp; of the owner thereof,&nbsp; did then and there willfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and rob one (1) Asus Laptop worth Twenty[-]Seven Thousand Pesos (P27,000.00) owned&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; and&nbsp; belonging to&nbsp; complainant&nbsp; Miguel&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfonso Quiros&nbsp; y Yulo, to the damage&nbsp; and prejudice&nbsp; of the latter of the value of the said&nbsp; laptop&nbsp; in the amount&nbsp; of P27,000.00 Philippine&nbsp; Currency and that&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; or&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Robbery&nbsp; accused&nbsp;&nbsp; DEO&nbsp; DAYTO&nbsp; Y &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;'<br><br>GENORGA@ Rubrob, who as (sic) armed with a gun, shot Jose Miguel Quiros y Lopez hitting the latter at his trunk as a result thereof he sustained a fatal wound which resulted to his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of Jose Miguel Quiros y Lopez.<br><br>With&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Robbery with Homicide is committed in a dwelling and during night time.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>During their arraignment on July 8, 2011, appellants&nbsp; entered a plea of "not guilty."<br><br>The prosecution presented the testimonies of Abion, Lee Won Young (Lee),&nbsp; POl&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrian&nbsp; Alcon&nbsp; <i>(PO1&nbsp;&nbsp; Alcon)</i>,&nbsp; Florencio<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Mendoza&nbsp; (Mendoza), Nestor Laplap (Laplap), Maynard Malabanan (Malabanan), Miguel Alfonso Quiros y Yulo, and POl&nbsp; Mary Jennifer Encabo (POl&nbsp; Encabo).<br><br>Lee testified that on March 31,2011, he visited his friend Jose Miguel, the son of Quiros, in the latter's house to attend a birthday party the following day and to play a video game with him. After twenty (20) minutes of playing a video game with Jose Miguel, Lee asked permission to go to the toilet. Thereafter, Lee heard a gunshot&nbsp; prompting him to shout, <i>"Miguel, are you okay?,"</i> with no response from the latter. Miguel, looking shocked and soaked in blood that profusely oozing from his chest, ran towards&nbsp; Lee and saying, "Lee, there is a gun. A guy with a gun. I'd been shot. I'd been shot."&nbsp; Lee, then instinctively opened the door of the living room going to the main gate and called the guard on duty. Lee also called the attention of Miguel's father, who immediately went out of his room. They then brought Jose Miguel to the hospital, but was declared dead on arrival.<br><br>The police officers testified on their respective&nbsp; investigations&nbsp; on the case. Mendoza and Laplap, both employees of Visman Security Agency with which appellant Espineli was employed as a security guard when the incident occurred, testified that the same appellant arrived at the agency around 10:30 in the evening of March 31, 2011 and deposited&nbsp; his motorcycle&nbsp; outside the area of their jurisdiction and left.<br><br>Appellants Espineli, Dayto and Sanota interposed the defense of denial and alibi.<br><br>In his testimony, appellant&nbsp; Espineli claimed that he was on duty as a security&nbsp; guard&nbsp; at Avida&nbsp; Nuvali&nbsp; Settings,&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; at East&nbsp; II Roving&nbsp; in Barangay Mangumit, Canlubang, Calamba City on March 31, 2011, from 7:00&nbsp; a.m. to 7:00 p.m. After his duty, the same appellant was transferred to SIO Bravo and started his duty from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. of the following day.<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; Dayto,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; attended&nbsp; his brother's birthday celebration at General Trias, Cavite on March 31, 2011 and around&nbsp; 8:00&nbsp; p.m.&nbsp; of&nbsp; that&nbsp; day,&nbsp; he&nbsp; watched&nbsp; a&nbsp; television&nbsp; program&nbsp; while conversing with his common-law-wife until 10:00 p.m. before they fell asleep. He claimed to have stayed in General Trias until the arrival of his mother, brother and child from Bicol on April 3, 2011.<br><br>On his part, appellant John Sonata stated that on March 31, 2011, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., he was gathering wood in Sitio Hemedez, Barangay Malitit,&nbsp; Sta. Rosa,&nbsp; Laguna.&nbsp; Therefater,&nbsp; he went to the house&nbsp; of his friend where he took a rest and watched television.&nbsp; After having dinner with his friend's&nbsp; family around 8:00 p.m., he proceeded to the house of his father-in­ law's "kumpare."&nbsp; Thereafter, he went back to the house of his friend around 9:00p.m. and slept.<br><br>The RTC, on August 20,2014, promulgated its Decision convicting the appellants of the crime of Robbery with Homicide.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; premises considered,&nbsp; the Court finds the accused John&nbsp; Sanota,&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolando&nbsp; "Landoy"&nbsp;&nbsp; Espineli,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Deo&nbsp; "Rubrob"&nbsp;&nbsp; Dayto GUlLTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide punished under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; All three accused are hereby sentenced&nbsp; to suffer imprisonment&nbsp; of Reclusion Perpetua.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused are further ordered to pay, jointly, the amount of P383,764.65,&nbsp; as actual damages, P75,000[.00],&nbsp; as death indemnity, Pl,000,000.00 as moral damages, P200,000[.00]&nbsp; as exemplary damages, attorney's fees of P100,000[.00] and costs of suit<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>According to the RTC, all the elements of the crime of Robbery with Homicide are present.<br><br>Appellants sought further recourse to the CA.<br><br>The CA, in its Decision dated February 15, 2017, affirmed the decision of the RTC, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; the appealed Judgment rendered by Regional Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna, Branch 25 in Criminal Case No. 21888-B is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>The CA ruled that the prosecution was able to establish the guilt of all the accused beyond reasonable doubt. According to the CA, although there was no direct evidence to establish appellants' commission of the crime charged, circumstantial evidence suffices to convict them.<br><br>Hence, the present appeal. Appellants and the Office of the Solicitor General manifested to this Court that they are adopting their respective Briefs instead of filing Supplemental Briefs.<br><br>Appellants assigned the following errors:<br><blockquote><div align="center">I.<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF ROBBERY&nbsp; WITH HOMICIDE&nbsp; BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE DEDUCED FROM THE INCREDIBLE&nbsp; TESTIMONY&nbsp; OF&nbsp; PROSECUTION&nbsp; WITNESS, SANTIAGO ABION[,] JR.<br><br><div align="center">II. <br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAlLURE TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE&nbsp; DOUBT.<br><br><div align="center">III. <br></div><br>THE TRIAL&nbsp; COURT&nbsp; GRAVELY&nbsp; ERRED&nbsp; IN AWARDING&nbsp; ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND&nbsp; PESOS (PHPlOO,OOO.OO) AS ATTORNEY'S FEES SANS SUPPORTING&nbsp; DOCUMENT/RECEIPT. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>The appeal must fail.<br><br>The appellants argue that there was no direct proof presented by the prosecution on the events that led to the death of the victim, as well as the identity of the person or persons who shot the victim, nor was there any eyewitness to the actual taking of the missing laptop. They further insist that the testimony of Abion is incredible and does not warrant any consideration. Thus, absent any proof, appellants contend that the prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Time and again, this Court has deferred to the trial court's&nbsp; factual findings and&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; credibility of&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; when affirmed by the CA, in the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances that would justify altering or revising such findings and evaluation.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[9]</sup></font> This is because the trial court's&nbsp; determination&nbsp; proceeds from its first-hand opportunity to observe the demeanor&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp; conduct&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; attitude&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp; grilling examination, thereby placing the trial court in the unique position to assess the witnesses'&nbsp; credibility&nbsp; and to appreciate&nbsp; their truthfulness,&nbsp; honesty&nbsp; and candor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> As aptly ruled by the CA:<br><blockquote>The above contentions of appellants are inadequate to overturn the established fact that Abion, Jr. saw the appellants in Hacienda Otso, in front of Don Miguel Alfonso Quiros' residence in the evening of3l March 2016, when they robbed and killed Migs Quiros inside his house. While Abion, Jr.&nbsp; remained&nbsp; outside&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; as&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; by&nbsp; Espineli,&nbsp; his&nbsp; distance&nbsp; or position was merely twenty meters away from the scene of the crime. Thus, We uphold the ruling of the trial court.<br><br>The trial court correctly rejected the defense of alibi of the appellants for the reason that they were positively identified by prosecution eyewitness Santiago Abion, Jr. ("Abion, Jr.") who does not appear to have any motive against them to fabricate evidence. Also, the distance of eyewitness Abion, Jr. in relation to the scene of the crime does not preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of his presence at the locus criminis&nbsp; or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. Abion, Jr. alleged that at a distance of twenty (20) meters, he saw Landoy handed a gun to Rubrob. Rubrob then climbed the window of the house of Boss Coy. After five (5) minutes, a gunshot&nbsp; rang out, and Rubrob came out of the window with a gun on his right hand and a black thing on his left.<br><br>Hence, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence on record that on 31 March 2011, prior to the incident or at around 4:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the afternoon, prosecution witness Abion, Jr. saw herein appellants,&nbsp; John Sanota y Sarmiento,&nbsp; Deo Dayto y Genorga@ "Rubrob" and Rolando Espineli y Acebo@ "Landoy",&nbsp; having a drinking spree at the house&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Dayto.&nbsp;&nbsp; While&nbsp;&nbsp; feeding&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp; ducks,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; overheard&nbsp;&nbsp; appellants discussing their plan to rob a house located at Hacienda Otso.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>As&nbsp; such,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; finds&nbsp; no error&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; RTC's&nbsp;&nbsp; finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the testimony of Abion is credible.&nbsp; Again, [T]he assessment of the credibility of the&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; and&nbsp; their&nbsp; testimonies&nbsp; is&nbsp; best&nbsp; undertaken&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses first hand and to note&nbsp; their&nbsp; demeanor,&nbsp; conduct,&nbsp; and&nbsp; attitude&nbsp; under&nbsp; grueling&nbsp; examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> These factors are the most significant in evaluating the sincerity of witnesses and in unearthing the truth, especially in the face of conflicting testimonies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The factual findings of the RTC, therefore, are accorded the highest degree of respect especially if the CA adopted and confirmed these,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> unless some facts or circumstances of weight were overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted as to materially affect the disposition of the case. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; reason&nbsp; to&nbsp; justify the&nbsp; reversal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court's assessment and conclusion, as when no significant facts and circumstances are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded, the reviewing court is generally bound by the former's findings. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>What is important is that the prosecution was able to prove the existence of all the elements of the crime. The crime of robbery with homicide has been thoroughly discussed in People v. Ebet,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>In <i>People v. De Jesus,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> this Court had the occasion to meticulously expound on the nature of the crime of Robbery with Homicide, thus:<br><br>Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><br>Art. 294. <i>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons- Penalties.-&nbsp;</i> Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or any person shall suffer:<br><br>The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.<br><br>For the accused to be convicted of the said crime, the prosecution is burdened to prove the confluence of the following elements:<br><br>(1) the taking of personal property is committed&nbsp; with violence or intimidation against persons;<br><br>(2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is <i>animo lucrandi;</i> and (4) by reason of the robbery or on the occasion thereof, homicide is committed.</blockquote>In robbery with homicide, the original criminal design of the malefactor is to commit robbery, with homicide perpetrated on the occasion or by reason of the robbery. The intent to commit robbery must precede the taking of human life. The homicide may take place before, during or after the robbery. It is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes or modes or persons intervening in the commission of the crime that has to be taken into consideration. There is no such felony of&nbsp; robbery with homicide through reckless imprudence or simple&nbsp; negligence. The constitutive elements&nbsp; of the crime,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; robbery and homicide, must be consummated.<br><br>It is immaterial that the death would supervene by mere accident; or that the victim&nbsp; of homicide&nbsp; is other than the victim&nbsp; of robbery,&nbsp; or that two or more persons&nbsp; are killed or that aside from the homicide, rape, intentional mutilation, or usurpation of authority,&nbsp; is committed by reason or on the occasion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crime.&nbsp; Likewise&nbsp; immaterial is the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; victim&nbsp; of homicide is&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; robbers;&nbsp; the&nbsp; felony&nbsp; would&nbsp; still&nbsp; be&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; with homicide. Once&nbsp; a&nbsp; homicide&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; or&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; occasion of&nbsp; the robbery,&nbsp; the felony&nbsp; committed is robbery&nbsp; with&nbsp; homicide. All the felonies committed by reason of or on the occasion&nbsp; of the robbery are integrated&nbsp; into one and indivisible felony&nbsp; of robbery&nbsp; with homicide. The word "homicide" is used in its generic sense.&nbsp; Homicide, thus, includes&nbsp; murder, parricide, and infanticide.<br><br>Intent&nbsp; to rob&nbsp; is an internal&nbsp; act but may&nbsp; be inferred&nbsp; from&nbsp; proof&nbsp; of violent&nbsp; unlawful&nbsp; taking&nbsp; of personal&nbsp; property.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the fact of asportation has been established beyond&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; doubt, conviction of the accused&nbsp; is justified&nbsp; even if the property&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of the robbery&nbsp; is not presented&nbsp; in court. After all, the property&nbsp; stolen may have been abandoned or thrown away and destroyed by the robber&nbsp; or recovered&nbsp; by the owner.&nbsp; The prosecution is not burdened&nbsp; to prove&nbsp; the actual&nbsp; value of the property&nbsp; stolen&nbsp; or amount&nbsp; stolen from&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; victim.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; robber&nbsp;&nbsp; knew&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; actual&nbsp;&nbsp; amount&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the possession of the victim&nbsp; is of no moment&nbsp; because&nbsp; the motive&nbsp; for robbery can exist regardless of the exact amount&nbsp; or value involved.<br><br>When&nbsp;&nbsp; homicide&nbsp; is&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; reason&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; occasion&nbsp;&nbsp; of robbery, all those&nbsp; who took&nbsp; part as principals in the robbery&nbsp; would also be held liable as principals of the single and indivisible felony&nbsp; of robbery&nbsp; with homicide although they&nbsp; did&nbsp; not actually&nbsp; take&nbsp; part&nbsp; in the killing,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; it clearly&nbsp; appears that they endeavored to prevent&nbsp; the same.<br><br>&nbsp;If a robber&nbsp; tries&nbsp; to&nbsp; prevent&nbsp; the commission of&nbsp; homicide&nbsp; after&nbsp; the commission of the robbery,&nbsp; he is guilty only of robbery&nbsp; and not of robbery with&nbsp; homicide. All those&nbsp; who&nbsp; conspire&nbsp; to commit&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; with&nbsp; homicide are guilty&nbsp; as principals of such crime,&nbsp; although&nbsp; not all profited&nbsp; and gained from the robbery. One who joins a criminal&nbsp; conspiracy adopts&nbsp; the criminal designs&nbsp; of his co-conspirators and can no longer&nbsp; repudiate&nbsp; the conspiracy once it has materialized.<br><br>Homicide&nbsp; is&nbsp; said&nbsp; to&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; reason&nbsp; or&nbsp; on&nbsp; the occasion&nbsp; of robbery&nbsp; if, for&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; it was committed to (a) facilitate the robbery&nbsp; or the escape&nbsp; of the culprit;&nbsp; (b) to preserve the possession by the culprit&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; loot;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; to&nbsp; prevent&nbsp; discovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; the robbery;&nbsp; or, (d) to eliminate&nbsp; witnesses in the commission of the crime.&nbsp; As long&nbsp; as there&nbsp; is a nexus&nbsp; between&nbsp; the robbery&nbsp; and the homicide, the latter crime may be committed in a place other than the situs of the robbery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In this case, all the elements were proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>As to the contention of appellants that the prosecution failed to present any direct evidence that proves their participation in the commission of the crime, such does not deserve merit.&nbsp; Direct evidence of the commission of a crime is not the only basis on which a court draws its finding of guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The commission of a crime, the identity of the perpetrator,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and the finding of guilt may all be established by circumstantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In <i>Antonio Planteras, Jr. v.
