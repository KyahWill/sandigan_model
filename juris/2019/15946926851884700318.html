It keenly noted that two (2) days prior to the crime, January 13, 2000, appellants, armed with a gun went to Eusebio's house and threatened to kill him.

In <em><strong>People v. Zeta</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court held that the positive and credible testimony of eyewitnesses, even standing alone, is sufficient to support a verdict of conviction.</p><p>In <em><strong>People v. Rodrigo</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court further ruled that family members testify in the interest of seeing that justice is done so that they will act strictly according to the law despite their loss and grief.</p><p>Here, the fact that Eusebio and appellants had a long standing conflict over a piece of land does not automatically taint the credibility of Eusebio's children who positively identified appellants as the persons who killed their father. Being the children of Eusebio naturally impelled them to exact justice from the real assailants and definitely not from any "fall guys."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <em><strong>People v. Saltarin</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is in point, <em>viz</em>:</p><blockquote><p>xxx Narido's close relation with the victim whom he considered his <em>tatay-tatayan</em> is undisputed. But contrary to appellant's claim, it was precisely Narido's kindred spirit with his <em>tatay-tatayan</em> which impelled him to exact justice from appellant, the real assailant, and not just from some "fall guy." Besides, it is against the natural order of events, nay, human nature that a person would falsely testify against another if the latter had nothing to do with the crime.</p></blockquote><p>What lends further credence to the testimonies of Mario and Mary Jane is the medical report of Dr. Carmelita Carlos who examined Eusebio's body and found that he sustained a single penetrating wound in the right side of his chest and died of "hemorrhagic shock" resulting from a gunshot wound.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In <em><strong>Bautista v. CA and the People</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the Court was convinced that it was the accused who killed the victim because the physical evidence showing that the victim sustained fatal gunshot wounds firmly corroborated the eyewitness' account regarding the killing.</p><p>The fact that Eusebio's body was already embalmed when Dr. Carlos examined it does not negate the accuracy of the medical findings pertaining to Eusebio's injuries and cause of death. In <em><strong>People v. Gallego, et al.</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court held that although the victim's body was already embalmed when the medico-legal officer examined it, the number, locations, and depths of the wounds sustained by the victim as indicated in the medical findings were considered as sufficient proofs of the accused's intent to kill the victim.</p><p>At any rate, a medico-legal examination of the victim's body is not even an indispensable requirement for appellants' conviction here. It is sufficient that the prosecution was able to establish through the required quantum of proof that Eusebio was killed and it was appellants who killed him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p>Against the positive testimony and identification by the prosecution witnesses and the medico legal report on the fatal gunshot wound which caused Eusebio's death, Lito did not offer any defense while Dante merely invoked denial and alibi.</p><p>Dante Galam insists he was with his sister Amelia when the shooting incident happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p>We reiterate the rule that the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses of Dante being one of the two assailants of Eusebio prevails over Dante's alibi and denial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p>Besides, Dante failed to prove it was impossible for him to have been at the <em>situs criminis</em> on the same date and time the crime was committed. Eusebio's house was only five hundred (500) meters away from the onion field where Dante claimed to have been working when Eusebio was killed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p><p>More, an alibi when corroborated mainly by the relatives of the accused as in this case is regarded with extreme suspicion for it is easy to fabricate. Thus, <em><strong>People v. Ambatang</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> rejected the testimony of one of the defense witnesses who is the mother of the accused because she was not found to be an impartial witness.</p><p>As for Lito Galam, by not taking the stand or at least presenting a witness to testify in his defense, he totally failed to refute the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses that it was he who fatally shot the victim to death. In <em><strong>Ibañez, et al v. People</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the Court held the defense presented no other witness who had actually seen the stabbing incident to sufficiently rebut the prosecution's evidence and reverse their culpability. Both accused were found to have intentionally killed the victim through their concerted and coordinated action in attacking the victim. In <em><strong>People v. Panerio and Orteza</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the defense only presented accused Panerio as its sole witness. The Court, nonetheless, ruled that Orteza was equally culpable because he and Panerio were found to have conspired in killing the victim as manifested by their unity of intent and actions toward the same --- to end the victim's life.</p><p>As for Lito, <em><strong>People v. Villanueva</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> ordains that the prosecution's burden of proof does not shift to the defense but remains in the prosecution throughout the trial, except in case of self-defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> When the prosecution, however, has succeeded in discharging the burden of proof by presenting evidence sufficient to convince the Court of the truth of the allegations in the information or has established a prima facie case against the accused, as in this case, the burden of evidence shifts to the accused making it incumbent upon him or her to adduce evidence in order to meet and nullify, if not to overthrow, that prima facie case. Here, just like his brother Dante, Lito failed to discharge such burden of evidence. As it was, Lito did not even offer any defense on his behalf since the trial court heard the case up until now.</p><p><em><strong>Appellants conspired<br> in killing the victim</strong></em></p><p>The prosecution was able to sufficiently establish that appellants acted in concert to achieve one common purpose: to kill the victim. Thus: 1) they went together to Eusebio's house; 2) they engaged in a heated argument with Eusebio; 3) during their heated argument with Eusebio, Lito threatened Eusebio <em>"papatayin ka namin!"</em> while Dante cursed the victim <em>"putang-ina mo!;"</em> 4) Dante did not stop or prevent Lito when the latter drew his gun and shot Eusebio; and 5) they fled together after shooting Eusebio.</p><p>Appellants' individual and collective acts - before, during, and after the commission of the crime - indicated a joint purpose, concerted actions, and concurrence of sentiments<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> -- all geared toward killing Eusebio.</p><p>Conspiracy exists when "two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p><em><strong>Treachery and<br> evident premeditation<br> did not attend the killing</strong></em></p><p>For treachery to be appreciated as a qualifying circumstance, two (2) elements must concur: (1) the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (2) the means of execution was deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p>Here, appellants did not launch a surprise or sudden attack on Eusebio. The immediately preceding heated argument between appellants, on one hand, and Eusebio, on the other, including appellants' threat to kill Eusebio on the same occasion was sufficient warning to Eusebio of the impending fatal assault on his person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Notably, right before he was gunned down, Eusebio even challenged Lito to fire the gun pointed on him <em>"Sige, iputok mo!"</em> Eusebio, therefore, was not an "unsuspecting victim," nay, one who was completely oblivious of the impending danger to his life coming from his assailants.</p><p>Further, there was no showing that appellants consciously or deliberately adopted any particular means, method, or form of attack to ensure the commission of the crime without affording the victim any means to defend himself. The fact that Lito shot Eusebio in the chest by itself does not mean it was consciously and deliberately employed. The use of gun, does not necessarily imply treachery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p><p><em><strong>People v. Pilpa</strong></em> is relevant:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p><blockquote><p>xxx <strong>[M]ere suddenness of the attack is not sufficient to hold that treachery is present,</strong> where the mode adopted by the assailants does not positively tend to prove that they thereby <strong>knowingly intended</strong> to insure the accomplishment of their criminal purpose without any risk to themselves arising from the defense that the victim might offer. Specifically, it must clearly appear that the method of assault adopted by the aggressor was <strong>deliberately chosen</strong> with a view to accomplishing the act without risk to the aggressor.</p><p>In the case at bar, the testimonies of Leonila, Evangeline, and Carolina reveal that the assailants attacked the victim while the latter was having a seemingly random conversation with four friends in a public highway (Quirino Highway), and even in the presence of a <em>barangay tanod</em>, who later joined the group. Under these circumstances, the Court finds it difficult to agree that the assailants, including Pilpa, deliberately chose a particular mode of attack that purportedly ensured the execution of the criminal purpose without any risk to themselves arising from the defense that the victim might offer. To repeat, the victim was with five persons who could have helped him, as they had, in fact, helped him repel the attack. The Court thus fails to see how the mode of attack chosen by the assailants supposedly guaranteed the execution of the criminal act without risk on their end.</p><p align="center">xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</p><p>In addition, <strong>the attack itself was frontal</strong>. In People v. Tugbo, Jr., the Court held that treachery was not present because the attack was frontal, and hence, <strong>the victim had opportunity to defend himself.</strong> While a frontal attack, by itself, does not negate the existence of treachery, when the same is considered along with the other circumstances as previously discussed, it already creates a reasonable doubt in the existence of the qualifying circumstance. From the foregoing, the Court must perforce rule in favor of Pilpa and not appreciate the said circumstance. (Emphases added, citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p>On evident premeditation, the following elements must concur: (1) the time when the accused was determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between such determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the circumstances of his act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Evident premeditation to kill must be plain and notorious; it must be sufficiently proven by evidence of outward acts showing the intent to kill. In the absence of clear and positive evidence, mere presumptions and inferences of evident premeditation, no matter how logical and probable, are insufficient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p>Both the trial court and Court of Appeals here found that evident premeditation attended the victim's killing. They gave credence to Bartolome Antolin's testimony that appellants went to their house and threatened to kill their father Eusebio two (2) days before the killing took place. According to the courts, these circumstances indicated that appellants deliberately reflected on and planned for two (2) days how and when to kill Eusebio. From that time on until they made good their plan to kill Eusebio, there was a lapse of sufficient time (two [2] days) to contemplate and reflect on this plan.</p><p>We cannot agree.</p><p>In <em><strong>People v. Sarmiento</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court noted that the evidence revealed that two (2) days immediately preceding the fatal shooting, Sarmiento threatened to shoot the victim and expressed his intention to finish off the latter.
