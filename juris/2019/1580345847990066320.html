Procedurally, the COA assails the propriety of still allowing her petition for <i>certiorari </i>to prosper despite her failure to file the requisite, motion for reconsideration in the COA.

The rule is not rigid and set in stone, but admits of exceptions, like the following: (1) where the order is a patent nullity, such as when the court <i>a quo </i>had no jurisdiction; (2) where the questions raised in the <i>certiorari </i>proceedings have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court; (3) where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question, and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the Government or of the petitioner, or the subject matter of the action is perishable; (4) where a motion for reconsideration would be useless; (5) where the petitioner was deprived of due process, and there is extreme urgency for relief; (6) where, in a criminal case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent, and the granting of such relief by the trial court is improbable; (6) where the proceedings in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process; (7) where the proceeding was <i>ex parte, </i>or the petitioner had no opportunity to object; and (8) where the issue raised is one purely of law, or where public interest is involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The fourth and fifth exceptions are applicable.<br><br>To support her claim that the filing of the motion for reconsideration was useless, Estalilla avers that:<br><br><blockquote>32. From the time petitioner set out to have the disallowances overturned or obtain a relief from the liability decreed, respondent has consistently rejected petitioner's plea and stifled other efforts aimed at strengthening and supporting her cause. Respondent's Region IV-A Director Luz Loreto-Tolentino denied petitioner's Omnibus Motion seeking the lifting of the COA Order of Execution, Notice of Finality of Decision, and admission of her Appeal Memorandum on the ground that the disallowances have become final and executory. Long before petitioner received notice of the unfavorable resolution of her motion, respondent's General Counsel rejected petitioner's request for copies of the disbursement vouchers and ALOBS pertaining to the disallowed payments stating that <i>"the purpose for which the documents are requested will no longer be served" </i>because of petitioner's failure to perfect an appeal within the prescribed period.<br><br>33. Despite the above setbacks, petitioner pursued her cause before respondent, deprived of the information which the requested disbursement vouchers and ALOBs may have provided to bolster her cause. Similarly, however, respondent denied her appeal and flatly refused to consider it on its merits. This pattern of rejections clearly conveyed that no speedy and adequate relief awaits petitioner from a Motion for Reconsideration filed before respondent and resort thereof would be useless.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Estalilla's averments are valid. The futility of filing a motion for reconsideration against the COA's December 29, 2014 decision is not difficult to discern in the face of the COA's constant rejections of her efforts to defend herself from the disallowances based solely on the lapse of the period to appeal the NDs. Such stance already indicated the COA's inclination to invoke Section 4, Rule V of its Rules on the period to file an appeal in order to deny outright any reconsideration that Estalilla would seek. Any further attempt by her to convince the COA to reconsider her case would have been pointless and wasteful.<br><br>Furthermore, we reject the posture of the COA to the effect that Estalilla had been fully afforded her right to due process. To recall, she had insisted on her request to be furnished copies of the DVs and the ALOBs having been denied. Her insistence was not denied considering that the COA had been content in simply positing that she had lost the right to appeal by her failure to timely appeal the NDs. Hence, her right to due process had been unduly rebuffed. The COA should be reminded that her right to due process could be respected only if she had been afforded the opportunity to seek the meaningful recourse against the NDs. Unfortunately, the COA rejected the request for the copies of the DVs and the ALOBs on the sole basis of her not having appealed on time. Such rejection of her request was violative of her right to due process, for the DVs and the ALOBs pertained to her discharge of the duties of the municipal treasurer to certify to the availability of funds. Thus, the COA thereby gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>There was also the undeniable urgency of the relief sought in the face of the COA's order to withhold Estalilla's salary and benefits to answer for the disallowed amount of P35,591,200.00 by way of the solidary liability adjudged under the assailed decision of the COA.<br><br><div align="center"><b>II</b><br><b>Estalilla is not liable for the disallowed amounts</b><br></div><br>The Court generally observes the policy of sustaining the decisions of the COA on the basis both of the doctrine of separation of powers and of the COA's presumed expertise in the laws entrusted to it to enforce.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Unless the COA's decision or ruling is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, the Court will not review any errors allegedly committed by the COA. Accordingly, the Constitution and the <i>Rules of Court </i>provide the remedy of a petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the <i>Rules of Court </i>in order to restrict the scope of inquiry to errors of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the COA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In the proper cases, the Court determines whether or not there was on the part of the COA an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law, as when the judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on caprice, whim, and despotism.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Estalilla pleaded that the COA should admit her appeal on equitable considerations in view of the huge amount involved, and because of her limited participation in the questioned transactions; but the COA stood its ground, and upheld her personal liability for the disbursement of P35,591,200.00 in local funds on the ground that the NDs had meanwhile become final and executory.<br><br>We rule that the COA thereby gravely abused its discretion in imposing the personal liability against Estalilla.<br><br>The settled rule is that courts are bereft of jurisdiction to review decisions that have become final and executory. The rule safeguards the immutability of a final judgment, and is tenaciously applied and adhered to in order to preclude the modification of the final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous findings of fact and conclusions of law, and whether the modification is made by the court that rendered the judgments or by the highest court of the land. The evident objective of the rule is to definitively end disputes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Although the COA correctly cited the rule, the Court holds that the rule bows to recognized exceptions, like: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the making of so-called <i>nunc pro tunc </i>entries that cause no prejudice to any party; and (3) in case of void judgments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The Court has further allowed the relaxation of the rigid rule on the immutability of a final judgment in order to serve substantial justice in considering: (1) matters of life, liberty, honor or property; or (2) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; or (3) the merits of the case; or (4) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; or (5) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; or (6) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Several of the exceptions obtain in favor of Estalilla.<br><br>To begin with, Estalilla's case affected her right to life and property. Judicial notice is taken of the size of her salary as a municipal treasurer in comparison with the disallowed amount of P35,591,200.00. The huge disparity between her salary and the liability was glaring enough. To charge her with the solidary liability would produce very serious and dire consequences on her precious right to life and property. The consequences could impact negatively as well on the rest of her family. What makes the liability even harsher was that she had not personally derived any direct or personal benefit from the disallowed disbursements.<br><br>Also, the existence of compelling circumstances and the merits of her case, as well as the lack of any showing that she had committed any falsification in her certification on the availability of funds should be enough reason to undo the declaration of her personal liability by the COA.<br><br>Section 351 of the <i>Local Government Code </i>provides that expenditures of funds or use of property in violation of law shall be the personal liability of the official or employee responsible therefor. In that regard, in Section 16 of Circular No. 2009-006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the COA has listed the factors to be considered in determining the liability of public officers for disallowances, namely: (1) the nature of the disallowance/charge; (2) the duties and responsibilities of Officers/employees concerned; (3) the extent of their participation in the disallowed/charged transaction; and (4) the amount of damage suffered by or loss to the Government.<br><br>In Circular No. 2006-002,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the COA has further defined the responsibilities of the public officers involved in the disbursement of local government funds, thusly:<br><br><blockquote>2.0.

This limitation is based on Section 344 of Republic Act No. 7160 <i>(The Local Government Code), </i>which relevantly states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 344. <b><i>Certification, and Approval of, Vouchers.</i></b>—No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, <b>and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose.</b> x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Accordingly, Estalilla's plea that she was not personally liable by virtue of her having certified to the availability of funds in her capacity as the municipal treasurer should not fall on deaf ears. Her plea for relief had legal as well as factual support. As the municipal treasurer, her primary duty in relation to the disallowed disbursement was merely to certify to the availability of funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She had nothing to do with the disallowed disbursements beyond that.<br><br>The only time when Estalilla might be properly held personally liable for the disallowance would be if her certification of the availability of funds to cover the expenditures had been deliberately false. Such false certification, and a showing of other factors or circumstances of irregularities, would have invalidated the disbursement. But there was no showing of her having issued a false certification. As such, the COA gravely abused its discretion in holding her personally liable under the NDs without finding that she had certified falsely to the availability of funds.<br><br>By <i>grave abuse of discretion </i>is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The burden is on the part of petitioner to prove not merely reversible error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the public respondent issuing the impugned order. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the petition for <i>certiorari; </i><b>SETS ASIDE </b>the decision of the Commission on Audit dated December 29, 2014; and <b>MODIFIES </b>the Notice of Disallowance Nos. 2008-0430-101(05) and 2008-044-101(04) dated November 18, 2008 and November 25, 2008, respectively, the Notices of Finality of Decision dated March 26, 2012, and the corresponding Orders of Execution dated April 2, 2012, by <b>DELETING </b>that portion ordering the solidary liability of petitioner Elena A.
