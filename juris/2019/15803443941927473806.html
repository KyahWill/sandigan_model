He and his group gave chase and arrested the person at a carwash. The person was brought to Police Precinct No. 5. Letecia pointed to the person as one of her husband's attackers.

Puertollano and Attorney II Joseph Benjamin P. Tagsa defended the verdict of conviction and argued that (1) notwithstanding Letecia's failure to recognize appellant in court, the testimonies of SPO4 Ausejo and his co-accused Renato and Junjun positively identified him as one (1) of the authors of the crime, and (2) the concerted acts of appellant and his co-accused resulted to Ruben's murder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b><br></center><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated November 11, 2014, the Court of Appeals affirmed in the main.

It, nonetheless, ruled that appellant and his co-accused still committed murder by taking advantage of their superior strength when they surrounded and attacked the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court of Appeals found that although Letecia failed to positively identify Batulan in open court, the prosecution still sufficiently proved his guilt. The testimonies of SPO4 Ausejo, Renato Fuentes and Junjun Fuentes weaved appellant's guilt with certainty. More, the bloodied Batangas knife<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> was positively identified in court by Letecia and SPO4 Ausejo as the same weapon used to stab the victim and recovered from appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the principle of <i>res inter alios acta</i> was inapplicable since the testimonies of Renato Fuentes and Junjun Fuentes were given in open court where they were subjected to cross-examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Present Appeal</b><br></center><br>Appellant now seeks affirmative relief and prays anew for his acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In compliance with the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> dated June 15, 2015, the OSG and appellant manifested<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> that in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs submitted before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming appellant's conviction for murder?<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal utterly lacks merit.<br><br><b><i>Appellant was positively identified as one of the victim's assailants</i></b><br><br>Despite Letecia's failure to positively identify Batulan in open court, the Court of Appeal correctly found that that appellant's guilt was sufficiently established by other credible and competent evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Appellant's co-accused Renato Fuentes and Junjun Fuentes testified that appellant stabbed the victim in the neck, using a Batangas knife, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Renato:<br><br>Q: After that what happened?<br>A: Suddenly, this Batulan ran towards the driver and stabbed him on the neck.</b><br><br>xxx xxx xxx<br><br>Q: When that person Batulan stabbed that driver, what happened to the driver?<br>A: The driver fell to the ground.<br><br>Q: Earlier, you said that the driver had the sharp bladed weapon at the time when that Batulan stabbed him. Was the driver still holding the said bladed weapon?<br>A: Yes, Sir, but he was facing with Alvin Pagapulaan and Batulan came from his right side he did not see him.<br><br>Q: Now, you said that Batulan. Whose person are you referring to? <br>A: He is here in the courtroom.<br><br>Q: Who is that person?<br>INTERPRETER: Witness is pointing to a man inside the courtroom.<br><br>COURT: You go to the person?<br>INTERPRETER: Witness step from the witness stand and tap the shoulder of the person inside the courtroom.

They vividly narrated how appellant attacked and stabbed Ruben in the neck using a Batangas knife. Appellant cannot discredit their testimonies by merely invoking the principle of <i>res inter alios acta</i>.<br><br>The principle of <i>res inter alios acta</i> provides that the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This rule, however, applies to extrajudicial declarations or admissions. It does not apply to testimonies given on the witness stand where the party adversely affected had the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Here, the statements of Renato and Junjun identifying appellant as one of the victim's assailants were made in open court on direct examination. Further, when cross-examined, Renato and Junjun did not waver, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><b>Renato (on cross-examination):</b><br><br>xxx xxx xxx<br><br>Q: Now, in your testimony, you are making it appear that it was Batulan who stab Ruben Pacho with a batangas knife? <br>A: Yes, Your Honor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><b>Junjun (on cross- examination):</b><br><br>Q: Now, are you trying to tell this Honorable Court that it was only Batulan who suddenly appear from nowhere and try to kill Ruben Pacho.

Consolacion;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (b) SPO4 Ausejo and his team chased appellant from the crime scene to Brgy. Consolacion; (c) they found appellant standing in an abandoned warehouse holding a blood-stained knife;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (d) the blood-stained knife<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> was later identified in court as the same blood-stained knife recovered from appellant and one of the weapons used to stab the victim. These circumstances constitute an unbroken chain which leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion that appellant is guilty as charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Verily, Batulan's conviction is supported by evidence on record other than Letecia's testimony.<br><br><b><i>Appellant acted in conspiracy with his co-accused</i></b><br><br>In another vein, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly found that appellant acted in conspiracy with his co-accused.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two (2) or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. It arises on the very instant the plotters agree, expressly or impliedly, to commit the felony and forthwith decide to pursue it. What is important is that all participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to unmistakably indicate a common purpose to bring about the death of the victim. Once this is established, each of the conspirators is made criminally liable for the crime actually committed by any one of them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Here, the following circumstances established conspiracy: (1) all four accused knew each other as they were dispatchers or jeepney barkers in the area where the crime was committed;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (2) they were all present at the time of the killing; (3) they surrounded Ruben when he alighted his jeepney;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (4) they took turns hitting, hacking and stabbing Ruben with a stone, samurai and a knife;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (5) Ruben sustained multiple injuries and wounds from the attacks;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and (6) all four accused immediately escaped.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The acts of appellant and his co-accused were coordinated. They were synchronized in their attacks and were motivated by a single criminal impulse - to kill Ruben. Their spontaneous agreement to commit the crime is sufficient to create joint criminal responsibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Conspiracy being present, appellant is thus equally liable as his co-accused regardless of who delivered the killing blow. For where there is conspiracy, all conspirators are liable as co-principals. The act of one is the act of all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><b><i>Abuse of superior strength, not treachery, qualified the killing to murder</i></b><br><br>As regards the appreciation of treachery as a qualifying circumstance, the facts establishing it must be sufficiently alleged in the Information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Any objection against its sufficiency in the Information must be raised during trial proper. Otherwise, it is deemed waived. For the accused effectively allowed the prosecution to particularize the elements of treachery through the presentation of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>The Court, nevertheless, agrees that treachery did not attend the killing. Here, there was no showing that appellant deliberately chose his method of attack to ensure the accomplishment of the crime without risk of retaliation coming from the victim.<br><br>On the other hand, abuse of superior strength qualified the killing to murder. This circumstance is appreciated whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and his aggressors, and the latter took advantage of such inequality to facilitate the commission of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>To take advantage of superior strength means to purposely use excessive force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked. Unlike in treachery, where the victim was not given the opportunity to defend himself or repel the aggression, taking advantage of superior strength does not mean that the victim was completely defenseless. It is determined by the excess of the aggressor's natural strength over that of the victim, considering the momentary position of both and the employment of means weakening the defense, although not annulling it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Here, it is evident that appellant and his co-accused took advantage of their number and weapons to put the victim at a notorious disadvantage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The four (4) accused took turns in hacking Ruben with the samurai. They also stabbed him with a knife and hit his nape with a rock causing his head to crack. The balance of strength excessively tilted in their favor. Appellant and his co-accused overwhelmed the victim with their sudden synchronized assault.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> A disparity in strength and number was clear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>The fact that Ruben attempted to fend off Pagapulaan with a samurai did not automatically negate abuse of superior strength. For when the four (4) accused ganged up on him during the squabble, they managed to disarm Ruben. In contrast, they armed themselves with the samurai, a knife and a stone. Obviously, the force they used far exceeded the means of defense available to Ruben. All told, abuse of superior strength qualified his killing to murder.<br><br><b><i>Penalty</i></b><br><br>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, murder is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. There being no aggravating circumstance, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly sentenced appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Following recent jurisprudence however,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the awards of civil indemnity and moral damages are increased to P75,000.00 each.
